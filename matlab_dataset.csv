2018-08-01,The Huffington Post,CNNs Jim Acosta Warns Anti-Media Hostility Is Going To Get Someone Hurt,"Acosta, the outlets senior White House correspondent, shared a video of his encounter with the presidents supporters late Tuesday, including footage of rally-goers wearing shirts reading Fuck the Media and others screaming stop lying.

Just a sample of the sad scene we faced at the Trump rally in Tampa, Acosta wrote. Im very worried that the hostility whipped up by Trump and some in conservative media will result in somebody getting hurt.

He continued: We should not treat our fellow Americans this way. The press is not the enemy.

Other footage of angry rally goers chanting CNN sucks was quickly shared by Trumps son, Eric, who added a simple addendum reading Truth. The message was later retweeted by the president.

The video reflects a growing divide between many members of the press and Trumps supporters. The president recently doubled down on his attacks, telling those gathered at a convention in Kansas City, Mo, not to believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news.

Just remember: What youre seeing and what youre reading is not whats happening, he said.

Acosta himself has become a frequent target of such ire and was berated and told to go home at another event in June.

Tuesdays rally sparked criticism from many, including former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who said the free press needs to be protected as well as their opinions.

I dont always agree and am often upset with journalists but we are flashing warning lights now that we shouldnt be flashing, he wrote.

This isnt our best. Its not who we are. I dont always agree and am often upset with journalists but we are flashing warning lights now that we shouldnt be flashing. The free press needs to be protected as well as their opinions. Thats why that Amendment was First. https://t.co/6QQhPzK78n  Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) August 1, 2018

The warnings echo another made by a leading media figure in recent days. A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times, said he met with Trump earlier this month for an off-the-record conversation. The president then tweeted about the encounter, prompting Sulzberger to release a statement about his opposition to Trumps treatment of the media.

My main purpose for accepting the meeting was to raise concerns about the presidents deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric, Sulzberger said. I told the president directly that I thought that his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous.

I told him that although the phrase fake news is untrue and harmful, I am far more concerned about his labeling journalists the enemy of the people, he continued. I warned that this inflammatory language is contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence."
2018-10-22,The Huffington Post,Few People Want To Be Poll Workers And Thats A Problem,"Seth Wenig / The Associated Press Poll workers direct voters at a New York polling station during the 2016 presidential election. Poll workers are older, less prepared and becoming scarcer.

They greet you at the plastic folding table set up in your neighborhoods library, church or fire station, asking you for your name, address and, depending on your state, photo ID before handing you a ballot or directing you to a voting machine. More than just glorified receptionists, these underpaid few are really the gatekeepers to democracy.

I recognize that being a poll worker is not the most glamorous job, Abney said. People might not even be aware of it. Being a poll worker is an underappreciated job, but they provide a critical service to the public. We want to make sure people know this is an opportunity that exists.

He has traveled around Pennsylvania, showing up at community events and local election offices to spread the word of their initiative. After all, he tells people, its an opportunity to be civically engaged and get paid. There is no set salary for poll workers statewide, but poll workers in Allegheny County, for example, earn between $115 and $140 a day.

Cherie DeBrest was ready to sign up to be a poll worker in Pennsylvania. For 18 years, she worked with parents and caregivers as a social worker at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, guiding them through the obstacles of medical care. Over the last three presidential elections, DeBrest, 49, led voter registration drives at the hospital, registering staff and the family members of patients whenever she could.

Until this election, though, she never sought to become a poll worker on Election Day. For years, shes noticed poll workers were much older than her. Who, other than retirees, has the time to take off work on a Tuesday, she thought. But when she saw the city was looking for new poll workers, she figured it was time to act. I was already thinking about it, she said. Theres no time like the present, so I got on the website and signed up.

The benefits of younger poll workers are undeniable, said Sherry Poland, the director of elections in Hamilton County, Ohio. They bring enthusiasm, energy and a familiarity and comfort with technology like electronic poll books and optical ballot scanners, she said. They also are more likely to remain poll workers for future elections.

In 2016, Ohio, California, Delaware and Michigan were the only states where more than 10 percent of poll workers were 25 or younger, according to the Election Assistance Commission. (Washington, D.C. also beat the 10 percent standard, which was the national average.) A quarter of poll workers in California were 25 and younger.

In certain states, nonvoters, many of whom speak a foreign language, also can serve as poll workers. Since 2013, lawful permanent residents in California have been able to serve as poll workers, and many may be able to help the over 2.6 million eligible voters in the state who arent fully proficient in English, according to Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Los Angeles.

Im passionate about putting my words into action and bringing people with me, she said. Hopefully, when they see that I followed through on everything I was preaching about voter engagement, they will feel motivated to do the same."
2018-03-23,The Huffington Post,Teens Call Out The NRA Gun Makers And Politicians In Powerful New March Promo,"We see these lawmakers representing the NRA, and not their constituents. We see our leaders making excuses and refusing to act. On Saturday, theyll see US. pic.twitter.com/7OGttnRSsz"
2018-07-16,The Huffington Post,Fox Hosts Offer Rare Criticism Of Trump After Russian Summit,"President Donald Trumps odd deference to Russia is losing him some of his biggest fans: Fox News hosts.

Both before and after Trumps one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday, Foxs on-air talent was uncharacteristically critical of the U.S. leader.

It started with Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade, who called Trump ridiculous for his pre-meeting tweet claiming that U.S. foolishness and stupidity were to blame for the two countries deteriorating relationship:

Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018

Thats by far the most ridiculous tweet of late, Kilmeade said, and that is insulting to past administrations. He cant be saying that going into the Russian summit.

Things didnt improve post-summit when Trump stood alongside Putin at a press conference and disputed well-substantiated U.S. intelligence reports that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Its not a right or left thing to me  its just wrong, he said. A U.S. president on foreign soil talking to our biggest enemy ... is essentially letting the guy get away with this. And not even offering a mild criticism.

Cavuto later said  perhaps jokingly  that he thinks the president deserves the benefit of the doubt, speculating that Trumps poor performance came down to maybe jet lag and time differences. (Trump has been in Europe for nearly a week.)

Fox & Friends co-host Abby Huntsman  daughter of Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia  was not so forgiving, suggesting that Trump had thrown America under the bus:"
2018-07-25,The Huffington Post,These Candidates Could Be Americas First Muslim Women In Congress,"The women are part of a record wave of Muslim candidates running for office in 2018, alongside unprecedented numbers of women running since Trumps election and a movement of progressive candidates seeking to push the Democratic Party establishment further left. Several of the candidates were endorsed by the Justice Democrats  the progressive political group that backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York in her now-famous upset win.

Tlaib, who grew up the eldest of 14 children, is running on a progressive platform, including supporting Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage. She told HuffPost shes going to abolish ICE  a leftist stance that has recently gained traction among a few leading Democrats (including lawmakers expected to run in 2020) since Ocasio-Cortez ran on that idea and won. Tlaib has received Ocasio-Cortezs backing, and like the New York candidate, doesnt accept money from corporate PACs.

I hope my candidacy would allow people to have the boldness to encourage people who dont fit into [a] particular demographic to seek office, she told HuffPost that year. To believe in the good will of the people to select someone they believe shares their vision and not necessarily their identity.

Following her career in public service, first during the Obama administration in the Department of Homeland Security working on terrorism, then as director of Detroits office of immigrant affairs, Saad decided to run for public office after Trumps election, pushed by what she saw as the American Dream being threatened by Trump and the Republican Congress that continues to enable him.

Ive always navigated in spaces where Im the only person like me, and a lot of the spaces Im in are predominantly white, the black, Muslim candidate based in western Massachusetts told HuffPost in April. Theres a universality to my story, and my message and my platform that allows people to appreciate me beyond my race.

Abboud, who previously contributed to HuffPosts open blogging platform, wrote last October that she knew people would look at her as The Muslim Candidate if she entered politics. I am not the Muslim candidate, she wrote. I am an American candidate, a Democratic candidate, a grassroots candidate and, yes, I happen to be Muslim."
2018-07-17,The Huffington Post,Donald Trump Actually Thinks Vladimir Putin Meeting Went Well,So youre calling Fox fake news now too? Is there any news that isnt fake as it pertains to you? You were on tv..everyone saw your treason live! Your meeting with NATO was also a disaster and you did nothing but act a fool on the world stage once again. #TreasonSummit
2018-08-29,The Huffington Post,Progressives Will Lead Democrats In Some Of 2018s Biggest Contests,"For years, as Democratic turnout sagged in midterm elections, progressive candidates argued they were the solution: They could excite young and minority voters who often stayed home and defeat the Republicans who relied on an older, whiter electorate to dominate in midterm elections.

The Democratic establishment, and Democratic voters, largely rejected that argument during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Instead, they nominated moderate candidates designed to win over swing voters who were certain to vote. In four straight gubernatorial elections, from 2002 to 2014, Florida Democrats picked white moderates from the Tampa area as their standard-bearers in the nations fourth-largest state. The strategy peaked in 2014, when they nominated Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor. All four candidates lost.

This year, with the party at historic lows at the state level  Democrats control just 13 governorships  and President Donald Trump in the White House, voters in Florida have made a much different choice. They nominated 39-year-old Andrew Gillum, the African-American mayor of Tallahassee who has promised to focus as much on turning voters out as on winning them over.

Its a repeat of a choice Democratic primary electorates have also made in Georgia, where they picked state Rep. Stacey Abrams, who has built a career out of registering new voters; in Maryland, where Ben Jealous is banking on a blue wave; and in Arizona, where David Garcia  another primary winner on Tuesday  is counting on the excitement of the possibility of the first Latino governor in 40 years to fire up Latino voters.

All four candidates  Gillum, Jealous and Abrams are black, and Garcia is Latino  are counting on a coalition of minority voters and white liberals as their path to victory, with a dash of help from suburban moderates turned off by Trump. Their nominations represent a tactical sea change for the party compared with four years ago, when centrists were nominated in all four states. And they give progressives their best chances in years to prove that their theory of how to win the midterms is the right one.

Andrew Gillums massive upset victory tonight is an explosive development in the 2018 election that definitively proves that the New American Majority of people of color and progressive white voters are ready to deliver transformative results for candidates, Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of the progressive group Democracy for America, said in a statement Tuesday night. Tonight, Floridians made it clear that the time for fundamental progressive change in the Sunshine State is here.

In an interview last summer, not long after he launched his campaign, Gillum was already committed to a progressive strategy. Im not going to shrink from what, frankly, drew me to the Democratic Party, he said. Our message has been to be non-offensive. It hasnt worked.

And he stuck to it. Gillum adopted almost every position on the progressive wish list. He supports abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He supports Medicare for all and a ban on assault weapons. He spoke personally about the need for greater police accountability and criminal justice reform, issues that disproportionately affect people of color.

Meanwhile, the candidate he narrowly beat, former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, had spent two years in Congress voting against allowing Syrian refugees into the United States and for provisions that progressives saw as weakening the Affordable Care Act.

But Jealous strategy in Maryland doesnt require dragging Hogan into the mud. Defeating Hogan is about turning out Democrats, he said in June, noting his partys two-to-one voter registration edge. If this was about persuading moderate Republicans to vote for a Democrat, Id be the wrong choice.

The other progressive candidates Democrats have nominated likely wouldnt go as far as Jealous. Abrams has bipartisan credentials from her time leading Democrats in the state legislature and has worked to woo the business community after Republicans nominated arch-conservative Brian Kemp in the GOP primary. Garcia has previously run for office with the backing of business, and he believes his background as a veteran gives him credibility with conservatives and moderates.

And Democratic voters havent completely tossed moderates aside: The cycle began with Virginia Gov. Ralph Northams triumph, and saw victories for Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama and Rep. Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, an avowed centrist, just won the Democratic nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona."
2018-08-01,The Huffington Post,Kirsten Gillibrand Pays The Price For Speaking Out Against Al Franken,"Angela Weiss/Getty Images Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was the first senator to publicly call on her colleague, Al Franken, to resign after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct.

But the two-term senator cemented her prominence in the movement last year when she called out members of her own party. In November, she said that Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And then the following month, she became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to go after multiple women accused him of engaging in sexual misconduct.

Gillibrand wasnt the only senator to publicly call on Franken to step down, but she was the first (but only by minutes) in a wave of female senators  who were eventually joined by many of their male colleagues on the same day, Dec. 6  to do so. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, reportedly told Franken in private that he needed to go beforehand.

I Think It Was A Big Mistake

Theres also a theory, readily found on social media, that Franken was the target of a right-wing hit job centered around Leeann Tweeden, the first woman to accuse Franken of groping her without her consent, who appears to be conservative-leaning. But besides Tweeden, there were seven other women who said Franken harassed them, and four of them were on the record. Several of the incidents also occurred while he was either in office or running for office.

Part of the reason Franken faced so much pressure to resign was that there was a heated campaign to win the U.S. Senate race in Alabama underway. Frankens problems were a distraction at a time the party was hammering Republican Roy Moore, who was facing allegations of pursuing teenage girls while he was an adult. The senator resigning without a fight was no doubt, in part, an acknowledgment to the politics of the moment.

Why Are We Making This About Her?

Gillibrand has also had other discussions in the wake of the matter, including calling some other prominent Democratic women in the San Francisco area who are friends with Tompkins Buell. According to someone with knowledge of the situation, the senator reached out to them to explain why she believed Franken needed to go, and shes been willing to talk about her views with people who are skeptical and have questions.

Did she do it because she wanted to position herself for president? Gee, Im shocked. People do that all the time. Why is this issue a no-go? Is Bernie [Sanders] taking advantage of single-payer and putting people in an uncomfortable position by being so aggressive about that? We say its not the same, but it is the same. Its getting a different frame because its squeezing the old-boy network."
2018-10-25,The Huffington Post,China Trolls Trump Over Report Its Hacked His iPhone,"President Donald Trump reportedly continues to use his personal iPhone for business instead of a more secure government-supplied device, despite ample evidence that China and Russia have hacked the phone and are eavesdropping on his calls.

Theres its blanket denial of having done anything wrong, of course. But in an unusual statement Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying also struck a mocking tone, going so far as to suggest Trump just use a Chinese manufactured phone instead.

If one is concerned about Apple cellphones being hacked, they can switch to using Huawei cellphones, Hua said.

The suggestion is notable, as Huawei phones are all but banned in the U.S. over security concerns. In February, the heads of the CIA, FBI, National Security Agency and the director of national intelligence implored U.S. companies to steer clear of Huawei, which FBI Director Chris Wray warned was beholden to foreign governments.

Hua also employed a decidedly Trumpian phrase in her dismissal of the original New York Times story, calling it fake news.

And if a Huawei device is not secure enough, Hua suggested the Trump administration just cease communicating altogether:

If they are still not at ease, she said, then in order to have an entirely secure device, they can stop using all forms of modern communication devices and cut off all ties with the outside world."
2018-09-27,The Huffington Post,Trump Didnt Have A Meeting Scheduled With Trudeau But He Canceled It Anyway,"President Donald Trump claimed he snubbed a meeting request from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the United Nations this week. Ive told him forget about it, Trump remarked Wednesday during a news conference on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.

Canada, however, was quick to cry foul. No such meeting was ever requested, a Trudeau spokesman told CNN, adding: We do not have any comment beyond that.

The back and forth about the supposed meeting comes amid the U.S. and Canadas acrimonious renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and follows months of souring relations between the two North American neighbors.

Speaking at the news conference, Trump alleged he refused a one-on-one meeting with Trudeau because of Canadas high dairy tariffs and poor negotiating style. He also took a shot at Canadas representative in the NAFTA negotiations, an apparent reference to Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, who has been leading Canadas negotiations with the U.S.

Trudeaus tariffs are too high, and he doesnt seem to want to move, and Ive told him forget about it, and frankly, were thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada, Trump said. Thats the mother lode. Thats the big one.

He added: Were very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada. We dont like their representative very much.

President Trump rejected a one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau. He complained that Canadas tariffs were too high and said that we dont like their representative very much.

Trudeau and Trump were captured on camera briefly shaking hands on Tuesday during a luncheon for world leaders.

Trudeau, who was standing, tapped Trumps shoulder to greet him. The U.S. president stayed seated as he extended his hand for a cursory handshake. Trumps decision to stay seated during the exchange has been described as a snub and as showing a lack of diplomatic etiquette.

Trump and Trudeau share a rocky history. In June, after the G7 summit, Trudeau told reporters that Canada would retaliate with tariffs of its own following the imposition of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.

In response, Trump lambasted the prime minister on Twitter as being very dishonest & weak.

The U.S. has suggested it will forge a new NAFTA deal with just Mexico if it fails to reach an accord with its northern neighbor."
2018-07-25,The Huffington Post,Dying Progressive Activist Films Ad For Ohio Democrat In Close Election,"Your family and my family are gonna pay the price for the tax cuts, Barkan says in the ad, his speech slurred due to the advancement of ALS. So now Im asking you to be a hero.

Barkan, a leader of the Center for Popular Democracy, a community organizing umbrella group, rose to national prominence during the fight over the GOP tax cuts in December, when he confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on a plane about the legislation. At the time, Barkan asked Flake to be an American hero and vote down the bill, but Flake and his Republican colleagues voted for it.

Barkan subsequently made it his mission to oust Republican lawmakers who backed the tax cuts or defeat Republican candidates who support them. He fittingly named the political group behind his initiative the Be A Hero Fund, under the auspices of his employers Center for Popular Democracy Action. He has crisscrossed the country to speak at town halls and rallies advocating against the tax cuts and for health care access.

The ad was produced under the Be A Hero PAC, an entirely different group Barkan formed to spend directly in elections. Barkan is launching a social media-driven crowdfunding campaign to finance a six-figure ad buy in the district. The first tweet will request contributions in increments of $12.

National Republican groups, spooked by liberal enthusiasm and the relatively lackluster fundraising of OConnors Republican opponent, state Sen. Troy Balderson, are again enormously outspending Democratic groups to maintain their hold on the once-safe seat. (Democrats have not won the seat since 1980.)

The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), has already spent $2 million on television advertising alone. And the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party arm charged with electing more GOP House members, has spent $600,000 on the race.

By contrast, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has taken a more cautious approach  buying $238,000 worth of airtime for an ad attacking Balderson. (The DCCC and the Democratic National Committee have both contributed an unspecified additional amount in in-kind resources, such as staff.)

Troy Balderson is possibly one of the worst guys in the country when it comes to health care and the needs of his constituents, Barkan said of his decision to get involved in the race.

Barkan has already played a major role in some competitive races, notably the April 24 special election for Arizonas 8th Congressional District. While campaigning in the district for Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, he confronted Republican Debbie Lesko about GOP plans to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Lesko professed her ignorance about remarks by House Speaker Ryan and others openly declaring that social programs were next on the chopping block.

Barkan subsequently used footage of the exchange in an ad he cut in support of Tipirneni, who pledged to shield Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid from cuts. Another progressive group, the Working Families Party, managed to raise $100,000 to finance airtime for the spot.

Tipirneni lost, but the way Barkan sees it, her showing was strong enough to demonstrate that his efforts can have an effect in key races.

Balderson and his GOP allies have toggled from ads blasting OConnor for opposing the Republican tax cuts to more recent spots tying him to the liberal Resistance movement and even former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland (D). An ad currently on the air that was funded jointly by Baldersons campaign and the NRCC mentions opposition to the tax cuts, but only in the context of a litany of other liberal offenses. (In fact, OConnor has said he supports the middle-class tax cuts, but not the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.)"
2018-03-04,The Huffington Post,Trump Praises Chinese President For Extending Tenure For Life,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping Saturday after the ruling Communist party announced it was eliminating the two-term limit for the presidency, paving the way for Xi to serve indefinitely, according to audio aired by CNN.

Hes now president for life, president for life. And hes great, Trump said, according to audio of excerpts of Trumps remarks at a closed-door fundraiser in Florida aired by CNN. And look, he was able to do that. I think its great. Maybe well have to give that a shot someday, Trump said to cheers and applause from supporters.

It is not clear if Trump, 71, was making the comment about extending presidential service in jest. The White House did not respond to a request for comment late Saturday.

U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat, said on Twitter that whether this was a joke or not, talking about being President for life like Xi Jinping is the most unAmerican sentiment expressed by an American President. George Washington would roll over in his grave.

U.S. presidents by tradition served a maximum of two four-year terms until President Franklin Roosevelt was elected a record four times starting in 1932. An amendment to the U.S. Constitution approved in 1951 limits presidents to two terms in office.

In order to change the current prohibition, it would require initial support of two-thirds of both houses of Congress or support of two-thirds of state legislatures - and then would need to be ratified by three-quarters of the states.

Chinas annual parliament gathering kicks off on Monday as Xi presses ahead with efforts to ward off financial risks without undermining the economy. The Communist party announced on Feb 25 the end of the two-term limit for the president - and the parliament is expected to ratify the move.

During the remarks, Trump praised Xi as a great gentleman and added: Hes the most powerful (Chinese) president in a hundred years. Trump said Xi had treated him tremendously well during his visit in November.

Trump has often praised Xi, but in January Trump told Reuters the United States was considering a big fine as part of a probe into Chinas alleged theft of intellectual property. He has been critical of Chinas trade policies.

Trump told The New York Times in December that because of North Korea he had been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war."
2018-09-24,The Huffington Post,How Trump Can Use Welfare To Stymie Immigration And Vice Versa,"Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has said the proposed rule change would promote immigrant self-sufficiency and protect finite resources by ensuring that they are not likely to become burdens on American taxpayers.

The U.S. government has almost always had a rule against legal permanent resident status for anyone who might become a public charge, meaning someone who is likely to wind up on welfare. The proposed rule, which will not take effect for at least 60 days and is subject to change, would broaden the criteria the government can use to deny applicants.

The proposal will likely scare immigrants out of applying even for benefits that wouldnt hurt their green card chances, Cervantes said, such as food stamps for their children. Already, officials in several states have reported sharp declines in child nutrition program enrollment that they attribute to earlier news reports about the possibility of a new public charge rule. (The final proposed rule considers only an individuals use of public benefits, not any use by their dependents.)

Experts said its impossible to estimate how many people will be affected by the rule, but some said it could be in the millions  some directly because they would be denied a green card, others indirectly because they declined to use a benefit out of fear or because a family member was kept away.

The Department of Homeland Security said in its proposal that it estimated more than 324,000 people would disenroll from safety net benefits due to concern about the consequences to that person receiving public benefits and being found to be likely to become a public charge, saving the federal government more than $2 billion annually. (Thats less than 1 percent of what the government spends on food and health benefits for the poor each year.) The proposed rule wouldnt make those individuals ineligible for public benefits  the administration is predicting it would cause people to not use help even if they were qualified for it.

Cervantes said the proposal as written would affect several million people if you count a program beneficiarys family members. More than 40 percent of the nearly 40 million food stamp recipients in the U.S., for instance, are children whose parents receive the benefits on their behalf.

Immigrants could be fearful of enrolling their families in certain benefits even if they wouldnt have an adverse effect on a future immigration decision, either because of confusion about what is included or fear that it could be expanded in the future, said Melissa Boteach, senior vice president at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, who works on poverty issues.

People are confused, and the stakes are too high for them to make an educated guess, Boteach said. I think theres a sense that even if you are technically exempt, who knows what theyll do next?

Undocumented immigrants and people on work visas are ineligible for most federal benefits in the first place, and green card holders are only eligible after five years. The proposal would not affect people applying to become U.S. citizens. It primarily targets people abroad hoping to be reunited with family members living in the U.S. and those already living here and seeking green cards.

In fiscal 2017, the State Department initially denied more than 280,000 immigrant visa applications. Of those, only 3,200 were refused on public charge grounds, according to the Congressional Research Service (most of those refusals were overcome on appeal). Cervantes said the number of public charge refusals would likely skyrocket under the new proposal.

The current public charge guidance considers a persons age, education, assets and employment status, as well as his or her current enrollment in a small number of state and federal programs. Republicans have long complained that the biggest programs, such as food stamps and Medicaid, were excluded. The Trump administrations rule would broaden the criteria to include most federal safety net benefits.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement announcing the proposal that it would implement a law passed by Congress intended to promote immigrant self-sufficiency and protect finite resources by ensuring that they are not likely to become burdens on American taxpayers.

The current guidance says an immigrant would only count as a public charge if he or she is likely to depend primarily on government assistance, meaning for more than 50 percent of his or her income. The new rule would lower the threshold to receipt of government benefits totaling 15 percent of the poverty line in a given year."
2018-03-02,The Huffington Post,NRAs Top Lobbyist Implies Trump Is Back On Its Side,"The top lobbyist for the National Rifle Association hinted late Thursday that President Donald Trump had cooled on his own plans to support gun control measures.

Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRAs lobbying arm, said on Twitter he had a great meeting with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday and reaffirmed neither want gun control.

We all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people, Cox said after the meeting. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and dont want gun control.

The president himself followed up the note with a tweet saying he had a Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office with the group.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Friday that Trump promised the NRA he would continue to support the Second Amendment but that the background check system is something that hes still very much interested in improving.

Sanders didnt clarify what specific gun policies the president would support but said that conceptually, he still supports raising the age to 21 [for being able to purchase firearms]. But he also knows theres not a lot of broad support for that.

The move may signal that Trump has already taken an abrupt about-face from his own proposals to widely expand gun control legislation, including the adoption of more stringent background checks on some weapon purchases and the restriction of firearm purchase for some young people. The president first announced those plans in a surprising meeting with a group of lawmakers on Wednesday, which included his suggestion that law enforcement be able to seize guns from the mentally ill without first going to court.

I like taking the guns early, the president said. Take the guns first, go through due process second.

Trumps proposals were a vast departure from the stance taken by the NRA, which has long opposed any legislation meant to rein in access to firearms. Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, appeared delighted at the presidents suggestions.

You saw the president clearly saying not once, not twice, not three times, but like 10 times, that he wanted to see a strong universal background check bill, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said after the meeting, according to The New York Times. He didnt mince words about it. So I do not understand how then he could back away from that.

Its unclear how Trump now feels about such proposals after his meeting with the NRA. HuffPost has reached out to the White House for comment."
2018-11-10,The Huffington Post,Trump Snipes At Very Insulting Emmanuel Macron Comment As He Lands In Paris,"Macron made his call for a real European army in a French radio interview. We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia  and even the United States, he said, Agence France Press reported.

Europe had to be able to defend itself better alone, he said, the BBC reported.

Macron said Europe had to think about its own security as the U.S. becomes a less reliable ally.

He pointed to Trumps threat to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a 1987 arms control agreement with Russia that helped end the Cold War.

Macron said Europe and its security would be the main victim of such a move.

A French official insisted to CNN that Trump had taken Macrons words out of context. He also said that Macron himself would likely respond himself to the president Saturday.

The official said Macron was speaking about a military force that would supplement, rather than replace, NATO.

Macron and Trump were planning to meet on Saturday to discuss  European security, Syria and Iran, CBS News reported.

Macron also invited world leaders to participate in the Paris Peace Forum to discuss shared global challenges, according to The Washington Post. Trump is skipping that."
2018-03-19,The Huffington Post,Cynthia Nixon Announces Run For New York Governor,"Basically, it only affects families that earn between $75,000 and $125,000 a year, Nixon said on The View. And it doesnt apply to people who go part-time, which means they might have to work while theyre there, or they dont graduate in four years, or theyre Dreamers.

Nixon also wrote an op-ed for LoHud.com about public school funding that compared Cuomo, a Democrat, to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, a Donald Trump nominee.

[Cuomo] also wants to increase the number of privately-run charter schools in New York City by more than 50 percent, Nixon wrote. And he has been a loud proponent of private school tax credits, essentially a backdoor voucher system. These are policies we expect from Betsy DeVos, but from Andrew Cuomo?

The award-winning actress is looking to dethrone the two-term governor, who has been battling public transit issues and a federal investigation into his administrations payroll. Joseph Percoco, a former top aide to Cuomo, was found guilty in a corruption scandal after allegedly taking $300,000 in bribes from executives with state business.

A Siena College poll released Monday showed that despite the scandal, Cuomo leads Nixon with 66 percent of Democratic voters.

Clarification: A previous version of this story indicated Nixon poses a credible threat to Cuomo. This story has been updated to include details about a Monday poll that shows Cuomo significantly ahead of Nixon, as well as information about Percocos guilty verdict."
2018-11-21,The Huffington Post,Nancy Pelosi Critic Reverses Course Will Back Democratic Leader For Speaker,"Rep. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.), a critic of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), reversed course on Wednesday and announced his support for the Democratic leader to be speaker of the House.

Higgins was one of 16 Democrats who signed a letter earlier this month pledging not to support Pelosi for speaker. The Buffalo-area congressman said in June he would not back the Democratic minority leader, describing her at the time as aloof, frenetic and misguided.

On Wednesday, however, Higgins told The Buffalo News that he had decided to back Pelosi after she agreed to prioritize two of his main goals in the next Congress: infrastructure reform and allowing people to buy into Medicare at age 50.

I have an agreement in principle with the Democratic leader that those are going to be two priorities, and that I will be the lead person on the Medicare buy-in, Higgins said in the interview.

Some will ask why I have changed my position. The answer is simple: I took a principled stand .... A principled stand, however, often requires a pragmatic outlook in order to meet with success, Higgins said.

Pelosi, meanwhile, said in a statement that she is honored by Higgins support. She praised Higgins for leadership on the issue of achieving quality, affordable health care for all Americans.

What had seemed like a serious challenge to Pelosis second bid for the House gavel appears to be falling apart only two weeks since the November midterm elections, when Democrats picked up nearly 40 seats and reclaimed control of the House. Further hurting the anti-Pelosi effort is the lack of a viable alternative. Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) announced this week she would not challenge Pelosi for speaker.

Nancy Pelosi, when the history is written, will go down as one of the most effective legislative leaders that this countrys ever seen, Obama said, heaping praise on her work getting the Affordable Care Act passed in the House. Her stamina, her ability to see around corners, her ability to stand her ground and do hard things and to suffer unpopularity to get the right thing done I think stands up against any person that Ive observed or worked directly with in Washington during my lifetime."
2018-09-27,The Huffington Post,Donald Trump Postpones Meeting With Rod Rosenstein,"President Donald Trump has postponed his highly anticipated meeting with embattled Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until next week to avoid interfering with the Senate hearing on sexual assault allegations against his Supreme Court nominee.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders says the president spoke with Rosenstein a few minutes ago and they now plan to meet next week.

She said, They do not want to do anything to interfere with the hearing.

Rosensteins job is in question following reports he discussed possibly secretly recording the president and using the Constitutions 25th Amendment to remove him from office.

Trump says he has denied the reports.

Trump also said Wednesday hed certainly prefer not to fire Rosenstein, the Justice Departments No. 2 official who is overseeing the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling."

That question has a lot of inherent sexism in it. If any other political official had done what she has done, but had been male, that question would not constantly be coming up, she said, explaining that she would have to see who else was running.

The non-denominational pastor and community organizer, who peppers his remarks with the sayings of Shirley Chisholm and Abraham Joshua Heschel, is a vocal proponent of Medicare-for-all, debt-free college, universal pre-K, public campaign financing and protecting cities and states that choose not to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He is betting that the areas energized and growing contingent of people of color, millennials and progressives will help propel him to victory. A majority of the roughly 120,000 people in Allentown, from where he hails, are people of color, including 49 percent who are Latino.

A group backing Morganelli has attacked Edwards over the day care center that he ran and questions whether he mismanaged it financially, which Edwards vehemently denies. Other critics have wondered whether Edwards is viable in the general election. The districts population skews white outside Allentown and nearby Bethlehem and Easton, and has historically elected moderates from either party. Voters in all three counties in the district opted for Clinton over Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary.

A Pro-Trump Democrat Who Is Not Going To Reinvent Myself"
2018-11-02,The Huffington Post,Michael Cohen Claims Trump Called Black People Too Stupid To Vote For Him,"Donald Trumps former attorney is relating shocking racist and disparaging comments he says the president made about black people.

Michael Cohen tells Vanity Fair that the presidents recent tirades have compelled him to reveal details from his tenure at the Trump Organization that he says show Trumps real character.

Cohen says he once remarked to Trump that the crowd at a presidential campaign rally was overwhelmingly Caucasian and that Trump responded, Thats because black people are too stupid to vote for me.

He also claims that after the death of South African leader Nelson Mandela, Trump challenged him to name one country run by a black person thats not a shithole, before adding, Name one city.

But one of the most shocking allegations involved the first season of The Apprentice, which came down to two male contestants: eventual winner Bill Rancic and Kwame Jackson, an African-American investment manager who had graduated from Harvard Business School.

He said, Theres no way I can let this black f-g win, Cohen is quoted as saying in Vanity Fair.

Jackson confirmed he had heard that Trump made comments like that but replied to the magazine with a reference to Black Panther: My response to President Trump is simple and Wakandan. Not today, colonizer!

Cohen says he wishes he had been a bigger person and quit the Trump Organization but says he forgave his boss and figured hed grow into the presidency, something he now says hasnt happened.

Cohen pleaded guilty in August to illegally interfering in the 2016 election at Trumps direction. He admitted to eight criminal charges: five counts of tax evasion, two counts related to an illegal campaign contribution and one count of making a false statement."
2018-11-09,The Huffington Post,Even In Unwinnable Districts Local Democrats Are Celebrating Gains From The Blue Wave,"Georgias 9th District is one of the reddest in the country. No one thought McCall had a shot at winning. But across the country this cycle, political novices like McCall stepped up and ran for office or became involved in organizing in districts that the Democratic Party has traditionally written off.

We cant blame the people at the top if the people on the bottom arent working, McCall said. So one of the reasons I jumped in is because I thought, Why do Democrats always abandon districts like this? Then I had to tell myself honestly that its because Democrats like me in districts like this dont get out and work.

Maybe theyre talking to Republicans and independents and having conversations that short-term, may not come out ahead, but long-term will do more for the Democratic brand because there will be a person attached to the name of the party rather than just this idea, said Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, which recruits and supports Democrats running for down-ballot offices.

The 2016 elections were a shot in the arm for complacent Democrats. Groups like Indivisible, Swing Left and Run for Something popped up, driven by a bottom-up structure that focused on activism in local communities. People who werent involved in politics started looking for an outlet, with many of them reinvigorating Democratic organizations in their towns.

This is not something thats coming from the top down, he added. This is not the 50-state strategy. This is the people in the 50 states deciding theyre not going to wait for change from Washington  which rarely occurs  and theyre going to force change. Theyre going to do it their way. And I think its been great.

Kate Howard Franch, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party in Greenville, South Carolina, was also feeling good this week. She pointed out five new candidates who ran for the statehouse. All of them lost  but the fact that a diverse group of newcomers had decided to run was a big deal in that traditionally red area.

We saw a lot of people weve never seen before, and we had a number of people come in and say, I havent traditionally voted for Democrats, but Im going to this cycle. And not only that, they were coming in to get a yard sign for the governors race. ... The fact that they were willing to stake that in their yard was really impressive to us and says a lot about what is changing here, Franch said.

While having on-the-ground engagement is essential to win big races, having a strong candidate at the top of the ticket matters too. Texas was a key example. Rep. Beto ORourke (D) was always a long shot to win the Senate race. The national party wasnt going to invest its time and money there when it had so many other seats to defend. So ORourke looked to the grassroots.

King will be even more of an isolated pariah in Congress and in his party, with even less power over the next two years, he added. Republicans will either primary him to lance the festering, infected boil that is Steve King and/or now that we know the race can be closed, focused resources and attention will pour in that King wont be able to match. Im confident this is Steve Kings last win."
2018-09-11,The Huffington Post,As Hurricane Florence Nears Trump Calls Puerto Rico Response An Unsung Success,"President Donald Trump praised his administration on Tuesday for its controversial response to Hurricane Maria as the nation faces a new extreme weather threat in the form of Hurricane Florence.

I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible unsung success, the president said, once again commending emergency responders while shifting blame to local government.

Trump went so far to say that out of all the major storms to hit the U.S. last year, his administration did the best job directing response efforts on the U.S. island territory.

I think the hardest one that weve had so far is Puerto Rico, because of the island nature, Trump said after noting that supplies could not be driven there on trucks.

While the Trump administrations response to storms that hit Texas and the Southern U.S. coastline earned the president some good marks, Hurricane Maria was different.

Trump, then situated at Camp David, was widely criticized for a comparatively slow-moving effort to stem the humanitarian crisis caused by the hurricane. And although Puerto Rican authorities initially reported 64 official deaths linked to the storm, they raised the toll to 2,975 deaths in late August following independent analysis by researchers at George Washington University.

After Maria, Trump blamed Puerto Ricans for the islands financial crisis. On Tuesday, he exaggerated the state of the islands deteriorating power grid, saying Puerto Ricans had no electricity before the storm so that when the storm hit, that took it out entirely.

Trumps comments came during a FEMA briefing in the Oval Office on the approaching Hurricane Florence. The president told reporters that his administration is sparing no expense for the upcoming storm and that public safety is his highest priority.

Carmen Yulin Cruz  the San Juan mayor who repeatedly slammed Trump in the wake of Maria  criticized the president again on Tuesday.

Unfortunately, it seems he will never get it, she tweeted.

Trump simply does not get it. Thus his neglect towards Puerto Rico cost about 3,000 lives. Unfortunately, it seems he will never get it.  Carmen Yulin Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) September 11, 2018

North Carolina and Virginia will likely face the brunt of Hurricane Florence when it makes landfall later this week.

Were as ready as anybody has ever been, Trump said, adding that unlike Puerto Rico, the states in the path of Florence have very strong power companies."
2018-08-29,The Huffington Post,An Establishment Republican Hugs Trump And Wins In Arizona Primary,"Shes tried really hard to make herself over. Shes reinvented herself, from the flaming left liberal she was, McSally told a group of volunteers a few weeks before the election. Youre going to see that in the general election. Me in uniform, Sinema in a pink tutu.

The Sinema campaign has attempted to parry the attacks, noting the congresswomans support for veterans.

McSally, who previously represented a swing district based in Tucson for two terms, has spent heavily attacking Ward and winning over GOP primary voters with television ads tying herself to an unpopular president. Strategists in both parties believe McSallys political transformation may hamper her efforts to win swing voters in November. Sinema has focused on broadly popular issues for the general election, emphasizing her support for law enforcement and touting her political independence.

We love our country, were skeptical of our government, Sinema said of Arizona in one of her television ads. Im just not afraid to stand alone to do whats right."
2018-10-30,The Huffington Post,GOP Campaign Chief Condemns Steve King Over White Supremacist Rhetoric,"ASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) tweeted Tuesday to condemn Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) for his racist rhetoric.

A top House Republican on Tuesday condemned Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) for his racist rhetoric and behavior online, saying in a tweet that we must stand up to white supremacy and hate in all forms.

The tweet from Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) is notable because his job as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee is to elect Republicans to the House. The Ohio congressman is now the highest-ranking GOP official to condemn King, an eight-term congressman who has been expressing racist beliefs in increasingly undisguised terms.

Congressman Steve Kings recent comments, actions, and retweets are completely inappropriate. We must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior.  Steve Stivers (@RepSteveStivers) October 30, 2018

The reprimand from the NRCC head comes at an awkward time given that King faces a plausible challenge in his rural Iowa district this year. A new poll released this week showed the anti-immigration firebrand and President Donald Trump ally with a 1-point lead over Democratic challenger J.D. Scholten just a week before the midterm election.

These attacks are orchestrated by nasty, desperate and dishonest fake news, King said in a statement. Their ultimate goal is to flip the House and impeach Donald Trump. Establishment Never Trumpers are complicit.

Top Republicans, including Stivers, turned a blind eye toward King and his increasingly racist rhetoric for months. In August, for example, King gave a shocking interview with an Austrian far-right propaganda site in which he discussed his belief in the superiority of European culture over others and pushed various white nationalist talking points. He also endorsed Faith Goldy, Torontos white supremacist candidate for mayor, earlier this month.

When I reached out to Paul Ryans office after King endorsed Faith Goldy I was told that was a political question they wouldnt answer and was passed along to someone else (who never responded). This isnt uncommon. https://t.co/LTLtBwyjLC  Jane Coaston (@cjane87) October 30, 2018

King is also facing a growing backlash from the business community over his rhetoric. Dairy giant Land OLakes and technology corporation Intel became the latest companies to drop their support for the congressman this week.

2018-04-18,The Huffington Post,IRS Extends Tax Filing Deadline An Additional Day After Site Glitch,"The Internal Revenue Service is giving American taxpayers another day to file their taxes after a glitch temporarily shut down its online payment site on deadline day.

This is the busiest tax day of the year, and the IRS apologizes for the inconvenience this system issue caused for taxpayers, David Kautter, the agencys acting commissioner, said in a statement. The IRS appreciates everyones patience during this period. The extra time will help taxpayers affected by this situation.

Taxpayers were unable to make payments or view their tax records on the IRS website for hours on Tuesday due to technical difficulties, an agency spokesperson told NPR. Those individuals who went to the site hoping to file last-minute tax returns were greeted by a message with the heading Planned Outage: April 17, 2018 - December 31, 9999.

The error was resolved by Tuesday evening, but to make up for the interruption, the IRS announced it would allow people an additional day to file their income tax returns and to pay those taxes.

Everybody who had to file and pay by April 17 now has until midnight on April 18 to do so. The agency said taxpayers dont need to do anything to receive the extra day.

The IRS has experienced glitches in the past that have either delayed tax refunds or blocked the electronic filing of tax returns. But in recent years, the agency has only extended the filing deadline when legal holidays or weekends overlapped with April 15. This year the deadline had already been moved back two days to avoid Sunday and the District of Columbias observance of Emancipation Day on Monday."
2018-02-20,The Huffington Post,Dallas Politician Tells NRA To Get Lost Unless Its Ready To Talk Reform,"A gun-owning Dallas politician said he wont support the National Rifle Association holding its annual convention in his city this year after last weeks Florida school shooting unless the group will discuss gun law reform.

I have five guns, Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway said Monday. One in my car and one in every room in my house. But Im saddened that every time we turn around we have some type of gun violence. Gun violence. When you look at what is being done  its absolutely nothing.

Asking the NRA to reconsider Dallas for its convention is putting our citizens first, said Caraway, who emphasized his disdain for assault-style rifles like the one used by the Florida school killer. Who needs an AR-15 to go hunting? Who needs an AR-15 to protect their house?

Caraway zeroed in on President Donald Trumps focus on mental health in the massacre, instead of addressing gun control.

Yes, mental illness is an issue, but its not just an issue that should only be associated with guns, Caraway said. At the end of the day, we need to connect the dots. The NRA needs to step up to the plate and show leadership. Elected officials are receiving dollars from the NRA, and theyre afraid to set policy and to set necessary gun rules.

NRA campaign funding is a point raised in recent days by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunmans Feb. 14 rampage killed 17. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who holds an A+ rating from the NRA, received almost $10,000 from the group in the 2016 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you! Florida shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez said during a speech Saturday.

Children keep dying, added David Hogg, another Douglas student, because politicians refuse to take action and continue to take money from the special interest groups.

All money is not good money, Caraway said. Childrens lives, citizens lives and peoples lives are greater than any dollar amount.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, also incensed over last weeks horror, penned letters on Friday to Trump, as well as to Texas Sens. John Cornyn (R) and Ted Cruz (R), demanding that they work with Congress to create a commission on mass shootings."
2018-05-03,The Huffington Post,Tennessee Officials Are Trying To Get To The Bottom Of An Election Night Cyberattack,"Dick Moran, the countys top IT official, believes Knox County was the target of a denial-of-service attack in which actors with both domestic and foreign IP addresses deliberately flooded the countys servers with traffic to try and crash them. The county website displaying election results went down for about an hour as polls closed on Tuesday. The crash meant that people who went to check election results between 8 and 9 p.m. on election night received an error message, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. While the website was down, election officials printed out hard copies of the election results and gave them to reporters, WBIR, a local NBC affiliate, reported.

Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett (R) said on Wednesday that the crash didnt impact vote tallies or the integrity of the election, but that the county had hired a security firm to investigate the cause of the crash.

This is not something that should happen, he said in a statement. I want to know what happened, and I think an independent review will help to determine that so we can move forward and work to prevent similar issues in the future.

The attack comes amid increased scrutiny over the security of U.S. elections after the Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states last year that Russian hackers targeted their election systems during the 2016 presidential election. Some say the federal government hasnt moved quickly enough to address the severity of the threat. Responding to those concerns, Congress allocated $380 million to states in March to improve election security. DHS officials say they have improved communication and resource-sharing with state election officials.

We are aware of reports of a temporary outage affecting an election website in Knox County, Tenn. We have no information at this time that the outage was caused by a malicious actor, McConnell said in a statement. As is standard practice with any of our public or private critical infrastructure partners, we have offered our technical assistance and support to the county. We defer to the county to discuss any further details.

Without a forensic evaluation, theres no way for them to accurately conclude that the crash did not affect the vote tallies or the integrity of the election, she wrote in an email. We do not know if only the web servers were impacted by the attack or if a broader impact occurred. Its often the case that a DDOS attack is used as a distraction while another more insidious attack  such as on the tabulation servers  is occurring.

Hoke added that it was a positive sign that the county was bringing in a firm to analyze the incident, but wanted to know how thorough the analysis would be and whether the final report would be publicly available. She also said it was uncommon to see a denial of service attack on an election night, but expected them to increase this year because counties now store much more voter information online.

In an interview, Michael Grider, the Knox County director of communications, and David Ball, the countys deputy director of IT, disputed Hokes assessment that any votes could have been altered because the systems that tabulate the official votes are never connected to the internet or any computers that are. Ball said the county hadnt looked at the actual voting data from election night because there was no way someone could access the data. Theres no way that anyone couldve gotten into it, he said.

The issue that we had was one related to our web server. It was very simply an issue with how the election results were presented to the public, not how they were received in any official capacity, Grider said.

There is no network connection to the official results, nor to any of the voting machines at any point during the process or before and after the process. They have no network interface, Ball added.

Hoke said that she knew of several examples where system owners believed their networks to be entirely disconnected from the internet when they actually had some connectivity and suggested that the Knox County officials could have been more cautious in their statements.

Its wonderful to be able to espouse confidence as they are, but they should not be espousing such unless they have actually had their network for the [election management server] totally assessed by someone whose qualified in network architecture, she said."
2018-03-19,The Huffington Post,Republicans See No Need For Legislation To Protect Robert Mueller,"WASHINGTON  Republicans say they see no need to pass legislation to protect Robert Mueller, the head of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, despite fresh attacks from President Donald Trump against him over the weekend.

Trump took on the special counsel by name for the first time on Saturday, writing the next day on Twitter that his probe was not fair and stating falsely that it was staffed by all Democrats and no Republicans. The presidents attorney, John Dowd, later urged the Justice Department to immediately end the special counsel probe. Despite ensuing White House denials, Dowds statement and Trumps pointed attacks earlier in the day led many to speculate that Muellers job could be in peril.

Republicans over the weekend offered a mostly muted response to Trumps attacks against Mueller. A few, like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), warned that moving to terminate the special counsel would represent a red line and could even represent the end of Trumps presidency.

No Republican, however, called for a vote on long-stalled legislation meant to shield Mueller from firing. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a co-author of one such bill, tweeted Monday that the special counsel ought to be able to continue his investigation unimpeded.

Republican leaders, meanwhile, said they had no plans to intervene because they did not believe Trump would act against Mueller despite a slew of recent personnel shake-ups among government agencies and the firing of Andrew McCabe, who served as the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Friday.

I have urged the White House in public and private to allow Mueller to continue his investigation uninterrupted, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the Senate president pro tempore, said in a statement on Monday. I know Mueller well and believe him to be a straight shooter, and I continue to believe that giving Mueller the time and support necessary to get to the bottom of things is in the best interest of all parties involved.

My conversations with the White House have led me to believe legislation is not necessary at this point because I do not believe the president would take such a foolish action, Hatch added in the statement.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) was similarly dismissive of the possibility that Trump could fire Mueller, telling reporters on Monday he did not think the president would do so because the consequences would be so overwhelming.

The views of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) lined up with those of Republicans on Monday. She told reporters that she didnt think special protections were necessary since firing Mueller was so obviously a bad move, according to The Washington Posts Karoun Demirjian.

Feinstein clarified later that she believes Mueller is already protected under current regulations because Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has said there is no cause to fire him. The senator added, however, that she also supports legislation to codify those regulations.

Its not hard to envision Trump taking his attacks against Mueller to another level, however. The president has a reputation for impulsiveness, and on Monday the White House added a lawyer to its team who has pushed the theory on television that the FBI and Justice Department framed Trump.

Trump also surprised many members of his party earlier this month by announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  policies that have historically been opposed by free-trade conservatives. Many Republicans on Capitol Hill were unaware of the details surrounding the policy until after it was announced by Trump at the White House."
2018-11-06,The Huffington Post,For Democrats The Midterms Are About Health Care For Republicans Its Immigration,"Democratic voters are overwhelmingly focused on health care, according to HuffPost/YouGov polling taken throughout the summer and fall, while Republicans are most concerned with immigration. And those preferences closely mirror perceptions about what each partys candidates have focused on throughout the campaign.

What Americans say matters most has fluctuated modestly throughout the year, with health care and immigration both being top issues. Concerns about immigration peaked during the debate over family separations in the summer and again in October as the president ramped up anti-immigration rhetoric during the closing days before the election. The share of voters who named the Supreme Court as a top issue dropped by half between a poll ending Oct. 2 and a subsequent one ending Oct. 23 (Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed between the two).

In the most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, 35 percent of voters named health care as among the issues most important to them, and 34 percent named immigration. The economy, at 26 percent, took third place, followed by gun policies at 15 percent, social issues at 11 percent, and both the Supreme Court and the way things work in Washington at 10 percent. Seven other topics polled in single digits: the environment, Donald Trumps record as president, Trumps personality and character, tax reform, voting rights, foreign policy and infrastructure.

But results were sharply polarized. In the final survey before Election Day, 48 percent of voters who described themselves as Democrats or leaning toward the Democratic Party named health care as one of the two issues most important to them. Nothing else came remotely close  the next two issues, gun policies and the environment, scored just 16 percent each. Republican and Republican-leaning voters showed a similar gulf between their top concern and everything else: 60 percent named immigration as among their top issues, with 38 percent picking the economy and fewer than a quarter naming anything else.

The midterms, as President Trump has acknowledged, will serve to some degree as a referendum on him personally  and other polling has found that hes taking up far more space in voters minds than Barack Obama did in 2014. But 39 percent of voters said they wished candidates were talking less about Trumps personality and character, far outpacing the percentages of those who were tired of hearing about any other issue.

Fully half of Democrats campaign ads have been about health care, according to one analysis. Another look at ad spending found that health care was the most commonly mentioned topic in 45 percent of local media markets and that 1 in 5 Republican ads have mentioned immigration. The polling data show a voting public thats fairly tuned in with both parties messaging. Very few, for instance, have the impression that the Republicans are campaigning on the environment or that Democrats are focusing on tax reform.

In the final HuffPost/YouGov survey, about half of voters said theyd heard Democratic candidates in their state mentioning health care within the past week. Some 38 percent named it as among the partys top issues, putting it substantially ahead of messaging on Trump or anything else.

Any survey aiming to measure voters top concerns deserves a couple of caveats. For one thing, it matters how pollsters ask the questions and what options they provide. The HuffPost/YouGov survey, for instance, splits up Trumps behavior and his record into separate categories. Other pollsters have found somewhat different results, although focused on the same three issues: SurveyMonkey, which asks Americans to choose among seven issues including terrorism and education, has found economic concerns largely dominating the midterms, with health care a close second and immigration lagging behind. The Ipsos/Reuters tracking poll and Gallups polling have both found health care, the economy and immigration forming a triumvirate of top concerns.

For another thing, what people mean when they talk about an issue is complicated. The Kaiser Family Foundation, which polls extensively on health care, notes that voters who cite it as a priority can be referencing anything from worries about health care costs to a desire for universal coverage to a wish to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And lastly, people simply arent always that good at identifying the many factors that influence their ultimate decision to pick one candidate over another.

But what voters say they care most about, and how well they believe the parties are reflecting their priorities, can shed light on an elections dynamics. A HuffPost/YouGov poll taken just before Republicans win in the 2014 midterms, for instance, found that voters saw the GOP as sharing their concerns about the economy and Democrats as more focused on social issues.

This year, the question of how well either party is reflecting voters priorities is something of a wash. In the final HuffPost/YouGov survey of the race, voters are split 44 percent to 46 percent on whether or not Republicans in their state are doing well at addressing the issues and topics they care about. Theyre divided by a nearly identical 44 percent to 47 percent on whether or not the Democrats are doing well.

2018-05-08,The Huffington Post,This Trump Country House District Just Became A Key Progressive Battleground,"The progressives now have the opportunity to show that an unabashedly liberal platform is as much of a political winner in rural and suburban GOP strongholds as it is in the biggest, blue-state cities.

Liz Watson is running on a bold agenda and a record of experience actually crafting policy that is making a difference in the lives of working families, said Joe Dinkin, spokesman for the Working Families Party, which endorsed her. She is going to prove that that is the way to win in a Republican district.

Watson, a lawyer, defeated left-wing civil rights attorney Dan Canon and Rob Chatlos, owner of a small trucking company, in the Democratic primary. She now takes on Republican Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, a freshman lawmaker and son of a multi-millionaire real estate tycoon, in the general election.

Hollingsworth, who moved to Indiana from Tennessee in 2015 and subsequently self-funded his 2016 run, significantly underperformed Trump in the district. Hollingsworth won his seat by just under 14 percentage points, while Trump carried the district by 27 points.

The district, which stretches from liberal Bloomington in the north to the Louisville, Kentucky, suburbs in the south, has a not-too-distant history of electing Democrats. Baron Hill, a moderate Democrat, won it in 1998, 2000 and 2002. After losing re-election in 2004, he regained the seat in the 2006 vote, but then was ousted in the 2010 Tea Party wave.

[Watson's win] will give southwestern Indiana voters the sort of clear choice they may not have been afforded by blander Democrats in the recent past.

Whether a patchwork of liberal academics and college students, Louisville-area suburbanites, union members and communities of color can propel a Democrat as progressive as Watson in what became Trump country will be one of the 2018 elections more interesting questions.

The contrast between Watsons egalitarian platform and Hollingsworths commitment to ensuring kids born rich have the best possible chance to achieve all of their dreams will give southwestern Indiana voters the sort of clear choice they may not have been afforded by blander Democrats in the recent past, said Jeff Hauser, a former political strategist at the AFL-CIO who now runs the Center for Economic and Policy Researchs Revolving Door Project.

Watson, 43, returned to her hometown of Bloomington to run for office after years of progressive lawyering in Washington. Most recently, Watson served as labor policy director for Democrats in the House, where she helped craft $15-an-hour minimum wage legislation.

In a previous role as the director of workplace justice at the National Womens Law Center, she worked closely with groups like the Working Families Party to pass Marylands paid family leave and gender pay equity laws.

One thing that distinguishes Watson as a pretty unique candidate is not just having the progressive platform, but that shes had a career of experience designing policy that affects peoples lives, Dinkin said.

Watsons platform resembles that of a progressive running in a safe Democratic seat. She supports Medicare for all, protecting Social Security and empowering Medicare to bargain with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices. Watson also wants the federal government to remove marijuana from its list of the most dangerous illicit substances, and protect states rights to legalize cannabis.

Her progressive stances have won her the backing of most local labor unions and elected officials, as well as national groups like the Working Families Party, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee."
2018-10-11,The Huffington Post,If Republicans Keep The House This Might Be The Reason Why,"WASHINGTON  Democrats are increasingly confident theyll take back the House after the midterm elections. But if the politicians and pundits are wrong, there may be one simple reason why: gerrymandering.

Gerrymandering is nothing new. Drawing politically advantageous district lines has been a staple of American politics for more than 200 years, even before then-Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry approved a new district for the state Senate in 1812 that resembled a salamander. (We got the word gerrymander by mashing together Gerrys last name and salamander.)

But gerrymandering is getting more sophisticated, as mapmakers get more ambitious with the number of seats they target, as the districts they draw get more ridiculous-looking, and as the technology they use gets better.

On the new midterm podcast The Wave, I spoke with David Daley, author of Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesnt Count, and Dave Wasserman, the House political editor of The Cook Political Report, about gerrymandering and how it could prevent Democrats from taking back the House.

In Ratf**ked, Daley lays out how Republicans targeted state legislatures in 2010 with the aim of redrawing the congressional seats and creating a red firewall that could withstand demographic shifts and make it much more difficult for Democrats to hold the House of Representatives. Remarkably, for the bargain price of around $30 million, Republicans were able to flip 20 state chambers from Democratic to Republican in 2010, giving the GOP control of both the upper and lower houses in 25 states.

They have been the red firewall that have held back blue waves all decade, Daley told me. In 2012, when Democrats get 1.4 million more votes for the U.S. House, Republicans hold a 234-201 advantage in the chamber nevertheless.

Wasserman estimates that Republicans hold only about a half-dozen to a dozen more seats than they would under nonpartisan maps. Democrats do need to beat Republicans by a significant margin in the combined nationwide popular vote to retake the House, but to Wasserman, that is largely due to geography. Democrats are increasingly living in cities, while Republicans are taking up more room in the country.

Wasserman recounted a challenge he issued to his Twitter followers to draw up districts that would give Democrats a major advantage in Wisconsin, which has an even Cook Partisan Voting Index rating. (That means it closely resembles the partisan makeup of the nation as whole). Wasserman offered $7,000 to anyone who could produce a map where six of the eight congressional districts rated 8 points more Democratic.

Wasserman himself was easily able to draw a map where six of the eight district rated 7 points more Republican, but no one was able to claim the money  likely because the task is impossible.

According to Wasserman, yes, the number of vulnerable swing districts is declining. The Cook Political Report calculated that the number of swing districts has declined from 164 in 1997 to 72 in 2018. But again, Wasserman sees this more as a consequence of natural political dynamics and geography. According to that study, the reduction in the number of swing districts was only 17 percent in redistricting years, meaning 83 percent of it was just natural shifts in other years.

Still, even Wasserman recognizes that Republicans have some seats because of gerrymandering, and the effect of those safer seats also means Republicans have more money to pour into other, more vulnerable races.

So with Democrats expected to pick up at least around 15 seats, a Republican majority that hangs on to the House would only be in the single digits, meaning even by the most bearish accounts for Democrats, a GOP majority would have those mapmakers to thank."
2018-07-19,The Huffington Post,Fossil Fuel Industries Outspend Clean Energy Advocates On Climate Lobbying By 10 To 1,"George Frey via Getty Images Emissions rise out of three large smokestacks at Pacificorp's coal-fired power plant in Castle Dale, Utah, last October.

We seem to have a public opinion fetish where if we get public opinion to be supportive of climate change legislation, then itll happen, Brulle said. My answer to that is, gee, well, we should have gun control legislation then.

During the period examined by the study, expenditures on federal lobbying aimed at climate issues topped $2 billion, representing on average 3.9 percent of annual federal lobbying dollars. That spending fluctuated by year. In 2009, it surged to more than 9 percent of the total as Congress debated the American Clean Energy and Security Act, which would have established a cap-and-trade market to limit greenhouse gas emissions and allow companies to buy and sell permits to pollute. The bill failed in the Senate in 2010.

To conduct the analysis, Brulle downloaded nearly 2 million publicly available lobbying files collected by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Searching for a dozen key terms  including climate change, global warming and carbon  he pinpointed more than 64,100 reports of such lobbying, identified the reports by business sector, and compared those figures to the sectors annual overall spending on lobbying.

That $2 billion total represents a conservative estimate of industry spending to sway lawmakers on climate issues. Federal disclosure rules only require reports from people who are paid to lobby on behalf of a client, make more than one contact with government officials working on a bill and spend more than 20 percent of their time on lobbying activities. Many other representatives of major corporate interests lobby the government but keep it under 20 percent of their time. The total also does not cover activities such as mobilizing outside groups, getting op-eds published in media outlets or directing public relations campaigns that may shape legislation.

The climate change denial movement remains powerful if splintered. Oil giants traditionally funded the network of misinformation outlets seeding doubt about the role of fossil fuels in warming the planet. But in recent years, right-wing ideologues, such as the billionaire hedge funders of the Mercer family and the industrialist Koch brothers have become the movements chief financiers.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas sectors top lobbying group, noted the studys finding that the fossil fuel industry spent nearly 18 percent of all climate lobbying dollars during the period examined, but suggested it wasnt the whole story. In a statement, spokesman Reid Porter said the industry also invests more in the development and deployment of greenhouse gas reducing technologies.

The Sierra Club, which made up part of the 2.3 percent sliver of climate lobbying dollars that came from environmental groups, blamed the unlimited money fossil fuel polluters have poured into our political system for making the debate on the climate crisis in the United States ... radically different than in every other country on earth. To try to counter that disparity in lobbying dollars, legislative director Melinda Pierce said the nonprofit mobilizes more than three million members and supporters.

Brulle suggested that climate advocates could exploit differences between industry sectors that have historically opposed climate legislation as a way to disrupt their lobbying power. Utilities that generate a larger portion of energy from natural gas or renewable power were more likely to lobby in favor of climate legislation, he said, than their coal-powered competitors.

A 2017 paper from Australian National University researcher Christian Downie laid out a strategy that included building coalitions among renewable energy players, exploiting inter-industry divisions by targeting politically weak industries that are less able to mount a resistance campaign, and exploiting intra-industry divisions by seeking to bring on board outliers that support policies that the rest of an industry opposes.

The Trump administration has little use for efforts to fight climate change. The EPA under then-Administrator Scott Pruitt started the process to repeal the Clean Power Plan, a federal rule that would have incentivized utilities to use more renewable energy and scale back emissions from coal. It also moved to gut a regulation that would have raised the fuel efficiency of vehicles, now the countrys biggest source of greenhouse gas pollution, at the behest of auto manufacturers who publicly claim to support climate action. Theres little reason to believe Andrew Wheeler, the new EPA chief and a former coal and mining lobbyist, will shift gears.

Legislation ambitious enough to make a difference at a time when fossil fuel emissions are hitting an all-time high and climate change appears to be happening faster and more intensely than previously thought faces yet another hurdle. The false belief that scientists are not yet certain about humanitys role in global warming all but dominates the Republican Party and undergirds the Trump administrations environmental, national security and energy policies. Meanwhile, Democrats have failed to rally around a bold climate plan, instead intermittently producing legislation to set renewable energy goals with no clear roadmap on how to achieve them. Even the most purportedly hawkish Democrats on climate change have proposed conservative policies to deal with it, including a carbon tax that would have lowered the corporate tax rate by 6 percent and a cap-and-dividend bill that would have returned carbon revenues to Americans in the form of a rebate.

An insurgent group of progressive candidates running in the 2018 midterm elections could shift the debate within Democratic policy circles. Some House candidates  including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Randy Bryce of Wisconsin and Kaniela Ing of Hawaii  are calling for a Green New Deal, a massive government spending plan to build up renewable energy production and create potentially millions of federally backed middle-class jobs. Some left-leaning think tanks are also drafting proposals to nationalize and dismantle publicly traded fossil fuel giants."
2018-08-03,The Huffington Post,Once Again Intelligence Agencies Say Russia Is Targeting US Elections Right Now,"Russia is waging a pervasive campaign to undermine democracy and divide the United States, several of the nations top intelligence officials said Thursday in their latest castigation of the Kremlin.

As I have said consistently: Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day, Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, said at a White House press briefing on Thursday. This is a threat we need to take extremely seriously, and to tackle and respond to with fierce determination and focus.

The comments come just weeks after President Donald Trump met in private with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and then undermined the assessment of his intelligence chiefs, saying he believed Putin when he told him its not Russia behind the efforts to interfere in the 2016 election.

Trump later walked back those statements amid widespread criticism, saying he accepted the conclusion that Russias meddling in the 2016 election took place, adding a caveat that it could be other people also.

What we see is the Russians are looking for every opportunity, regardless of party, regardless of whether or not it applies to the election, to continue their pervasive efforts to undermine our fundamental values, Coats said Thursday.

Intelligence officials and lawmakers have been warning about efforts to influence elections as soon as the November midterms and into the next presidential election. Facebook this week also said it had deleted more than a dozen pages and profiles linked to bad actors linked to Russia-backed accounts from the last election.

During the briefing, which was also attended by Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, national security adviser John Bolton and National Security Agency chief Paul Nakasone, officials said Trump had specifically directed us to make the matter of election meddling and securing our election process a top priority.

Our democracy itself is in the crosshairs, Nielsen said. Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and it has become clear that they are the target of our adversaries, who seek ... to sow discord and undermine our way of life.

The intelligence community has been very active on this, the Department of Homeland Security has been active on this, he told CNN. While the president has been inconsistent in his tweets, and some of the messaging that hes put on it, hes the only one in the government that hasnt been paying attention to this.

Several lawmakers have already gone public to say they have been the subject of hacking attempts akin to those on the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said aides in her office had received phishing emails in recent days and that members of both parties were being targeted.

Were hearing that this is widespread ... with political parties across the country, as well as with members of the Senate, she said.

Russia has used numerous ways in which they want to influence through media  social media, through bots, through actors that they hire through proxies, Coats said of the ongoing attacks. All of the above and potentially more. I cant go into any deep, deep details on what is classified. But it is pervasive. It is ongoing with the intent to achieve their intent, and that is to drive a wedge and undermine our democratic values."
2018-04-28,The Huffington Post,FIFA Cites Ethics Rules After Trumps Threatening World Cup Tweet,"U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted a threat to countries opposing North Americas bid to host the 2026 World Cup  and the global soccer organization FIFA promptly pointed to ethics rules prohibiting any nation from wielding undue influence.

The U.S. has presented a joint bid with Mexico and Canada for the right to host the worlds biggest sporting event. Morocco has issued a competing bid. The North American proposal has hit stiff resistance because of Trumps travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations, the perception that the U.S. is increasingly hostile to foreigners, and resentment over Trumps reported reference to Haiti and African nations last year as shithole countries.

The World Cup host will be announced on June 13 after a vote by all FIFA member nations.

On Thursday, Trump touted Americas strong bid to host the event  and appeared to threaten that the U.S. might withdraw support from countries that lobby against it.

The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they dont support us (including at the United Nations)?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2018

Several European nations  including Russia, France and Belgium  have already announced their support for Morocco. The country will also be backed by other African nations, which hold a significant percentage of FIFA votes, according to ESPN. Morocco also has the backing of several South American and Asian nations. In addition, the governments of the Caribbean nations St. Lucia and Dominica have pledged support for Morocco.

FIFA issued a statement to Reuters saying that while it cannot comment on specific remarks about the World Cup, it pointed to its rules of conduct, which prohibit governments from interfering in national soccer federations and from exerting undue influence on the selection of the World Cup host.

FIFAs bidding regulations also specifically prohibit anyone affiliated with a bid from making any written or oral statements of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, in relation to the bids of other member associations.

The rules also instruct member associations to reject any attempt to be influenced in relation to their function and obligations as voters.

The North American bid so far has the support of 16 voting nations in South and Central America, as well as Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. wont be playing in the World Cup competition in Russia this summer because its mens team wasnt strong enough to advance.

Being schooled on ethics by FIFA marks a surprising low. The organization was hit with a host of U.S. indictments in 2015 on several charges, including tax dodging and bribery for marketing contracts and World Cup votes."
2018-05-23,The Huffington Post,Tulsi Gabbards Syria Views Cost Her Support Of Hawaii Teachers Union,"She was one of just three representatives, and the only Democrat who refused to condemn Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assads genocidal chemical attack on his own people. After the attack, Gabbard traveled to Syria to meet with the genocidal dictator al-Assad without permission from the White House or Congress. Her trip was funded by a group with ties to al-Assad supporters and she only covered the expenses herself after the news media reported who paid for her trip.

Then, after al-Assad bombed his people again, Gabbard continued to refuse to admit the attack had occurred. At the same time, she voted to practically ban Syrian refugees from coming into the United States after the Paris terrorist attacks, even though Syrian refugees were not involved in the attacks."
2018-03-28,The Huffington Post,Spoof Craigslist Ad Seeks Lawyer For Donald Trump And Its Hilarious,"President Donald Trumps struggle to find lawyers to represent him is well documented.

So on Tuesday, a cheeky prankster attempted to give Trump a helping hand by posting a spoof job ad on Craigslist.

The listing on the websites District of Columbia jobs thread seeks a lead attorney to represent a difficult client at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who is involved in an ongoing Federal investigation.

Working knowledge of social media, especially Twitter is a plus, as is a better than average knowledge of the adult film industry and a collection of Playboy magazines from 1985-2010, the ad notes.

Prior appearances on Fox News would also be a huge plus.

Applicants must be prepared to work with a client who is very forceful and opinionated about his defense and who is his own best counsel, the listing adds. Basically your job boils down to keeping him from testifying under oath and hoping the rest comes out in the wash.

Its unclear who created the ad. They did not respond immediately to HuffPosts request for comment. The listing has, however, been well-received on Twitter:

OMG! This Craigslist ad for Trump's new lead attorney is an example of epic trolling!  https://t.co/YHN9YXrQqq  Eric Rosswood (@LGBT_Activist) March 27, 2018

2018-11-05,The Huffington Post,That Racist Trump Ad CNN Refused To Air NBC Just Ran It In Prime Time,"The anti-immigration ad, which the president first shared last Wednesday, aired about two hours into the broadcast of Sundays game between the New England Patriots and the Green Bay Packers.

The company was widely lambasted for airing it. On Monday morning, an NBC Universal spokesperson said the company recognizes the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible, according to a tweet from NBC News media reporter Dylan Byers.

The clip has sought to whip up voters fears of the Central American migrant caravan ahead of Tuesdays midterm elections. The 30-second spot includes footage of Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican citizen who killed two police officers in 2014, and likens his behavior to members of the caravan. The video then urges viewers to vote Republican before a voiceover from the president says he approves the message.

The spot has been roundly criticized and CNN made headlines after the network refused to air it, saying it was blatantly racist. Donald Trump Jr., the presidents son, had criticized the network earlier for turning the ad down, saying CNN would only run fake news and wont talk about real threats.

When presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined, CNN PR tweeted back at Trump Jr. Those are the facts.

NBC didnt appear to have the same hesitations, and people around the country took to social media to voice their frustrations that the network would accept money to air the advertisement despite its message.

So @nbc and @Comcast aired that racist Trump caravan commercial during the football game. Who made that decision? How did they decide it was ok? I am disgusted that you would air that after @cnn refused to air it because it is explicitly racist. Shame on you. @NBCNews  Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) November 5, 2018

Some have pointed to an NBC statement from 2015 in which the network cut ties with Trump over his controversial remarks on immigration. The company said at the time that it would no longer broadcast the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants, saying respect and dignity for all people are cornerstone of our values.

Trump has continued to target media outlets at recent campaign rallies and moved to politicize those in the migrant caravan. The group, many fleeing violence in Honduras, has been traveling on foot and are still several weeks away from Americas southern border.

Still, the president has defaulted toward fear-mongering ahead of the midterms and last week sent more than 5,200 troops to the region."

Im beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot. (Although power imbalances  and the ability to abuse them  do exist even when the sex has been consensual.)

Lewinsky, who has mostly avoided the spotlight since the scandal, explained her decision to be featured in the A&E docuseries in another Vanity Fair essay published this week.

Why did I choose to participate in this docuseries? One main reason: because I could, she wrote. Throughout history, women have been traduced and silenced. Now, its our time to tell our own stories in our own words."

While dropping one of her audiotapes on Mondays The View, Manigault Newman said she thinks a rumored racial slur tape, featuring Trump using the n-word during the making of The Apprentice, not only exists but will be released before the midterm elections.

Several people associated with the Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice series have said they heard Trump use racist or other offensive language, but no one has provided concrete evidence.

Former Apprentice producer Bill Pruitt tweeted in 2016 that such tapes exist, but in subsequent posts admitted he doesnt know where.

As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse. #justthebegininng  Bill Pruitt (@billpruitt) October 8, 2016

In Mondays interview, Manigault Newman also introduced new audio that shed recorded while sitting in on meetings with the president and other White House staff last year. In this tape, Trump rants that Hillary Clinton is getting killed now with Russia and that the real Russia story is Hillary and collusion.

Basically the new tape amounts to the president saying something ridiculous and unfounded. Not unlike his daily tweets.

On @TheView, @OMAROSA releases secretly recorded Oct '17 tape of Trump ranting during White House meeting about how ""the real Russia story is Hillary & collusion""

Thousands of students, teachers and activists hit the pavement in Washington, D.C., and in hundreds of cities across the country on Saturday all for one cause: gun reform.

A lone gunman stormed the halls of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and took the lives of 17 people in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14. Student survivors of that massacre are no longer telling their stories to local media and grieving quietly. They are taking a stand to tell the world that enough is enough with Americas gun problem.

March For Our Lives is not only about changing our gun laws, its an effort to keep children alive so they can become adults who are catalysts for change.

Luckily, many celebrities have been using their platforms to support and spread the word about the march.

Taylor Swift posted on Instagram Friday that she would be making a donation to the march to show my support for the students, for the March for Our Lives campaign, for everyone affected by these tragedies, and to support gun reform. Pop musician Lady Gaga said she was sponsoring a bus heading from Harlem to DC for the event.

Comedian Amy Schumer showed her support by saying she was marching for Mayci Breaux and Jillian Johnson, two women who were killed when a gunman entered a Lafayette, Louisiana, movie theater during a showing of Schumers movie Trainwreck."
2018-08-27,The Huffington Post,This Pious Crap From A George W Bush Flunky Is A Perfect Tribute To John McCain,"Heres a smarmy tweet from Matthew Dowd, who was a strategist for former President George W. Bush and who now serves as a political analyst for ABC News:

The tweet is referencing the White Houses decision to return its flag to full staff just two days after the death of Sen. John McCain (it would later take the flag back to half staff). The flag business had set off a great pious harrumphing among establishment types, liberal and conservative alike. Jake Tapper alone did so much garment-rending that for a minute I thought hed have to host todays show wearing nothing but a big yellow ribbon over his crotch.

And here was Dowds contribution to the discourse: a photo probably pulled off Google Images, where a version of it has been indexed via the website of South Carolina state Rep. Bill Hixon. Its not hard to see why Dowd chose this particular shot. It hits all the proper elegiac notes: the flag, the soldier, the salute, the dying sun of some alien desert.

But the thing about this photo is that its a fake. The original was photoshopped to drop the flag to half staff.

The real photo can be seen here. It was taken in southern Iraq by Marine Sgt. Tisha L. Carter-Valrie. The soldier in the photo is her husband and fellow Marine sergeant, James E. Valrie, who died in 2009 after a bout with kidney cancer. The date was April 3, 2003, two weeks into a catastrophic war of which McCain was an enthusiastic salesman. The photo was quickly pressed into service of its own. The USAA put it on a postcard. KISS put it on their website. A Marine had it tattooed on his forearm.

Unfortunately, with all the wonderful ways it has been used, Carter-Valrie wrote in the Los Angeles Times on the 10th anniversary of the war, the photograph has also been manipulated and in some cases used in ways I found disrespectful. People flipped it so the flag flies in the other direction  but by doing that, Carter-Valrie pointed out, it makes my husband look like he is saluting with the wrong hand. Nor did she like the version, spotted on an anti-war website, in which the flag was turned upside down. Nor did she like the version, sometimes disseminated on Memorial Day, in which the flag was moved to appear at half staff.

That was the photo Dowd came across and circulated. People seem to like it. By 3 p.m., it had been retweeted more than 2,000 times. Carter-Valrie would not be happy if she saw it, I dont think, but thats a minor consideration when there are postures to be struck. And maybe in its fraudulence, the photoshopped image serves some larger truth. What a perfect tribute, after all  to McCain, to the war he and Dowds old boss wanted so badly, to the establishment ghouls who helped them sell it. A glib and phony artifact from a war sold on glib and phony pretenses."
2018-08-23,The Huffington Post,Its Time To Decriminalize Immigration Say Top Texas Dems,"That simple legal reform would have massive repercussions, upending the zero tolerance policy that the Trump administration used to split up families at the border. It would still allow the Department of Homeland Security to charge unauthorized immigrants with civil violations, but it would save the government billions in incarceration costs and allow federal prosecutors to spend more time fighting non-immigration crimes. And it would be logistically simpler than abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the idea currently in vogue on the left wing of the Democratic Party.

U.S. Border Patrol agents ask a group of Central American asylum-seekers to remove hair bands and wedding rings before taking them into custody on June 12, 2018, near McAllen, Texas. The immigrant families were then sent to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing center for possible prosecution under the Trump administration's now-abandoned family separation policy.

The idea isnt unprecedented. The law criminalizing unauthorized border crossings dates from 1929 when it was first proposed by U.S. Sen. Coleman Blease, a South Carolina segregationist known for celebrating the lynchings of black men with a ritual dance. But for most of its life, Bleases law, which was later incorporated into the Immigration and Nationality Act, was rarely used. In fact, until the George W. Bush administration, the U.S. government charged the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants with civil violations, not federal crimes. Treating unauthorized crossing as a civil violation allowed the government to deport unauthorized immigrants without spending huge sums on prosecuting and jailing migrants that U.S. officials planned to deport anyway.

Then, in 2005, officials in the border sector of Del Rio, Texas, ran out of bed space in their civil detention centers. They decided to start using the law criminalizing illegal entry to prosecute immigrants in criminal court. The idea caught on in other border sectors, and within a few years, the government was prosecuting and jailing tens of thousands of migrants annually.

The Trump administration used the same law to enact its family separation policy. By prosecuting the parents of families crossing the border together, the Trump administration effectively forced the children into shelters and the mothers and fathers into federal jails. Today, immigration prosecutions take up roughly half the federal criminal docket, costing the government roughly a billion dollars a year in added incarceration expenses, according to a 2012 estimate by Austin-based advocacy group Grassroots Leadership.

Valdez recalled that when she was serving as Dallas County Sheriff, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials would sometimes describe unauthorized immigrants as criminals on the basis of federal immigration convictions alone. Although that classification is accurate under U.S. law, those convictions didnt make the person more of a public threat, she argued.

Its time to reform and look at things, said Valdez, who is also a former Customs agent. The majority of people are not coming in to do harm. ... We still have to have some kind of checking and verifying, but I dont think coming in here undocumented should be a criminal issue.

ORourke, who has mounted a competitive campaign to oust Republican Sen. Ted Cruz from his seat, offered more cautious remarks, focusing primarily on the tens of thousands of mostly Central American asylum-seekers who have crossed into the U.S. in recent years. The Trump administration has repeatedly turned away migrant families seeking to enter the U.S. at legal ports of entry, ORourke noted.

These asylum-seekers  penniless, at wits end, after surviving three weeks on the road, very often with their children  then attempt to do what I think any human would do, which is to request asylum in between the ports of entry, ORourke said. We should not criminalize that.



Escobar said she arrived at the conclusion that immigration violations should be decriminalized from a human rights perspective. But she urged her critics to consider the high costs of prosecuting and imprisoning immigrants, on top of detaining and deporting them.

The comments from leading Texas Democrats come as progressives are reimagining the immigration enforcement system in the face of the most hardline administration in recent memory. The boldest and most controversial proposal to date, first argued in the pages of The Nation by Sean McElwee, is to abolish ICE entirely.

Under current law, jumping the border the first time is misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in prison. Subsequent offenses can carry jail sentences up to 20 years, depending on the persons criminal record. When ICE detains or deports an unauthorized immigrant, the agency is generally carrying out civil law rather than punishing someone for a crime."
2018-04-22,The Huffington Post,NYT Reporter Hits Back At Trump Says She Knows Who The DrunkDrugged-Up Loser Is,"New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted on Saturday that a source quoted in her story derided by Donald Trump as a drunk/drugged up loser is likely former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg.

A story by Haberman and two other Times reporters on Friday examined the likelihood that the presidents attorney Michael Cohen will turn on his boss now that he is being investigated. It quoted two biographers, Nunberg and Trumps long-time controversial informal adviser Roger Stone. (Stone was quoted as saying that Trump goes out of his way to treat Cohen like garbage. Nunberg said Cohen has leverage on Trump and should maximize it now.)

Trump, infuriated by the story, slammed third-rate- flunkie Haberman in vicious tweets Saturday morning, and added the scathing drugged up insult about one of the sources, whom he didnt name.

It had to be Nunberg, Haberman tweeted, because the president is too afraid of bombastic, rule-breaking Stone to be that direct.

Both men have denied that Trump was referring to them. Not a reference to me, Stone told The Palm Beach Post. Nunberg told CNN: I have no idea who POTUS is talking about, so I have no response.

....non-existent sources and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked & respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if....  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2018

Haberman slammed Trumps use of drugged up as showing little compassion for those struggling with drug problems, such as victims of the opioid crisis. She then named Nunberg as the target of Trumps vicious dig.

A few things - Trump is referring to @NunbergSam in his tweet. Hes too aware of what Stone could do to him to be that direct. Also, Trump has been abusive to all his staffers at various points, but continues to greet @CLewandowski_ better than most https://t.co/coxNMRVCUl  Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 21, 2018

Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York who was fired by Trump, responded to Habermans tweet, asking: Donald Trump is afraid of Roger Stone?

Haberman also added a bit of new information from her reporting, revealing that one source told her that Trump is abusive to everyone.

The Times followed up with a story Saturday acknowledging Trumps criticism of the article, including his tweet that the newspaper was going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will flip. The president also accused the Times of using nonexistent sources.

Times executive editor Dean Baquet said in a statement that the story is filled with named quotes on the record, and everything Maggie has reported from inside the White House has proven true.

Nunberg was subpoenaed last month to appear before a federal grand jury investigating Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. He initially vowed to defy the subpoena and appeared on a series of news shows sounding dangerously defiant. At one point, CNNs Erin Burnett told him she smelled alcohol on his breath. Nunberg denied that he had been drinking, but added that he had taken anti-depressants that day.

Nunberg said the following day that he planned to comply with the order and would appear before the grand jury by the end of the week.

Roger Stone is being investigated for possible ties to Russia hackers and talks with Wikileaks during the presidential campaign. On Friday he called the late Barbara Bush a vindictive drunk, and was promptly disinvited from speaking at an upcoming Florida GOP event."
2018-06-12,The Huffington Post,Trump Says North Korea Summit Agreement Is Far More Comprehensive Than It Actually Is,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters on Monday that the complete and verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept from Pyongyang.

Tuesdays agreement included a commitment by Kim to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the terms verifiable and irreversible were conspicuously absent from the document. It failed to explicitly define the scope of denuclearization, and didnt outline how North Korea might go about achieving it.

Speaking to reporters a few hours after the signing ceremony, Trump said the two world leaders had agreed to engage in vigorous negotiations to implement the agreement as soon as possible, though he provided no timetable for future talks.

When pressed to explain what exactly complete denuclearization means, Trump said only that the process would be done as fast as can be done scientifically [and] mechanically.

The statement contained positions that are already well-established (like North Korean commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and desire to work toward a peace regime on the peninsula), Oba told HuffPost in an email, referring to similar promises made by Kim in April during his landmark meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

Vipin Narang, an MIT professor of international relations, noted that the language in Tuesdays agreement bears striking similarities to a U.S.-North Korea declaration from 1993. Remember when they remade the movie Karate Kid 25 years later? Thats what this is, Narang wrote on Twitter.

Oba said the outcome was, however, largely expected given the complexity of these issues and the seriousness of North Koreas interest in maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent. He added that he would be keenly interested in whether follow-up talks led by Pompeo will lead to sustainable, longer-term diplomatic ties between the two nations.

Many presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper, only to find that the North Koreans either didnt promise what we thought they had or actually reneged on their promises, he said.

When quizzed on how that would be accomplished, however, Trump replied that it would be achieved by having a lot of people there ... combinations of both American officials and international representatives.

The president added that some things had been agreed to after the deal was signed because there hadnt been enough time during the summit. He said, for instance, that Kim had promised to destroy a major missile testing site. He did not elaborate.

Satellite imagery published last week by 38 North, a website devoted to North Korea analysis, indicating that the country had razed a key missile test stand. Its unclear if this is what Trump was referring to.

Trump said the U.S. had agreed to stop playing war games with Pyongyang, referring to the joint military exercises with South Korea that Kim has condemned in the past. He added that he wants to bring our soldiers back home from South Korea, but said troop withdrawal was not part of the equation right now.

Some also pointed out that three of the four points outlined in the memorandum echoed Kims agenda for the meeting, as outlined by North Koreas official Korean Central News Agency prior to the summit.

North Koreas goal was to give up as little as possible, whereas the U.S. goal was to get as much as possible, Oba said. North Korea had a lower bar for success and that gave them the upper hand, something which is reflected in a statement that largely stays true to North Koreas existing positions.

Trump acknowledged that the summit was just the beginning of a potentially long and challenging process. If you dont get the ball over the goal line, it doesnt mean enough, he said at the press conference."
2018-03-28,The Huffington Post,Yes Bookmobiles Are Still A Thing We Checked,"Hennessee, 51, started doing this job in 1995, when bookmobiles  miniature, mobile libraries in the backs of walk-on vans  were in their heyday. At the time, there were nearly 1,000 operating across the United States. Now, there are fewer than 650, according to the most recent data from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a research arm of the federal government.

Kentucky has 75 bookmobiles, the most of any state. In Graves County, Hennessee stops at day care centers and schools, bringing books to low-income children whose parents may not have time to stop by the library. She stops at nursing homes, whose residents may not be able to drive. And as access to high-speed internet becomes increasingly essential, she connects residents in remote areas to broadband through the bookmobiles hotspot.

The preschoolers fit their tiny feet into footprint stickers on the floor, where they waited to check out their books. The children swap books with each other so they can have fresh reading material every night, said Nichole Gibson, director of the day care center. This helps encourage parents to read to their children, she said, when some may not make it a priority.

About 18 percent of bookmobiles operated in a rural area in 2015, according to a Stateline analysis of the Institute of Museum and Library Services data. And more are starting up. The rural library system of Summers County, West Virginia, last summer received $35,000 to buy a new bookmobile, in the form of a grant from the U.S. Department of Agricultures rural development program. The New Mexico State Library bought two new bookmobiles last month to serve rural areas.

Just before lunch, she pulls in front of the house of Katie Wooley, a retired teacher who isnt Amish but lives in the area, and starts scanning the shelves for books to take to her. She likes cozy mysteries, she said, pulling a book called Banana Cream Pie Murder. Hennessee opens the front cover and, when she sees the initials KW, puts it back. Her patrons often mark their books so they can remember what theyve already read."
2018-04-22,The Huffington Post,Militarized Cops At Tiny Georgia Neo-Nazi Rally Arrest Counterprotesters For Wearing Masks,"Police officers arrived before the rally began and approached a group of about 50 anti-fascist protesters. They demanded the protesters remove their masks or face arrest. The officers  who wore bulletproof vests and helmets, and carried semi-automatic rifles  cornered the anti-fascist protesters, then grabbed those who were still masked, tossing them to the ground and handcuffing them.

The lead officer in the arrests said the counterprotesters were breaking a state law regarding masks, likely referring to a seldom-enforced 1951 law originally aimed at combating hooded Ku Klux Klan members. Anti-fascist protesters  many belonging to chapters of antifa groups, known for sometimes violently confronting white supremacists  often wear masks to avoid being identified by both law enforcement and neo-Nazis.

The irony of enforcing masking laws to prosecute leftists is just incredible, said Molly, a counterprotester from Charlottesville, Virginia, who traveled to Georgia to protest neo-Nazis. She asked that her last name not be published for fear of retribution. Those are anti-Klan statutes.

The rally in Newnan was the latest, and one of the most pitifully attended, neo-Nazi events to be held in the South since the deadly Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville last August, when a neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters, killing one person and injuring 19 others.

The Newnan rally was organized by the National Socialist Movement, an older neo-Nazi group that favors explicit Third Reich iconography over the more coded racist memes of the so-called alt-right. Fewer than 30 NSM members, along with a small contingent of the white supremacist group League of the South, showed up for the event.

NSM members arrived about an hour late for their rally. Then they stood on a stage in the park, looking out over hundreds of counterprotesters yelling from behind a fence some 100 yards away as police helicopters and drones circled overhead.

Jeff Schoep, the so-called commander of the NSM, rambled about the need to keep Confederate statues. He referred to himself and his companions as Alpha males and complained about men who look like homosexuals by wearing skinny jeans. He also lashed out against the Zionist media for portraying NSM as a hate group.

Schoep then left the stage to address a gaggle of reporters. When asked by HuffPost about NSM members throwing up Nazi salutes, Schoep claimed they were actually Roman salutes. He then threatened to have HuffPost removed from the park for being disrespectful.

At 5 p.m. local time, less than an hour after the rally had started, police appeared to pull the plug on the sound system. An officer speaking into a megaphone issued a dispersal order, warning the neo-Nazis that they would be arrested if they didnt leave the park. They left without incident.

The paltry NSM showing was indicative of the gradually diminishing strength of the so-called alt-right since the Charlottesville rally last year. That rally, the largest of its kind of over a decade, was attended by upwards of 1,000 white supremacists.

Since then, alt-right figurehead Richard Spencer canceled a planned campus speaking tour after being humiliated by anti-fascist protesters at the University of Florida and Michigan State University. Last month, a domestic dispute precipitated the collapse of neo-Nazi group the Traditionalist Workers Party. Infighting has also severely fractured the rest of the alt-right.

NSM and League of the South now appear to be the white supremacist groups most willing to hold rallies. On Friday night, they held a meeting at a bar in Bremen, Georgia. The annual gathering is typically held on or near April 20, the birthday of Adolf Hitler.

Julio Gilgorri, 26, who has lived in Newnan for five years, had a different take on the anti-fascists arriving to drown out the neo-Nazis. Gilgorri was among hundreds of residents who attended a festival in the city square on Friday night, at which local businesses, churches and charities handed out #NewnanStrong T-shirts. Children drew chalk hearts and rainbows on the sidewalks, while adults wrote messages like Nazis suck.

Newnan has taken me in as a Hispanic American and someone whos looking for a new home. I felt accepted since the moment I stepped foot here, Gilgorri said. If we shut up and stay quiet and allow these guys to rally without any opposition, my opportunity might not happen for other people down the line."
2018-10-15,The Huffington Post,Judge Dismisses Stormy Daniels Defamation Lawsuit Against Donald Trump,"A federal judge on Monday dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by porn star Stormy Daniels against President Donald Trump and ordered the woman to pay the presidents legal fees.

U.S. District Judge James Otero said that Trump was well within his right to free speech when he tweeted about Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, earlier this year, saying she was a total con job. Those comments, which Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti called defamation, were just politics, the judge ruled.

The court agrees with Mr. Trumps argument because the tweet in question constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics and public discourse in the United States, Otero wrote. The First Amendment protects this type of rhetorical statement.

Avenatti on Monday said the ruling did not affect his clients other claims against Trump or the presidents former lawyer Michael Cohen and said he would appeal the dismissal.

Daniels is also suing Trump in Los Angeles Superior Court over a nondisclosure agreement, which was meant to prevent her from discussing her claim of a 2006 affair with Trump, saying its invalid because the president never signed it.

Daniels other claims against Trump and Cohen proceed unaffected. Trumps contrary claims are as deceptive as his claims about the inauguration attendance, Avenatti wrote on Twitter, saying he was confident in a reversal.

Re Judges limited ruling: Daniels other claims against Trump and Cohen proceed unaffected. Trumps contrary claims are as deceptive as his claims about the inauguration attendance.



We will appeal the dismissal of the defamation cause of action and are confident in a reversal.  Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) October 15, 2018

No amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels or her lawyer, Mr. Avenatti, can truthfully characterize todays ruling in any way other than total victory for President Trump and total defeat for Stormy Daniels, Harder said in a statement to the media.

Daniels filed the lawsuit earlier this year after she spoke about her claims that a man had made a threat against her if she spoke about her alleged affair with Trump to the media. The president, who has continued to deny any relationship with Daniels, later lambasted her claims on Twitter, saying they were a total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!

Daniels attorneys said the message amounted to an attack on her character and painted her as a liar, resulting in the defamation suit.

Otero had signaled last month that he might toss the suit, saying that much of the presidents rhetoric amounted to free speech by a public official on a matter of public concern."
2018-09-04,The Huffington Post,Rahm Emanuel Wont Seek Re-Election As Chicago Mayor,"Jim Young / Reuters Rahm Emanuel, who became mayor of Chicago in 2011, will not seek re-election next year.

CHICAGO (AP)  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced Tuesday that he wont seek a third term in 2019.

Emanuel said in a statement released by his office that being mayor has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime. The Chicago Tribune says he had already raised more than $10 million for another run for a four-year term.

Emanuel, 58, was a Democratic congressman and chief of staff to President Barack Obama before becoming mayor in 2011. He followed Richard M. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 years. His won a second term in a 2015 runoff.

His surprise announcement comes the day before the start of one of the biggest police-shooting trials in the history of Chicago  the murder trial of police officer Jason Van Dyke. The release of a dashcam video two years ago of the white officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times in 2014 drew the sharpest criticism of Emanuel in his two terms as mayor.

Many questioned whether his office delayed releasing the video to lessen political damage on Emanuel. The trial is expected to bring added scrutiny of how the city, and Emanuel, dealt with the case."
2018-10-12,The Huffington Post,White House Aides Hugely Embarrassed By Trumps Lunch With Kanye NYT Reporter,"The world is still talking about Kanye Wests bizarre lunch with President Donald Trump  including White House staffers. And many of them are feeling hugely embarrassed by the presidents Oval Office meeting with the rap star, New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman told CNN on Friday.

If you look [at the presidents] face as Kanye West was doing, essentially, his filibuster standing in front of the Resolute Desk, [Trump] looks speechless and confused, right. [Hes] uncertain quite what to do with this, Haberman said.

The reporter pointed out the facial expressions of Trumps daughter and son-in-law as further examples of the mixed reaction.

You can see Jared Kushner there looking very happy, his wife Ivanka Trump not looking quite as happy, Haberman said. That represented the split that you saw within the White House.

Haberman said White House staffers were troubled by the optics of the meeting.

I heard from other West Wing aides who were hugely embarrassed that that had happened, thought that was not a good look, that this is not a rock concert, she said.

The main sentiment I have heard is why have we taken what was a pretty good week for the president with Kavanaugh, which is something that Republican candidates heading into the midterms would probably rather be talking about, and why are we now doing Kanye Week?

West, wearing a red Make America Great Again hat, held forth for nearly 10 minutes in what seemed like a stream-of-consciousness rant. When he finished, Trump remarked: I tell you what  that was pretty impressive. That was quite something.

The President is listening, the tweet read. Let him know your priorities here.

It invited people to click on a link to the GOPs official website, where they could fill in a 32-question survey featuring questions such as: Are you concerned by the potential spread of Sharia Law? and Is Russia a concern to you?

On completing the questionnaire, it linked to a donation page on Trumps official website, which asked folks to please take the next step and consider making a contribution to help us enact our America First agenda and fend off vicious attacks.

Trump likely wont be focusing on any of the suggested priorities anytime soon:

2018-03-23,The Huffington Post,Trump Signs Omnibus Spending Package To Fund Government Through September,"President Donald Trump said Friday that he had signed the 2,232-page, $1.3 trillion spending bill that the House and Senate approved this week, funding the government through September and preventing an imminent shutdown.

The announcement came hours after the president threatened to veto the bill because it did not provide enough funding for his border wall or a solution for immigrants brought to the country as children under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.

Trump called the bill a ridiculous situation while speaking at a White House press conference, pointing to a large stack of papers that represented the package. But he said he had decided against a veto because the bill boosts military spending.

Theres a lot of things Im unhappy about in this bill. Theres a lot of things we should have in the bill, he added. Ill say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. Ill never do it again. Nobody read it. Its only hours old.

The bill provides $1.6 billion for border security measures including secondary fencing, levee fencing, pedestrian fencing and replacement fencing. Yet that amount falls far short of the $25 billion the White House had requested to construct a full wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico.

Trump once again blamed Democrats for the delay in finding a solution to DACA, an Obama-era program the president chose to end in September.

The package also provides a 2.4 percent pay bump for the military and a 1.9 percent bump for civilian government employees. It allocates $144 billion for Pentagon spending, along with increases for both U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The bill landed on Trumps desk six months after it was due, and around two days after it was first introduced.

Congress passed five continuing resolutions to keep the government funded while Republicans and Democrats negotiated priorities. Gridlock resulted in two brief shutdowns earlier in the year.

The president called on Congress to ban the practice of delaying votes with filibusters and to grant him the power to reject individual provisions of government spending bills so he could prevent future budget problems."
2018-07-17,The Huffington Post,Obama Warns In Mandela Speech That Strongman Politics Are Ascendant,"Former President Barack Obama offered a sobering and alarming view of the state of the world in what appeared to be a rebuke of President Donald Trump, warning that nationalist and populist sentiments are making their way into the mainstream.

Look around. Strongman politics are ascendant suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained but those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning, Obama said Tuesday during a speech in South Africa honoring Nelson Mandela.

He lamented the rise of populist movements that are being funded by right-wing billionaires intent on reducing governmental constraints on their business interests.

These movements, Obama said, have struck a chord among people living outside the urban core who feel like security is slipping away, their social status and privileges eroding, their cultural identities threatened by outsiders.

Many Western countries are experiencing the rise of far-right parties, he said, adding that these parties oftentimes are based not just on platforms of protectionism and of closed borders but also barely hidden racial nationalism. Some key indicators of this are the attacks on the free press and the use of social media to promote hatred, paranoia and propaganda.

Politicians have always lied, but it used to be that if you caught them lying, theyd be like, Oh, man. Now they just keep on lying!

You have to believe in facts. Without facts, theres no basis for cooperation. If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, its going to be hard for us to cooperate, he said.

He applied the analogy to the U.S. withdrawal of the Paris Climate Accord, noting that if American leaders deny the existence of climate change, even though most scientists around the world have reached consensus on the issue, it will be hard to cooperate with other countries on the issue.

He implored the audience to work toward democracy, a pillar of which should be truth-telling. The denial of facts could be the undoing of democracy, he cautioned.

People just make stuff up, he said. They just double down and lie some more. Politicians have always lied, but it used to be that if you caught them lying, theyd be like, Oh, man. Now they just keep on lying!

He has refrained from calling out Trump by name, but Obama hasnt shied away from expressing his opposition. He has often taken to social media to make himself heard, penning a long Facebook post last September to speak out against Trumps decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program."
2018-08-10,The Huffington Post,Donald Trump Jr Gets Duped By Doctored Graphic Shares It On Instagram,"A land where America is spelled Amreica, if only you believe hard enough. A land where anything can be made real, including crudely altered images of your dads approval rating.

Alas, that dream exists in only two places: Donald Trump Jr.s head and Donald Trump Jr.s Instagram feed.

On Friday the presidents son shared a poorly doctored image on his Instagram account claiming President Donald Trumps approval rating is at 50 percent, according to CNN. But if you look closely at that 50 percent, youll notice the figure is in a red box, which overlays the actual number: 40 percent.

Amazing. Trump Jr. wrote in a caption alongside the fakery, which he has since deleted. I guess there is a magic wand to make things happen and @realdonaldtrump seems to have it. #maga #amreicafirst [sic].

While the CNN segment itself was real, Trump Jr.s image was not.

In his defense, its an easy mistake to make when you presumably dont bother to watch the segment, then misrepresent its conclusions on social media. Anchor John Kings point was that while Trump deserves some credit for solid economic numbers, Barack Obama took office amid a historic recession, so its not a fair comparison either way, despite what the president may tweet:

Presidential Approval numbers are very good - strong economy, military and just about everything else. Better numbers than Obama at this point, by far. We are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a Blue Wave, but there might be a Red Wave!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 5, 2018

Polling aggregates show President Trumps approval rating is closer to 42.7 percent right now."
2018-07-26,The Huffington Post,In Off-The-Record Meeting Jonathan Chait Says Part Of Him Is Glad Trump Won,"On Wednesday, New York magazines periodic all-hands staff meeting came with a little bonus for the assembled staff: a 15-minute, onstage discussion between writer-at-large Rebecca Traister and columnist Jonathan Chait, with the magazines editor-in-chief, Adam Moss, sitting in as moderator.

All three are big deals in journalism circles for different reasons. Traister is the voice of a watchful liberal feminism. Chait is the voice of the damp and shrinking neoliberal consensus. And Adam Moss is a guy with enough National Magazine Awards to gag David Remnick.

According to half a dozen staffers in attendance, it was during this brief off-the-record discussion that Chait let his colleagues know that, in fact, a part of him is glad Donald Trump won the presidency.

This wasnt an accelerationist argument. This came in response to a question about how Chait and Traister balance their roles as citizens with their roles as journalists. Were they at all happy for the tremendous content of a Trump era? (This idea comes up a lot among journalists. In Showtimes documentary about The New York Times, executive editor Dean Baquet, after watching Trumps inauguration address, marvels out loud: What a story. What a fucking story.)

Traister went first and gave the right answer, which is no, one employee, whos been granted anonymity to speak freely about an off-the-record meeting, told HuffPost. She said there isnt a single molecule of her that is happy Trump won and that well all face repercussions for generations.

In his writing, at least, Chait seems generally aware of the stakes of a Trump presidency. Hes previously made reference to Trumps crazy, racist beliefs. Hes pointed out that the human toll of the cruelty [of Trumps policies] has horrified immigration-rights activists.

But in the New York meeting, he was glibber. He compared the situation to Jerry Seinfelds bit about how, from the back seat of a cab, the whole world outside becomes entertainment, the New York magazine staffer explained. He said hes deadened his emotions to a point where he doesnt get emotionally involved with the Trump situation.

According to the staffer, Chait said with a laugh: Maybe that makes me a sociopath. Some of the employees in attendance said the group was stunned by Chaits response; others were less surprised to hear this sentiment come from a self-described disenfranchised white man.

In an email to HuffPost, Chait clarified that he was referring to this Seinfeld routine, in which he describes the experience of riding in a cab and feeling like youre watching something happening to somebody else.

Chait also added that his comments were intended for an audience which, I assume, was familiar with my work and the obvious seriousness with which I take politics in general and Trump in particular. I was commenting in an ironic and self-deprecating fashion about the way in which I can professionally disassociate myself from the events I am commenting on."
2018-04-17,The Huffington Post,Civil Rights Groups Sue Missouri Saying Its Failing To Automatically Update Voter Records,"Missouri is violating federal law because it does not offer all residents the option to register to vote at the states motor vehicle agency or automatically update voter registration information when people notify the state that they have moved, according to a lawsuit civil rights groups filed against the state Tuesday.

Missouri Secretary of State John Ashcroft (R) and Joel Walters, the director of the Department of Revenue, which is responsible for issuing drivers licenses, have violated the National Voter Registration Act, alleges the suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.

The 1993 law requires states to offer people the opportunity to register to vote when they interact with the motor vehicle agency and other state agencies. If someone wants to register to vote at the motor vehicle agency, the information provided on a drivers license can also be used as a voter registration application for federal elections. The law also says states should update someones voter registration if they change their address at the motor vehicle agency, unless the person explicitly says not to.

But lawyers for the ACLU of Missouri, Demos and The Advancement Project say Missouri doesnt comply with those requirements in several ways.

First, they say Missouri election officials arent automatically updating the voter information of people who change their address with the state. Second, they say the state requires military personnel to fill out a separate form to register to vote when they want to get or renew a drivers license. Third, they allege the state is refusing to offer voter registration opportunities to people who cant prove they are citizens during a licensing transaction.

The plaintiffs say the states process could block the hundreds of thousands of people who move within Missouri each year from casting a valid ballot.

The suit wasnt filed on behalf of particular voters, but instead on behalf of the Missouri chapters of two groups that dedicate considerable resources to voter registration: the League of Women Voters of Missouri and the A. Philip Randolph Institute. Both organizations said in the court filing Tuesday that the DMVs current processes prevented many people they interacted with from getting registered to vote.

A large part of the reason our organization focuses so heavily on voter registration is to prevent these voters from being turned away at the polls, Patricia A. Jones, president of the A. Philip Randolph Institutes Greater Kansas City Chapter, said in a statement. Each year we have to educate voters on the need to update their registration addresses and assist voters in making sure that their registration information is current.

Demos and The Advancement Project sent letters to Ashcroft and Walters last year, in which lawyers for the groups said the men were violating NVRA and offered to work together on a remedy.

Maura Browning, a spokeswoman for Ashcroft, said her office had received the lawsuit on Tuesday and hadnt yet had a chance to review it."
2018-05-21,The Huffington Post,Roger Stone Says Hes Prepared For Conjured Up Mueller Indictment,"Long-time Donald Trump ally and GOP dirty trickster Roger Stone said Sunday that hes prepared if hes hit with an indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller. But he insisted any charges would be conjured up, and that they would have nothing to do with Russian campaign collusion.

Asked about a possible indictment on NBCs Meet The Press, Stone responded: I am prepared should that be the case. He said its not inconceivable that Mr. Mueller and his team may seek to conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business.

Stone, who was an informal adviser to Trump during his campaign, insisted there could be no charges involving cooperation with the Kremlin because no evidence whatsoever of Russian collusion has been found  though Mueller has yet to share his final findings.

Stone said he would chalk up any action against him as an effort to silence me.

NBCs Chuck Todd pointed out that he was hardly being silenced and was expressing his opinions even at that moment.

Stone has come under scrutiny because he admitted communicating with Guccifer 2.0, the Russian hacker or hackers who the FBI said leaked emails from Democratic National Committee members during the presidential campaign.

He also admitted publicly that he communicated with Julian Assange, who published the emails in WikiLeaks. The day before one of the batches of emails was leaked, Stone said Assange was going to deliver a devastating expose of Hillary Clinton.

Stone insisted on NBC that he had no advance notice of the content, source or timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures.

Stone said he has not yet been contacted by anyone on Muellers team. But he said that eight former colleagues have been terrorized by investigators.

Ranking Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said in response to Stones interview: Roger Stone is known for a lot of things; candor isnt really one of them."
2018-03-04,The Huffington Post,DOJ Report To Knock Trumps Favorite FBI Foil Over Leak That Helped Trumps Own Campaign,"Trump and his supporters have used the fact that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabes wife ran for a state Senate seat as a Democrat to paint him as a Democratic partisan out to get Trump. Despite irrefutable evidence that the bureaus public actions before the election actually hurt Clinton, Trump defenders on Capitol Hill and on Fox News have spun up a narrative alleging that the FBI leaked information ahead of the election to damage Trump.

The long-anticipated report from the Justice Departments inspector general  likely to be released this month or next  could further undermine that already ridiculous claim. Trump and his allies have suggested that McCabe leaked information that hurt Trump and helped Clinton. But the IGs forthcoming report is set to reveal the opposite: McCabe authorized leaks that damaged Clinton and aided Trump.

The IG, who has been looking into the FBIs handling of the probe since before Trumps inauguration, will criticize McCabe for authorizing discussions with a Wall Street Journal reporter for an Oct. 30, 2016, story that suggested President Barack Obamas Justice Department was improperly pressuring the FBI to drop a probe of the Clinton Foundation, The New York Times reported on Thursday night.

The Oct. 30, 2016, WSJ story portrays McCabe as caught between FBI agents who wanted to push the Clinton Foundation investigation and Justice Department officials upset the probe was being pursued so close to the election.

In the story, a person close to Mr. McCabe  likely bureau lawyer and senior McCabe adviser Lisa Page  revealed that a Justice Department official called McCabe on Aug. 12 and was very pissed off that the New York office was pursuing the Clinton Foundation investigation:

FBI texts disclosed to Congress revealed the backstory for this piece that the public doesnt often get to see. The texts show that Page talked to then-Wall Street Journal reporter Devlin Barrett, a well-sourced reporter on the DOJ beat who is now at The Washington Post. It was clear from the texts that their conversation had high-level authorization within the bureau, as the FBIs top spokesman was on the call along with Page and Barrett. The call was likely arranged as part of an effort to push back on a prior WSJ story McCabe was upset about. That article had raised questions about his oversight of the Clinton probe because his wifes failed state Senate campaign had received money from Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe at a time when McCabe had no involvement with the Clinton investigation.

Trump and his allies had quickly seized upon that Oct. 24 WSJ story about the 2015 political campaign of McCabes wife, Dr. Jill McCabe. At a campaign stop in Florida on Oct. 25, 2016, Trump said it was a disgrace that the man who was in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton accepted essentially from Hillary Clinton $675,000 that went to his wife. (The presidents comment was an inaccurate portrayal of the situation.)

Given the attacks against him, it would make sense that McCabe, who voted in the 2016 Republican primary, would want to push back on the notion that he was in the tank for Clinton. But it would be odd if the IG report faults Page for talking with a reporter with the permission of her boss in a phone call that was monitored by the FBIs chief of public affairs. Criticizing McCabe for authorizing Page to talk about an ongoing investigation seems like a logical outcome of the IG probe.

Although its tempting to try and read any actions taken by the FBI ahead of the election in a purely political light, the chief ideological commitment of many FBI employees  despite the bureau leaning conservative overall  is to the organization, its image and its prerogatives.

The chief motivation for disclosing information on the Clinton Foundation investigation likely wasnt damaging Clinton or helping Trump, but protecting the FBI and McCabe from Justice Department interference. Top bureau officials, like most people at the time, believed that Clinton was going to win the election. But they didnt want the public, and Republicans on Capitol Hill, thinking they let Clinton off the hook easy."
2018-02-26,The Huffington Post,Tammy Baldwin Aims To Win Back Rural Trump Country Running As A Progressive,"But Pepin County also voted for Democrat Tammy Baldwin by 3 percentage points, when she ran for Wisconsins open U.S. Senate seat in 2012. So for now, Pepin is also Baldwin territory, and the people who turned out on Presidents Day were there to meet with her and figure out how they can help her get re-elected in November.

Wisconsinites in the western part of the state who like Baldwin, however, rarely mentioned her progressive bonafides when they were naming reasons they support her. Over and over, they said shes responsive and willing to work with others. She is, in other words, typically Midwestern nice. (Being nice is so prized that one woman at the Stockholm meet-and-greet objected to the term Minnesota nice, saying that state shouldnt get to own the quality.)

Again, Im willing to sit down with anyone who wants to solve problems. But hes a lot of words and no action, she told HuffPost. Hes never taken a follow-up of calling [Republican congressional leaders] Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan and saying, lets work together on getting this through. Then his infrastructure plan came out with no mention of Buy America, which is horrifying to me.

Baldwin said she has no problem criticizing Trump. But she isnt making him a focus of her campaign, and shes not bringing him up every chance she gets. Indeed, during her three-stop swing through western Wisconsin last week, she mentioned Trump only once or twice by name, although she referenced the president a few other times. For one of the most liberal members of the Senate, Baldwin hardly talked fiery resistance rhetoric all day long.

I think there are a group of people who voted for him just because they couldnt vote for Hillary, she added, and now they feel somewhat responsible for all the angst thats going on, and they dont want it rubbed in their face."
2018-06-11,The Huffington Post,Pompeo Says US Objective For North Korea Summit Hasnt Changed,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday the ultimate objective of a historic summit with North Korea had not changed and the United States was eager to see if North Korea was sincere about denuclearization.

U.S. President Donald Trump holds a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on Tuesday with their talks expected to center on ending the Norths nuclear weapons and missile programs in return for diplomatic and economic incentives.

Pompeo said Trump was fully prepared for the talks, and was optimistic that the outcome would be successful, while warning that there was still lots of work left to do."
2018-08-17,The Huffington Post,Veterans Sue Over Reported Troika Of VA Shadow Rulers From Mar-a-Lago,"Walzs letter to Veteran Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie called on the department to turn over copies of all communications VA leadership has had with the three Trump associates.

Perlmutter and Moskowitz have attended high-profile events at the White House, including the signing of new VA accountability legislation last year. At the time, Trump called the men incredibly successful people who have an affinity for helping the veterans.

The White House insisted to ProPublica that the men have no direct influence.

A spokeswoman for the three men said the media has misrepresented their actions and used selective emails to paint a distorted picture of their efforts to help the VA and Americas veterans, ProPublica reported. The trios work consisted of volunteer efforts and simply recommendations requested by the VA. The three did not try to influence policy or personnel, the spokeswoman insisted."
2018-05-17,The Huffington Post,Devin Nunes Fundraising Off FBI Attacks Tells Potential Donors That Trump Says Hes A Hero,"WASHINGTON  House intelligence committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is continuing to raise campaign funds off of his defense of President Donald Trump, using a fundraising letter to tout a tweet in which Trump described him as a Great American Hero because of Nunes work undermining the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

In the letter, Nunes writes that hes standing strong with Trump and asks for a donation to take the fight to the liberals. He writes that he exposed the real collusion between the Department of Justice, the F.B.I. and the Clinton campaign through his work as House intelligence committee chairman.

When Barack Obamas Department of Justice and the F.B.I. used Hillary Clintons patently false opposition research to justify a warrant to spy on associates of the Trump campaign, I exposed the scandal and brought it to the attention of the entire nation, Nunes wrote.

The top of a fundraising letter sent to an individual in Virginia, which was obtained by HuffPost, promotes a tweet Trump sent about Nunes work:

That tweet was sent after Nunes appeared on Fox & Friends in February, when Nunes falsely said the president had never met with George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is working with special counsel Robert Muellers team.

Nunes says in his letter that he has earned the hatred of revenge-driven members of the Democratic leadership cabal and the Far Left media. He said he has faced an onslaught of lies, propaganda, attacks, slurs and smears, that Democrats had come unhinged in their attacks on him and that he was up against liars, propagandists and hypocrites from the Far Left fringe.

In Novembers midterm election, Nunes faces Democrat Andrew Janz, a deputy district attorney in Fresno County who raised more than $1 million in the first quarter, much of it from Democrats upset over the so-called Nunes memo and his attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI. The final report from Nunes committee released last month attempted to clear Trump of wrongdoing.

Its clear my opponent is only interested in pleasing the President, Janz told HuffPost in a statement. He takes great satisfaction in voting against our interests and stands by devastating tariffs placed on our farmers to serve Trump and his billionaire buddies. Theres nothing heroic about that.

Liz Mair, a Republican strategist with the Swamp Accountability Project, a group that is running ads against Nunes, called the letter mostly a political stunt undertaken to beef up direct mail appeals to rich Beltway donors to try to help him get through a tough cycle in which he faces a potentially viable opponent for the first time in a long time

Nunes is positioning as an opponent of the Deep State as a matter of political convenience because a Democrat has made his district potentially competitive, and Nunes is not well-liked among California conservatives another reason why he has to ask for money in Virginia, she said."
2018-11-01,The Huffington Post,Prison Where Whitey Bulger Died Is Known As One Of The Most Dangerous In America,"They screwed up. I dont know who picked Hazelton  its one of our most violent institutions, said Joe Rojas, the union president for correctional staff at Coleman, a penitentiary in Sumter County, Florida. Bulger had been incarcerated at Coleman for four years until his transfer to Oklahomas Federal Transfer Center on Oct. 23 and his subsequent arrival at Hazelton.

The administration is directly responsible for Whitey Bulger. You cant run the prisons on the cheap, and thats what we have  executive staff running prisons on the cheap. Eric Young, national president of the Council of Prison Locals

Rick Heldreth, the union president for correctional staff at Hazelton, cited two other murders and estimated there were over 200 violent incidents at the facility so far this year. He said he thinks the violence is only getting worse due to understaffing.

Just five days before Bulgers death, lawmakers including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the staffing issues at Hazelton and other federal prisons in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. They had been raising concerns about Hazelton for the last year, according to Eric Young, the national president of the Council of Prison Locals.

Coleman, unlike Hazelton, is known for being in the triangle of safe prisons for someone like Bulger, Rojas said. He explained that Coleman and U.S. penitentiaries in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Tucson, Arizona  where Bulger resided prior to his transfer four years ago to Coleman  are considered drop-out prisons that provide a safe environment for people who might be targets in a normal prison  places for snitches, for high-profile inmates, and for people that drop out of gangs, Rojas said.

Him being killed does not surprise me one bit, because of the lack of staffing [at Hazelton] and hes been labeled a snitch, the correctional officer said. The old saying is snitches get stitches and end up in ditches. I guarantee, whoever killed him, its a huge badge of honor to take him out.

While no one knows why Bulger was transferred, Rojas believes it may have had to do with friction between the inmate and a female supervisor. According to Rojas, Bulger told the supervisor this spring: Your day of reckoning is coming.

Prison documents (shared with HuffPost by a staffer who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job) confirm that Bulger was sentenced to 30 days in solitary confinement for threatening staff.  Those documents showed that Bulger remained in special housing  where he only got an hour of yard time and lost all his privileges  for six months until he was transferred.

But that still leaves questions unanswered. Rojas said an inmate would typically be sent back to regular housing once the 30 days were up. And nothing explains why Bulger was sent to Hazelton after his extended time in the special housing unit.

The Trump administration is currently looking to cut up to 14 percent of prison jobs throughout the BOP  some 6,000 positions  many of which were already vacant. Cutting positions papers over the decrease in staff, Young and other employees told HuffPost. Those staffing shortages mean that teachers and other prison workers are being called upon to execute correctional officers responsibilities, The New York Times first reported this summer.

Hazelton is down 77 positions, 42 of them for correctional officers, Hazelton union president Heldreth told HuffPost. Heldreth believes the staffing issues are to blame for the uptick in violence. Since the facility opened in 2004, he said, the prison usually averaged one murder a year, not three. And violent incidents now occur almost daily."
2018-04-14,The Huffington Post,World Leaders Respond To The Coordinated Strike In Syria,"The U.S., U.K. and France have defended their decision to launch coordinated strikes on the Syrian regime Friday night, calling it a necessary move to stop the use of chemical weapons by Syria and its allies Russia and Iran.

In a statement Friday night, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the Syrian government of using weapons against its own people in the most cruel and abhorrent way.

The persistent pattern of behavior must be stopped, May said, referring to the regimes suspected chemical attack on the Syrian town of Douma last week.

Not just to protect innocent people in Syria from the horrific deaths and casualties caused by chemical weapons, she said, but also because we cannot allow the erosion of the international norm that prevents the use of these weapons.

May added that Britain has sought to use every possible diplomatic channel to stop the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, but our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted.

Our response is limited to the Syrian regimes capabilities to produce and use chemical weapons, Macron said. We cannot tolerate the normalization of the use of chemical weapons, which is a direct threat to the security of the Syrian people and our collective security.

Assad denounced the strikes against Syria and said it made his regime even more determined to fight and crush terrorism.

U.S., allies will not gain any achievements from crimes in Syria. Attacking Syria is a crime. U.S. president, U.K. prime minister and the president of France are criminals, he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday described the strikes as an act of aggression that would have a destructive influence on the entire system of international relations. At the Kremlins request, world powers will hold an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting to address the incident. Where Were You Until Today?

Canada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regimes ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people, Trudeau said. We will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice.

Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, said the joint attack on the chemical weapons facilities and capabilities ... will reduce the regimes ability to launch further chemical attacks.

The continuation of violence will only bring more violence, death, destruction and more displacement that the Syrian people are only being the victims off, spokesman Mohammad al-Momani said in a statement Saturday. The political solution preserves the unity of the Syrian people, and brings back security and stability to it.

For seven years, people have been slaughtered in Syria  brutality is going on. You remembered your humanity when [the Syrian regime] used chemicals? he asked. Where were you until today?

The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons, he said. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.

The U.S., France and Britain have accused the Russian-backed Syrian government of launching a chemical attack in the then rebel-held town of Douma last week. The attack left about 70 people dead.

The Syrian state has denied that its forces launched a chemical attack and accused rebels of fabricating reports of the attack in order to drum up international support for its fight against the regime."
2018-02-13,The Huffington Post,White Powder Letter To Trump Jr Reportedly Called Him An Awful Person,"The envelope containing a nonhazardous white powder resembling anthrax addressed to Donald Trump Jr. included a letter full of personal insults, according to New York media.

Trumps wife, Vanessa, was taken to a hospital on Monday after opening the envelope in her mothers Manhattan apartment.

You are an awful, awful person, the letter read, NBC affiliate News 4 New York reported, citing officials familiar with the case. I am surprised that your father lets you speak on TV. You the family idiot. Eric [another of President Donald Trumps sons] looks smart. This is the reason why people hate you. You are getting what you deserve. So shut the f**k up.

The New York Daily News reported slightly different wording: Youre an awful person and now you get what you deserve.

The powder was determined to be cornstarch, and reportedly postmarked from Boston.

Two other people, including Vanessa Trumps mother, were also taken to the New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center. Vanessa had complained of nausea.

Trump Jr., the eldest of the presidents three sons, addressed the scare in a tweet Monday afternoon.

Thankful that Vanessa & my children are safe and unharmed after the incredibly scary situation that occurred this morning, he wrote. Truly disgusting that certain individuals choose to express their opposing views with such disturbing behavior.

Trump Jr. has been a target of criticism for his role in a 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at New Yorks Trump Tower. Trump Jr. reportedly had been promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton, his fathers opponent in that years presidential election."
2018-02-26,The Huffington Post,Omarosa Manigault Newman Says She Was Shunned At Plantation White House Because She Was Black,"Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman was finally booted off Celebrity Big Brother on Sunday, but not before viewers were treated to more barbs against the Trump administration.

In her most explosive comments yet, Newman complained that she was shunned by others in the administration because she was a black woman in a White House that she compared to a plantation. Newman also said she was thinking of writing a tell-all about her experiences.

I was literally the only African-American woman on the senior staff, Newman said in a montage of clips that aired in a recap episode on Saturday. Im inside trying to fight for my own political life while Im going into meetings with people who are ignoring me. Because I was black, people wouldnt even talk to me.

When Newman finally left her job as the communications director of the White House Office of Public Liaison in December, she said to herself: Ooh, freedom, Ive been emancipated. I feel like I just got freed off of a plantation.

As for her tell-all tome, Newman said President Donald Trump was going to come after me with everything he has. Like, Im going up against a kazillionaire.

Check out the rest of Newmans reveals in the clip montage above."
2018-06-08,The Huffington Post,North Carolina Republicans Renew Push For Voter ID Requirement,"North Carolina Republicans introduced a measure on Thursday that would allow voters to choose whether to amend the constitution to require photo identification at the polls.

The measure is particularly significant in North Carolina because a federal appeals court struck down the states voter ID requirement in 2016, saying it was part of a larger set of voter restrictions that targeted African-Americans with almost surgical precision.

The measure calls for anyone who votes in person to provide photo identification. Lawmakers would then be able to define what kinds of voter ID would be acceptable.

This commonsense measure to secure the integrity of our elections system is supported by the vast majority of North Carolinians who know protecting our democracy should be one of lawmakers highest priorities, he said in a statement. The voters of North Carolina deserve a chance to weigh-in on securing their own rights in the democratic process, and will have the final say on strengthening election protections.

North Carolinas own post-election audit found that voter fraud is not a widespread problem in the state. An audit of the 2016 election done by the state board of elections found that just one case of in-person voter impersonation was referred to prosecutors. The case involved a daughter who allegedly voted in person on behalf of her dead mother to carry out her wishes. Nearly 4.8 million people voted in the 2016 general election in North Carolina.

The legislation needs to get the backing of three-fifths of both the North Carolina House and Senate. Republicans currently hold 75 of 125 seats in the House and 30 of 50 seats in the Senate. Lawmakers could vote on the proposal in the next few weeks, according to WRAL-TV.

Civil rights groups criticized the new push for voter ID in North Carolina on Thursday, arguing that it was an effort to reduce turnout among low-income and minority groups who might not have as much access to acceptable forms of identification as higher-income whites.

This is the latest in a long line of measures North Carolina legislators have pushed with one clear goal: to suppress voter turnout by making it harder for some of our states most marginalized voters, particularly people of color and those with low income, to participate in the democratic process, Sarah Gillooly, the director of political strategy and advocacy for the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, said in a statement.

The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Indianas photo ID requirement for voters in 2008. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 34 states have some form of identification requirement. North Carolina is currently one of the 16 that does not.

Its unfortunate that legislators think that they can hide another unconstitutional voter suppression effort by putting it on the ballot as a constitutional amendment and trying to trick voters into doing their dirty work for them, she said in a statement. A federal court found their previous scheme to require photo ID and limit voting access were blatant attempts to disenfranchise voters of color. What was filed today is no different. This is an obvious effort to implement a policy that has been shot down as being racially discriminatory."
2018-06-13,The Huffington Post,New Jerseys Tough Gun Laws Just Got Even Stronger,"Among the six bills are measures to expand gun background checks, tighten the handgun carrying permit process, reduce the legal capacity of ammunition magazines and establish a so-called red flag law, which allows people to petition for guns to be temporarily removed from individuals deemed to be dangerous.

We are proud to take these actions today, but let there be no doubt, our work is far from done, said Murphy.

With the governors signature, New Jersey added its name to a growing list of states that have enacted new gun control measures this legislative session, in the face of aggressive calls for reform in response to mass shootings in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas, and at high schools in Parkland, Florida, and Santa Fe, Texas.

New Jerseys A1217 builds on a growing trend of red flag laws, which gun violence prevention advocates say can be used to prevent suicides, as well as attacks like the Parkland shooting.

The legislation lays out a process for New Jerseyans to file gun violence restraining orders against individuals believed to be at significant risk of hurting themselves or others. A judge then reviews evidence and determines whether to order the individual to remain away from all guns for a period of up to a year. If there is cause to believe the individual is already in possession of a firearm, the judge will issue a warrant authorizing law enforcement to confiscate the weapons for the duration of the order.

With the addition of New Jersey, 10 states now have this sort of measure on the books, though the laws vary in their specifics. Five states have passed new legislation since the Parkland shooting.

New Jerseys A2758 codifies a state regulation that requires residents wishing to obtain a handgun carry permit to first show a justifiable need, as evidenced by specific threats or previous attacks. Although this requirement had technically already been in place in New Jersey, former Gov. Chris Christie (R) had loosened the restrictions, making it easier for people to get carry permits.

In the wake of a recent wave of mass shootings, gun violence prevention advocates have loudly pushed for legislation to ban semi-automatic military rifles like the AR-15, as well as bump stock accessories that allow those firearms to simulate automatic fire. New Jersey had previously passed restrictions on that weaponry, which is one reason why gun violence prevention advocates cite the state as a model.

Weve had really strong gun laws for a while, and were a good example of the fact that strong guns do work and save lives, said Nico Bocour, state legislative director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, who worked on the legislative efforts in New Jersey.

New Jerseys gun laws ranked second in the nation last year, behind California, according to the latest scorecard from the Giffords center. The state also has one of the lowest gun death rates in the nation.

During his remarks on Wednesday, Murphy said that while state action on gun control was important, it could only go so far in the absence of more sweeping federal legislation. He recalled a recent story about a nursery rhyme posted on the wall of a kindergarten classroom telling young students what to do in case of an active shooter lockdown.

This image for me, more than any, highlights the failure of Congress to take action on a national level, said Murphy. New Jersey will lead, but unless and until that day that we have commonsense laws coming from our Congress, our laws will continue to be able to reach only so far as our own borders."
2018-08-16,The Huffington Post,FCC Shuts Down Pirate Radio Station Known For Airing Alex Jones Shows,"The Federal Communications Commission has forced a pirate radio station off the air in Austin, Texas, that was known for rebroadcasting shows from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

The station, Liberty Radio, was also slapped with a $15,000 fine after operating from an apartment complex without federal approval since at least 2013, according to the Austin American-Statesman. The owners of the building have refused to pay the penalty, saying they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, according to court filings obtained by the newspaper. Its unclear if the shutdown is permanent.

The FCC, which manages the nations radio licenses, said agents were able to track down the rogue transmissions to a building owned by Walter Olenick and M. Rae Nadler-Olenick, who are named as defendants in a lawsuit filed Aug. 10 in federal court.

The building has a 50-foot tower that had broadcast audio on the 90.1 FM wavelength until at least December of last year, although the stations programming still streams online. Aside from Jones show, Liberty Radio also aired programs including The Vaccine Myth, War Room and Power Hour Nation, according to myStatesman.com.

The Austin American-Statesman, which first published news of the lawsuit, initially referred to Liberty Radio as Jones local flagship station, as did HuffPost. NPR notes that while Jones himself isnt affiliated with Liberty Radios 90.1 FM station, the frequency has long been known locally as a source for his content. The Austin Chronicle reported in 2014 that some referred to the channel by the nickname Alex Jones Radio.

FCC chairman Ajit Pai addressed the crackdown on Thursday during testimony before the Senate commerce committee, noting that the action had nothing to do with the content of pirate radio stations on air.

We act against pirate radio station because they are violating the law by broadcasting on the FM airwaves without a license, Pai said.

Prior to the lawsuit, the FCC told the pirate station in 2014 that it would levy the $15,000 fine but gave Liberty Radio 30 days to appeal.

We decline your offer, as we have from the outset, and we will forever decline your offer, the station responded. The case was later passed to the Justice Department, which filed the suit last week.

The news is the latest blow to Jones, a conspiracy theorist known for pushing bizarre claims, including that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax. He is currently being sued by several parents of the victims for defamation.

Jones and his website, Infowars, have been banned by several major companies in recent weeks. Google took down his YouTube channels, Apple banned several podcasts from iTunes, and Spotify, Vimeo, Facebook and Pinterest have followed suit.

Jones personal Twitter account was suspended for seven days on Tuesday after he urged his viewers to get their battle rifles ready. The social media giant, which has so far declined to ban him, said the tweet violated the companys rules barring the incitement of violence.

Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that while the station was known in Austin for rebroadcasting Jones shows, it was not officially affiliated with him."
2018-04-18,The Huffington Post,Karen McDougal Released From Contract Restricting Her From Discussing Trump Affair,"Former Playboy model Karen McDougal has been released from a contract with American Media Inc. that restricted her ability to openly discuss her alleged 2006 affair with President Donald Trump.

McDougal reached a settlement with the publishing company on Wednesday, freeing her from a 2016 legal agreement with The National Enquirer. News of the affair broke in February when The New Yorker detailed an alleged attempt during Trumps campaign to prevent McDougal from going public about the 2006 affair.

The magazine, owned by AMI, reportedly bought the exclusive rights to McDougals story for $150,000 and then spiked the article shortly before the presidential election in what is called a catch and kill.

AMI added an amendment to the contract after the election to allow McDougal to respond to legitimate news inquiries. The model filed a lawsuit in March to invalidate the contract, however, claiming that the agreement was created to silence and intimidate her.

I am pleased to have reached a settlement with AMI on my own terms, which restores to me the rights to my life story and frees me from this contract that I was misled into signing nearly two years ago, McDougal said in a statement to HuffPost.

AMI told HuffPost in a statement that the company reached an amicable resolution with Karen today that provides both sides what they wanted as a result.

The former model will be on the cover of the September issue of the AMI-owned Mens Journal, which will include a feature-length article about her. AMI also will publish five fitness columns by McDougal, the publishing company told HuffPost. AMI is maintaining a financial interest in any re-sale of an exclusive on Karens personal story, AMI added.

AMIs settlement with McDougal comes a week after the FBI seized material from Trumps personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The New York Times reported that investigators are examining Cohens legal agreement with porn star Stormy Daniels, who also claims to have had an affair with Trump.

McDougal told CNNs Anderson Cooper in March that after having sex with Trump, the president attempted to pay her for it. She also mentioned that Trump compared her to his daughter Ivanka, saying McDougal was beautiful like her."
2018-11-02,The Huffington Post,Twitter Chokes As President Grabby Hands Vows To Protect Women From Migrant Caravan,"What do women want? President Donald Trump thinks he knows.

Women want security, Trump said about the caravan of migrants heading to the U.S. border with Mexico during a rambling press conference on Thursday. Women dont want them in our country. You look at what the women are looking for: They want to have security.

He again proclaimed, without evidence, that the migrants were tough people, and warned that if they throw rocks at troops hes sending to the border, I say, consider it a rifle.

Many on Twitter were less than thrilled that the man who boasted about grabbing womens genitals whenever he pleased believes he knows what women want or what to do to make them feel secure. To date, more than 20 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct.

Besides the patronizing assumption that women need his protection, Trumps message also echoed racist sentiments of Americas past that minorities were out to rape white women:

2018-08-10,The Huffington Post,Candidate Kris Kobach Hints He Will Remove Himself From Overseeing Kansas Vote Tally,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach suggested Thursday he would recuse himself from overseeing how ballots are counted in the states GOP gubernatorial primary. Kobach is a candidate in the race and has an extremely narrow lead over his opponent, Gov. Jeff Colyer.

The announcement came after Colyer called on Kobach to step aside as ballots continued to be counted. In a letter to Kobach on Thursday evening, Colyer said that the secretary of state was conveying misleading information about mail-in ballots and that he had heard reports of Kobach telling county officials not to count ballots that had unreadable or missing postmarks. Colyer called on Kobach to allow the state attorney general to oversee the recount.

In an interview with CNNs Chris Cuomo on Thursday, Kobach downplayed his role in counting ballots but suggested he would remove himself from the process.

The counties do the counting of ballots, so theres really no point to it, but I said if my opponent wishes me to, Id be happy to. Its purely symbolic; I dont think he understands the process, Kobach said. Well be formally answering his request tomorrow, but Ill give you a heads up, yes, Ill be happy to recuse myself.

Asked to confirm that Kobach would recuse himself from the counting of ballots, spokeswoman Danedri Hebert said, The secretary of state doesnt count ballots.

Kobachs comments come after discrepancies emerged between the unofficial vote totals his office displayed and those reported by some counties. While those kinds of discrepancies arent unusual, they prompted increased interest in Kobachs supervisory role in the post-election count.

Kobach led Colyer by 121 votes on Thursday evening, but the tally is likely to change as more provisional and mail-in ballots are counted in the coming days."
2018-06-29,The Huffington Post,ICE Director Erroneously Blames Congress For Family Separation Policy,"When we asked for evidence of policies separating families, the White House referred us to items determining what happens to unaccompanied immigrant minors. But none of the children in question would be deemed unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents.

The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, for example, calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to family members or sponsors who can care for them as their immigration case is resolved. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which Trump has wrongly called a Democrat rule, determines that unaccompanied minors be transferred to Health and Human Services custody."

Its still unclear whether President Donald Trump will attend this years dinner after breaking tradition and skipping the event last year. He has said he will be attending the Gridiron Club dinner, another annual gathering of the D.C. press corps that he skipped in 2017.

Historically, the White House Correspondents Dinner has been a bit of a roast of the current commander in chief, and few would characterize Trump as having a thick skin.

President Trump passively rejects the findings of the major new US government multi-agency report that says climate change will wallop the US economy in years to come. https://t.co/ImcZSeAowf pic.twitter.com/hcUnY8Jdui  MSNBC (@MSNBC) November 26, 2018

The White House released the 1,700-page report the day after Thanksgiving, which many critics have said was an apparent attempt to bury the alarming findings. The report, which was produced by scientists from 13 federal agencies, concluded the United States would warm at least 3 more degrees by 2100 unless the use of fossil fuels was dramatically curtailed. It also connected climate change to other environmental issues, like record-breaking wildfires and storms, and warned of negative effects on the economy and American livelihoods.

A number of Republican senators downplayed the report and countered that federal efforts to reduce climate change could devastate the economy.

I think if were going to move away from fossil fuels, its got to be done through innovation. And innovation can be choked out through excessive government regulation. We cant let that happen, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said on NBCs Meet the Press.

The U.S. has warmed roughly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit in the past century, and 2017 was the countrys second-hottest year in history. Last year, the U.S. spent a record $306 billion on climate-related disasters.

Trump  who has rolled back numerous Obama-era climate protections and has moved to expand oil drilling in U.S. waters  announced last year that the U.S. would withdraw from the 2015 Paris accord to combat climate change."
2018-07-02,The Huffington Post,Trump Orders Flags Lowered To Honor Capital Gazette Shooting Victims UPDATE,"UPDATE: On Tuesday morning, CBS News reporter Mark Knoller tweeted that President Donald Trump will issue a proclamation that flags be flown half-staff to honor those killed in the Annapolis, Maryland, newsroom shooting.

Pres Trump to issue proclamation shortly ordering flags to half-staff to honor Capital Gazette staffers killed last week. Annapolis Mayor says his initial request to the WH for flags to be lowered was declined.  Mark Knoller (@markknoller) July 3, 2018

President Donald Trump declined a request from the mayor of Annapolis that he order U.S. flags be flown at half-staff to honor the five newspaper employees shot and killed in that Maryland city.

The mayor, Gavin Buckley, made the request last Friday, the day after a gunman entered the Capital Gazette newsroom, opened fire and killed four journalists and a member of the papers sales staff.

Buckley on Monday told The Baltimore Sun that Trump rejected the request. The paper also said the White House did not immediately respond to its request for comment.

Trump ordered half-staff display by U.S. flags for several days after a mass shooting claimed 17 lives at a Florida high school in February, and again when 10 people were killed in a similar massacre at a Texas high school.

As a presidential candidate and since becoming president, Trump and his aides routinely have dismissed various reports by mainstream media outlets  especially stories critical of him, as fake news. He has also attacked the press as the enemy of the American people.

In brief comments on Friday about the shooting in Annapolis, Trump said simply that journalists, like all Americans, should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their jobs.

Flowers and hand-written notes were left by mourners at a makeshift memorial outside the Annapolis Capitol Gazette office for the five employees killed by a gunman last week.

Obviously, Im disappointed... Is there a cutoff for tragedy? Buckley told the Sun about being rebuffed by Trump. This was an attack on the press. It was an attack on freedom of speech. Its just as important as any other tragedy.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, last Friday ordered state flags be flown at half-staff as a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless act of violence perpetrated... against employees of the Capital Gazette."
2018-10-12,The Huffington Post,This Is The Race That Will Tell Democrats If Theyre Headed For A House Majority,"Kentuckys polls close at 6 p.m. EST, meaning McGrath vs. Barr will be one of the first races to end and one of the earliest swing districts to record an outright winner. A victory for McGrath could portend a big night for Democrats. Even a narrow loss in a district like this one may suggest they have enough momentum to regain the majority.

That it is even contested is surprising. The 6th District has been a reliable Republican seat since Barr defeated former Rep. Ben Chandler (D) in 2012, and forecasters considered it safe when the 2018 cycle began. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee didnt include the district in an initial list of targets, and it recruited a candidate with the ability to self-fund his campaign in part to save money on a race it wasnt ready to prioritize.

But McGrath upended it all when she beat Lexington Mayor Jim Gray in the Democratic primary, erasing a 40-point deficit early in the race. This happened within a broader context of surging Democratic enthusiasm, especially among women, and sinking approval numbers for a Republican-led Congress, putting more seats into play. For Democrats, the central Kentucky district  which is largely rural but which includes blue strongholds in Lexington and Frankfort, the state capital  was now on the map.

Both parties are prioritizing the race. On Friday, less than 24 hours before Trumps scheduled appearance with Barr, former Vice President Joe Biden stumped for McGrath in a rural corner of the district. Democrats have prefaced Trumps appearance by circulating audio of Barr joking that the president has a tendency to exaggerate from time to time. Barr, who said the 8-second clip was taken out of context, responded by saying that McGraths embrace of Biden amounts to support for the failed policies of the Obama administration, which Republicans have long blamed (with little evidence) for the demise of the coal industry.

Her primary win made McGrath one of the most prominent of the women candidates who have pulled off upsets in Democratic contests across the country. Shes also one of a crop of Democratic candidates using their status as veterans to their advantage  her viral ad featured jarringly nonchalant b-roll of an aerial bombing  and the combination of traits has helped McGrath remain a fundraising machine in the general election. In the fiscal quarter that ended Sept. 30, she raised $3.65 million.

McGraths feminist bona fides have made her a darling of grassroots Democrats, but Barr has attempted to wield those same credentials against her. He has released ads that attack her for a speech where she said, Hell yeah, Im a feminist. He has tied her to liberal women like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), talk show host (and early McGrath supporter) Chelsea Handler and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. His ads have blasted McGrath as a rubber-stamp progressive in favor of abortion rights.

To McGrath, the discontent in her district is rooted in the belief that both parties have quit working on behalf of the common voter. National Democrats, she raged in the primary, are no longer fighting for Kentuckys workers. Republicans like Barr, she asserts now, are serving a wealthy donor class, not ordinary folks. Her evidence: Barrs reliable votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health reform law that helped give coverage to more than 500,000 Kentuckians, and his support for the 2018 GOP tax cut package that handed 82 percent of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent of households, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

She burnishes this with calls for expanded investment into the rural parts of the district. Rural broadband is a favorite topic; new infrastructure spending is another. On health care, McGrath doesnt go as far as the new wave of Democrats who call for Medicare for all. Still, she has advocated for expanding Obamacare by adding a public option and reducing the eligibility age for Medicare.

And then there is her feminism, which shes continued to foreground even as Barr has attempted to use it against her. Shes still the hell yeah feminist  the first female Marine to fly an F/A-18 in combat, a candidate willing to say she supports abortion rights and to argue for expanded contraception access, someone who believes this district is home to a lot of women who, she said, are fed up of the picture of a bunch of old white men sitting around making decisions that primarily affect women.

There are a lot of women in this district and the rest of Kentucky who feel like their ambitions, political and otherwise, have been suppressed, Cross said. And they see her as someone who will stand up for them and show that women can do this kind of job.

This approach worked in the primary. Can it work again with the more conservative general electorate? There are reasons to believe it could, not just because of the stances Barr has taken on the increasingly popular health care law and the never-popular tax cut package, but also because the landscape in Kentucky has continued to shift as the race has worn on.

Its one of the most interesting races in America, Jennings, the GOP consultant, said. And because of how early its going to be called, its going to tell us a lot about whats going on on election night and whats going on in America."
2018-05-08,The Huffington Post,Passengers Lashing Out At Scott Pruitt Justify First-Class Travel New EPA Memo Says,"Newly released Environmental Protection Agency documents attempt to justify administrator Scott Pruitts frequent use of first-class and business-class travel with a claim that fellow passengers were lashing out at him.

The 87-word memo, dated May 1, 2017, was drafted by Pasquale Perrotta, who recently quit as head of Pruitts personal security detail. Perrotta wrote that he had noticed lashing out from passengers which occurs while the Administrator is seated in coach with [his security detail] not easily accessible to him due to uncontrolled full flights.

We believe that the continued use of coach seats for the Administrator would endanger his life and therefore respectfully ask that he be placed in either business and or first class accommodations, the memo concludes.

The justification reportedly allowed the scandal-scarred EPA head to fly in premium cabins, often costing taxpayers thousands more than seats in coach. One trip to Italy cost more than $7,000, The Washington Post notes. Another to Morocco cost more than $16,000.

The travel memo obtained by the Post was among thousands of EPA documents released to media outlets on Monday in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. Many show efforts by Pruitts staff to limit his encounters with the public. Pruitt is facing 11 investigations into his spending, management practices and ethical lapses. Pruitts travel preferences are under investigation by the EPAs office of the inspector general.

The documents also reveal Pruitts practice of ducking interactions with average Americans, The New York Times reported on Monday, citing emails in a 10,000-document cache the EPA surrendered in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.

EPA officials choreographed appearances so Pruitt wouldnt face questions from the public, worked to limit social media postings during his trips to keep them private, and often arranged events in secret to avoid reporters.

He didnt want anybody to question anything, Kevin Chmielewski, Pruitts former deputy chief of staff for operations, told The Times. Chmielewski, who said he was pushed out of the agency for questioning Pruitt, said the EPA boss just doesnt understand what its like to be a public figure.

The EPA has maintained that Pruitt has gotten far more threats than his predecessor, justifying his large security detail and extravagant travel arrangements. The Times notes that there were 33 threat investigations underway as of mid-March. Ten of those involved Pruitt himself, including a message on a threatening postcard, missives posted to Twitter and emails and phone calls.

BuzzFeed notes that three investigations have been launched this year involving Pruitt, but all have been closed due to lack of evidence that the administrator faced serious harm. One such incident, closed due to a lack of an overt threat, involved a Newsweek magazine cover that someone drew a mustache on and taped to an EPA elevator.

The release of Perrottas travel memo comes several months after the EPA said Pruitt was booked into premium cabins because members of the public yelled at him too much. The agencys Office of Criminal Enforcement told Politico in February that the administrator was approached at the airport numerous times, to the point of profanities being yelled at him."

2018-09-20,The Huffington Post,White House Brags About Trumps Historic Recovery Effort In Puerto Rico,"White House officials on Thursday touted President Donald Trump and his administrations historic recovery effort and significant progress in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria devastated the island a year ago.

But even a cursory look at what has occurred over the last year would counter the administrations glowing press release, beginning with the nearly 3,000 people who died because of the storm, as reported in a George Washington University study. Trump has falsely claimed those figures were fabricated by Democrats.

Trump has constantly shifted blame to local officials on the island, as well as Puerto Ricos financial crisis. In a notorious visit to Puerto Rico last October to survey the devastation, the president appeared to show a lack of empathy for storm survivors, making much of the trip about himself.

The administrations celebratory press release Thursday touted signs of recovery, such as restoring 99 percent of power, water, roads and cellphone service in the year since the storm.

However, these efforts took months on end  for example, much of the island remained without power for prolonged periods, and the unreliable power grid suffered two outages earlier this year.

To add to childrens woes after the storm, Puerto Rico officials shuttered 255 public schools at the end of the last school year, in part because of the storm and in part due to the islands financial crisis.

In July, FEMA acknowledged its botched response in a report about its handling of the storm. But there are still many questions.

FEMA officials earlier this year moved a stockpile of about 20,000 pallets of water outside as a cost-saving measure. The water bottles became unusable after months in the heat, and the agency only admitted the problem when a photo of the water bottles went viral this month.

Trump has nevertheless hailed the administrations handling of the storm. Last week, as Hurricane Florence headed toward the Carolinas, he again praised the administration, saying that Puerto Rico was an incredible unsung success and unappreciated great job."
2018-04-13,The Huffington Post,Trumps Lawyer May Have Stored Gold Mine Of Recorded Conversations Report,"President Donald Trumps longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen was known to tape conversations with associates and store them  and Trumps allies are now worried the FBI has those files after raiding Cohens offices this week, The Washington Post reported Thursday.

An unidentified Trump adviser told the outlet that Cohen, who has worked with Trump for decades, had a proclivity to make tapes of private conversations and store them digitally.

The Post said it was unclear if Cohen had taped any conversations with Trump. But a source said it was Cohens standard practice to play recordings for the president that hed made of other top advisers. New York is a one-party consent state, meaning Cohen could legally record any phone conversation without the other persons knowledge.

Experts described the recordings as a potential gold mine in interviews with the Post, saying that if they exist and are admissible in court, they could prove extremely valuable to prosecutors.

Trump expressed outrage after the FBI raid earlier this week, calling it a disgraceful situation and a total witch-hunt during his off-the-cuff remarks to reporters. On Tuesday, he tweeted that attorney-client privilege is dead!

The FBI raided Cohens offices, home and hotel room earlier this week, taking his computers and phones and seizing documents related to a payment he said hed made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein personally approved the raid, The New York Times reported. The raid itself was executed by the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which is currently led by Trump appointee Geoffrey Berman.

A team at the Department of Justice would need to review any tapes the FBI has seized to determine whether they violate attorney-client privilege and fall within the scope of the search warrants.

Attorney-client protections do not apply to conversations that further a crime or act of fraud, Reuters notes."
2018-05-17,The Huffington Post,Scam PACs Ripped Off Conservatives With Pro-Police Anti-Abortion Messages Prosecutors,"William and Robert Tierney ran or were involved in nine different PACs that collected small donations solely to enrich themselves, prosecutors with the Southern District of New York allege in a criminal complaint. The supposed PACs collected $23 million from 2014-2017 and routed the vast majority of the funds through a series of shell companies that either directly enriched the Tierneys or continued the fundraising scheme, the complaint says.

The defendants, as alleged, capitalized on the sympathy and activism of those who sought to support awareness of various causes near and dear to their hearts, FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney Jr. said in a statement.

The charges brought by the U.S. attorneys office in Manhattan are so far the most high profile effort by federal law enforcement to crack down on operators of scam PACs. Scam PACs have emerged over the last decade as a new field for fraudsters to trick people, often the elderly, into giving up their money. This phenomenon emerged as campaign money boomed following a series of deregulatory court decisions and a declaration from the Federal Election Commission that it did not have the legal authority to crack down on scams.

In fact, prosecutors say, this article caught the eye of William Tierney, as it mentioned one of his supposed PACs. The complaint details an email in which he expressed concern to an unnamed co-conspirator that perhaps the PAC should spend more on politics to throw regulators off the scent.

But prosecutors say the co-conspirator dismissed the concern: The reality is that to these people there will be little difference between 0% and 5%.

Scam PACs almost always operate in a similar fashion. The founders take a cause or a candidate popular with elderly donors, say former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) or former Florida Republican Congressman Allen West, and spend money on telemarketing and direct mail to raise money. Those donations are then paid to the founders and also cycled back into further fundraising. Sometimes the scammers even own the firms doing the telemarketing.

The Tierneys set up six PACs  Grassroots Awareness PAC, Americans for Law Enforcement PAC, National Campaign PAC, Voter Education PAC, Action Coalition PAC and Protect Our Future PAC  and controlled three others called Life and Liberty PAC, Republican Majority PAC and RightMarch.com PAC. All were registered in other peoples names. For the PACs the brothers founded, a third, unnamed co-conspirator signed on as the treasurer using a middle name. (FEC records show the name Ann Mattson.)

Each PAC promoted advocacy on a particular issue that might attract small donations. Grassroots Awareness PAC claimed to be dedicated to raising awareness and advocating on behalf of children with autism spectrum disorder and other important health issues affecting Americans. Americans for Law Enforcement PAC said that it builds support nationwide for local law enforcement. Voter Education PAC supposedly promoted individual liberty, smaller government, traditional values, economic opportunity, a strong national defense and energy independence. National Campaign PAC, Action Coalition PAC and Protect Our Future PAC all targeted abortion opponents.

To obscure the involvement of the alleged profiteers, each PAC paid money to a series of phony shell companies, which prosecutors say William Tierney referred to as Stealth LLCs. In some cases, these were simply LLCs created to look like consulting firms that actually paid money directly to the scammers. In other cases, William Tierney told the telemarketing firms he worked with to create separate LLCs for each PAC they worked with to obscure the payments.

William Tierney allegedly provided an entire memo to the telemarketing firms detailing exactly how they should create these LLCs to establish our privacy goals. The LLCs should be set up on different dates and by different people who should not [be] someone easily discoverable on Google as being related to your company or each other. They shouldnt have a name that could identify them as related to the telemarketing firm or the PAC they would work for, he allegedly instructed."
2018-02-07,The Huffington Post,FDA Releases Kratom Death Data Undermines Its Own Claims About Drugs Deadly Harms,"In a press release Tuesday, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb sought to reinforce a November public health advisory in which he claimed there was clear data on the increasing harms associated with kratom. At the time, the FDA said it was aware of 36 deaths involving kratom, which it held up as evidence of the gravest of the drugs potential harms. The FDA has found eight additional cases since then, Gottlieb said Tuesday, bringing the total number of kratom-associated deaths to 44. He also announced the agency had conducted a novel scientific analysis of kratom that further supports the FDAs characterization of the substance as an opioid.

Kratom is an herb derived from the leaves of a Southeast Asian tree related to coffee. Its sold in the U.S. as an unregulated herbal supplement and commonly taken in powder form in capsules or tea. Kratom has opioid-like effects and is often used as a mood enhancer, or for its stimulant or sedative qualities, which can vary depending on the dose and strain. Supporters regularly tout it as a natural treatment for conditions like chronic pain, anxiety and depression. Others claim its a safer alternative to traditional opioids, both legal and illegal, which has also contributed to kratoms increasing popularity as a step-down treatment off of painkillers or heroin.

But due to the lack of regulations around herbal supplements, kratom is largely free from consumer standards on quality or dosing, leading to fears about the possible adulteration of products and problems related to improper self-medication or misuse by youth. The FDA has maintained that kratom is dangerous, and has pointed to the lack of an approved medical use as justification to impound numerous shipments of kratom products into the U.S.

FDAs list of kratom-related deaths also includes a 43-year-old man determined to have died from complications due to deep vein thrombosis. He had a long list of medical problems, including chronic back and shoulder pain and a history of alcohol and prescription drug abuse. At the time of his death, hed recently been prescribed five different medicines. His toxicology test came back positive for opioids, benzodiazepines  best known as Xanax  anti-depressants and a medication apparently used to treat his Tourettes syndrome. He also tested positive for kratom.

Just one of the FDAs cases appears to involve the presence of kratom alone, though the report includes no information on the death apart from the subjects age and ethnicity. The report shows the individual tested positive for high levels of mitragynine, but as in the rest of the cases, says nothing about how the substance was determined to have contributed to his death. The FDA denied HuffPosts request for additional information on that case.

Glottlieb specifically referenced prior FDA warnings about kratoms side effects, including seizures and respiratory depression. But these potentially deadly symptoms dont appear in any sort of discernible pattern in the cases the FDA cites, and theyre not well-documented elsewhere. While scientific studies on the effects of mitragynine on humans are still lacking  largely because its difficult to get funding for research on a plant that cant be patented  most of the emerging science on kratom has found it to be largely benign, especially when taken in low or moderate doses.

The FDAs presentation of kratom-related deaths appears to follow a broader practice, in which officials seem to be determining that any fatal incident involving kratom must therefore be related to the drug. But this haphazard characterization of kratoms supposed deadly risks does nothing to expand our understanding of how the drug supposedly kills people, if it does at all. And in fact, lumping these cases together despite their obvious dissimilarities may end up producing a misleading narrative about kratoms actual effects, said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University.

FDAs data could have severe implications for the future of kratom. The latest press release comes as the agency appears to be leading a push to ban the substance under federal law. Following pushback, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration postponed a move to place kratom in Schedule I, alongside drugs like heroin and LSD. But the FDA recently completed an analysis that may help determine how the DEA proceeds. A spokesperson for the DEA said Tuesday that it could take months or even years for the agency to reach a final decision on scheduling.

Based on the FDAs recent public actions, however, it appears to favor outright prohibition, a move that would cut off millions of Americans  many of whom have struggled with opioids or other prescription drugs  from their preferred method of treatment. Some drug policy experts and a handful of congressional lawmakers have said the damage caused by forcing people away from kratom, and possibly back onto other prescription or illicit drugs, would far outweigh the current harms. Furthermore, if kratom were to be banned, many individuals would simply continue buying and using it illegally. If feds are worried about controlling kratom now, driving it onto the black market will only make that harder."
2018-11-01,The Huffington Post,New York City Voter Guide Wrongly Tells Paroled Felons They Cant Vote,"A voter guide mailed to millions of New York City residents falsely states that paroled felons cannot vote in the upcoming midterm elections, the New York City Campaign Finance Board acknowledged Wednesday.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed an executive order in April restoring voting rights to anyone convicted of a felony who is out on parole. The guide was mailed in mid-October to registered voters.

On the second page of the 32-page document, the guide falsely instructs residents they cannot vote if they are on parole for a felony, WNYC reported.

The board apologized for the mistake in a statement and promptly corrected the information on its website.

Most states strip convicted felons of the right to vote while incarcerated, allowing them to resume voting after completing their sentence. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow even incarcerated felons to vote, while four states permanently disenfranchise those with felony convictions. Cuomos office noted in April that New York would join

13 other states and the District of Columbia in granting parolees the right to vote.

The governors office said that the move applies to around 35,000 New Yorkers out on parole. A request for comment was not immediately returned.

The New York City Campaign Finance Board stated its members are continuing to work with the Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers College and other organizations to speak with parolees directly and inform them about their voting rights. The effort includes a trip to New Yorks infamous Rikers Island prison complex, scheduled Friday, the board said.

Figuring out whether you can vote with a felony conviction is complicated. As HuffPost previously reported, the stakes are high: If youre wrong about your status, you can land back in prison for voting illegally.

Voting rules differ by state, with some requiring a full sentence  probation and parole time included  be completed before the right to vote is restored. According to the most recent estimates, from 2010, there are around 19 million people with felony convictions in the U.S.

The voter guide error was the second high-profile mistake made by New York election officials in the lead-up to the hotly contested 2018 midterm elections.

In mid-October, around 400,000 New Yorkers received notices saying that their voter status may have lapsed. The office of New York Mayor Bill De Blasio blamed the New York City Board of Elections, which stated that the letters were mailed by an outside entity. De Blasios office said the list of supposedly inactive voters came from a political consulting group, according to The New York Times."
2018-10-06,The Huffington Post,Trump Reacts To Brett Kavanaughs Supreme Court Confirmation,"I couldnt help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say hysterical, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said of Kavanaughs testimony.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) was the sole Republican lawmaker not to support Kavanaughs confirmation. In a thinly veiled threat, the president told The Washington Post that Murkowski will never recover from this.

The people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did, Trump told the Post after Saturdays vote.

Trump applauded Kavanaugh earlier on Saturday, saying that he will be a great Justice. He also praised Maine Senator Susan Collins (R), who had announced her support of Kavanaugh the day before, essentially securing his confirmation."
2018-07-24,The Huffington Post,Donald Trump Tells Kansas City Rally Everything Theyre Seeing Is A Lie,"Donald Trump is doing anything he can to hold on to his base  even employing propaganda tricks straight out of 1984.

On Tuesday, the President spoke at a Veterans of Foreign Wars gathering in Kansas City and told his followers to forget about anything else other than what he tells them.

Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not whats happening, he said.

The line fits with other famous lines of purposeful deception, such as Obi-Wan Kenobis These arent the droids youre looking for in Star Wars: A New Hope, and the Wizard of Ozs admonition, Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

However, ThinkProgress chillingly notes that Trumps demand directly correlates to the final, most essential command of the ruling totalitarian regime in George Orwells classic dystopian novel 1984: to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.

Trump decided to jump headfirst into that belief by telling the crowd, We dont apologize for America anymore. We stand up for America. We stand up for the patriots who defend America.

Jake Tapper noted on Twitter that those comments came eight days after he blamed the U.S. for poor relations with Russia.

When Trump wasnt engaging in what the novel calls newspeak, he lashed out at the media in attendance.

Dont believe that crap you see from these people, the fake news, he said.

Trump then called CNN the worst, and accused NBC of having its reporting created by the lobbyists and by the people that they hire.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the language used by the state of Oceania in the novel 1984. It is called newspeak, not truthspeak."
2018-02-12,The Huffington Post,What You Should Know About Trumps Nihilist Budget,"The budget document President Donald Trump released on Monday doesnt really matter. It will have no effect on government spending or tax levels. It will not build bridges or defund public housing programs. Congress controls federal spending, not the president, and for the past several years lawmakers have jettisoned the formal budget process in favor of a series of backroom deals.

The presidents budget has thus become an elaborate Washington ritual in which an administration expresses its values and priorities in the technocratic jargon of modern bureaucracy. Its an administrations way of telling the public how it would govern if it didnt have to work with Congress, and of demonstrating how much it cares about these proposals by working out in fine detail how much it all would cost.

Trumps budget shows he doesnt care very much about anything. The signature proposal, hyped ahead of the release as a $1.5 trillion program to rebuild Americas infrastructure, turns out to include just $200 billion in new spending  offset by $240 billion in cuts to existing infrastructure programs, including the Highway Trust Fund, Amtrak and the Army Corps of Engineers civil works initiatives.

The infrastructure plan is a good example of how Trumps supposedly populist campaign has not translated into populist governance. Trumps budget director, Mick Mulvaney, is a former member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which rabidly opposes spending on the social safety net.

Another budget bullet point  seemingly making good on Trumps campaign promise to end the opioid crisis ravaging America  comes to just $1 billion a year, a pathetically low number for a national public health crisis. Trumps boost to opioid spending accounts for less than 1.5 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services budget, which Trump would also slash by about 20 percent from last years level. By contrast, total defense spending would increase by about 25 percent over the course of the next decade. Thats real money, but it doesnt tell us anything important about American military objectives in places like Afghanistan, Yemen or Niger.

Public education advocates are understandably angered by Trumps call to cut overall federal education funding by $7.1 billion, while spending $1.1 billion on vouchers that families can use to pay for private school. But even this is a half-hearted measure. Trump has said he wants to spend $20 billion a year on the vouchers.

One area where the Trump administration showed some enthusiasm for policy innovation is in cracking down on food stamp recipients and their supposedly lavish and unhealthy diets. The budget would cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  the official program name for food stamps  by about 25 percent, replacing a portion of beneficiaries monthly stipend with canned goods and other healthy food chosen by the government. The idea is almost unheard-of on Capitol Hill and has little chance of being taken seriously by the committee that oversees the program.

Trump would also eliminate all funding for public housing repairs  a move that reflects general meanness about the lives of the poor, but only costs about $2 billion  and eliminate $1 billion in Section 8 vouchers to help poor families pay rent.

About 40 million Americans live in poverty each year, according to U.S. census data, including about 3.2 million who live on less than $1.90 a day, every day, according to The World Bank.

Taken together, Trumps budget reflects a strange bureaucratic nihilism. His budget proposal doesnt balance  not next year, or even over the traditional 10-year window, which would have allowed Trump to gimmick up the final years with spending cuts and various administrative fees that he had no intention of actually following through on. Hes accepting $900 billion-plus deficits every year until 2023, and substantial deficits through 2028. Its not like hes holding back from a big idea because hes worried about the price tag. He just doesnt care."
2018-07-09,The Huffington Post,Judge Rules Against Church Seeking To Offer Marijuana As Holy Sacrament,"An Indiana judge has ruled against the First Church of Cannabis, an Indianapolis church seeking to offer its members marijuana as a holy sacrament.

Judge Sheryl Lynch of the Marion Circuit Court decided Friday that the state of Indiana had a compelling interest in preventing marijuana possession, the Indianapolis Star reports.

Allowing religious exemptions for marijuana use would have an overall negative impact on society, Lynch said. She also argued that an exemption would put Indianas police officers in the difficult position of having to evaluate the sincerity of a marijuana users religious faith.

The undisputed evidence demonstrates that permitting a religious exemption to laws that prohibit the use and possession of marijuana would hinder drug enforcement efforts statewide and negatively impact public health and safety, Lynch wrote in a summary judgment.

The First Church of Cannabis first filed its lawsuit in 2015 in response to Indiana passing a Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The measure, which was signed into law by then-Gov. Mike Pence (R), reaffirmed that the government cant substantially burden a persons exercise of religion. Civil liberties and gay rights groups criticized the measure, arguing that business owners could cite their religious beliefs to deny serving LGBTQ people.

The First Church of Cannabis, which says it is a religious entity with its own sacred texts, rituals and holidays, sought to use RFRA in another way. The church claimed that Indianas laws against possessing marijuana have substantially burdened church members right to freely exercise their religion.

The group considers marijuana to be a healing plant that brings us closer to ourselves and others, according to the original complaint filed in 2015. It is our fountain of health, our love, curing us from illness and depression. We embrace it with our whole heart and spirit, individually and as a group, the complaint reads.

The First Church of Cannabis is recognized as a nonprofit corporation by the Internal Revenue Service.

Indianas laws against the possession, sale and use of marijuana protect the health, safety and well-being of Hoosiers statewide, Hill said in a statement released to the Indianapolis Star. When the state has justifiable and compelling interests at stake, no one can evade the law simply by describing their illegal conduct as an exercise of religious faith.

The groups attorney, Mark Small, told HuffPost that he disagrees with Lynchs decision and is seeking to take further action."
2018-04-12,The Huffington Post,Americans Are Surprised Domestic Terrorism Isnt A Federal Crime Most Think It Should Be,"Most American assume that domestic terrorism is a federal crime, OConnor said this week in a statement issued to HuffPost in his capacity as head of the FBIAA. The fact is, while the U.S. Code defines the phrase domestic terrorism, there are currently no penalties attached to that definition. Therefore domestic terrorism is not a crime in and of itself under federal law.

Among the slew of federal charges Saipov faces is a count of providing and attempting to provide material support to ISIS  a terrorism charge. He also faces eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering and 12 counts of attempted murder in aid of racketeering because federal prosecutors have labeled ISIS a criminal enterprise. Fields, meanwhile, faces a state charge of first-degree murder. Even though Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the attack was the definition of domestic terrorism, he hasnt been charged with any crime on the federal level, let alone a terrorism-related crime.

Sixty-five percent of Americans think the attack in Charlottesville counts as terrorism, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll. Twenty percent said they werent sure, and 15 percent said the attack wasnt terrorism. Clinton voters were more likely to think the Charlottesville attack was terrorism: 80 percent said it was, compared to 63 percent of Trump voters.

The lack of a federal crime of domestic terrorism affects how media outlets cover such attacks, as reporters often take the lead from prosecutors when describing them. Federal law enforcement officials are constrained in their ability to label acts of domestic terrorism as such for fear it could impact a future prosecution, as the Justice Departments top domestic terrorism official explained earlier this year.

The department is very judicious about deploying the term in the first instance, and typically will only do so in the backend of litigation when the facts and circumstances are going to be clear, Thomas Brzozowski said. By that point, he noted, the media narrative tends to be firmly established.

Under the current federal law, perpetrators can only be prosecuted on a terrorism-related charge when theyve either taken a very specific type of action or if they have claimed allegiance to a foreign terrorist organization thats on a list made up of mostly radical Islamist groups. In practice, this has meant the vast majority of people the government charges as terrorists are Muslim.

Even retweets in support of a designated foreign terror group like ISIS can be considered material support, and raise the possibility of a federal terrorism-related charge. According to The Intercepts Trial and Terror project, nearly 70 percent of terrorism defendants in FBI stings since 9/11 have been charged with material support  a charge that cant be applied to violent domestic extremists, the majority of whom are likely to be white or non-Muslim. The material support charge also makes it easier for the government to run sting operations against supporters of foreign terrorist groups than it is against domestic extremists.

An equivalent material support law that applied to domestic extremist groups would be unconstitutional and highly problematic: The government shouldnt be labeling U.S.-based organizations, whose speech is protected by the First Amendment, as terrorist organizations. But supporters of a change to the current federal law say the legislation could be tailored to apply only to acts of violence committed to advance a political agenda by intimidating the public or influencing government policy.

I think that domestic terrorism should be put on the same moral plane as international terrorism, Mary McCord, the former head of the Justice Departments National Security Division, previously told HuffPost. When the reason for a crime of violence is in order to influence a civilian population, or influence actions of the government ... it certainly has the same level of seriousness and should be taken just as seriously as international terrorism.

The outcomes for non-Muslim defendants can end up being much different than they are for people charged under laws that apply only to international terrorism. Muslim defendants will on average receive a 211-month sentence, according to a report released this month by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. Non-Muslim defendants, meanwhile, receive on average receive a 53-month sentence.

Its not as if right-wing and other non-Muslim extremists are less dangerous than Muslim extremists. If anything, studies have shown the opposite to be true. But youd never know that from reading Justice Department press releases. The DOJ issued press releases from its national office six times as often in regards to violent plots by Muslim-perceived perpetrators than violent plots by non-Muslim-perceived perpetrators, the ISPU report says.

Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGovs reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."
2018-11-28,The Huffington Post,Cindy Hyde-Smiths Response To Whether She Regrets Racist Comments Im A Cowgirl,"Mississippi Senate incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) didnt use the opportunity of an election win to express regret for making highly controversial statements throughout her campaign, instead saying that shes a cowgirl who likes western movies.

When asked whether she regretted any of the racist remarks about public hangings and voter suppression, she said that shes apologized and wants to move forward, then offered the following explanation:

Im a cowgirl and when a cowgirl references western movies that Ive seen hundreds of, and somebody twists it, thats just it, youve gotta roll with the punches.

Hyde-Smith did apologize after joking that if a local rancher invited her to watch a public hanging shed be in the front row to watch, but insisted that her words had been twisted for political gain. She didnt issue an apology after implying that voter suppression was a great idea during a campaign stop at a local university.

Its ok to still have a sense of humor in America isnt it? she instead said in a now-deleted tweet. These students enjoyed a laugh with Cindy despite out of state social media posts trying to mislead Mississippians.

Not everyone agreed. Several big organizations asked her campaign to return their donations, a Mississippi Rhodes scholar labeled her a white supremacist and nooses were hung outside the Mississippi State Capitol one day before Tuesdays runoff election to remind people that times havent changed.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized Hyde-Smiths remarks about the public hanging; she joked shed attend a public hanging at the request of a local rancher, not a hanging of the rancher."

It took tremendous courage for Dr. Ford to come forward, wrote attorneys Debra Katz, Lisa Banks and Michael Bromwich. The investigation conducted over the past five days is a stain on the process, on the FBI and on our American ideal of justice. The agency declined to comment in response.

The White House curtailed the scope of the FBI probe, and did not interview several witnesses whom Ford said she told about the assault long before Kavanaugh was nominated to the nations highest court. The FBI did not interview Ford during the investigation.

Unlike most matters handled by the FBI, the White House can direct the bureaus actions in a background investigation."
2018-10-10,The Huffington Post,New Reports Add Detail To Disappearance Of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi,"A string of reports on Tuesday added new, shocking details to the disappearance of journalist and government critic Jamal Khashoggi, including accounts of Saudi agents wielding a bone saw and a plea from his fiancee that he be returned home.

Turkish officials told The New York Times on Tuesday that Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post and a vocal critic of the Saudi government, was assassinated under orders from senior members of the Saudi royal court and killed by a team of people within two hours of stepping into the countrys consulate in Istanbul last Tuesday to pick up a marriage document. Fifteen people reportedly traveled to Istanbul aboard two charter flights, including one person who is believed to be an autopsy expert that may have helped dismember Khashoggis body to remove it from the building.

A Turkish official told Reuters last week that authorities believed Khashoggi had been killed in a premeditated murder and his body moved out of the consulate, but details have been slow to emerge and Turkish officials have not said how they reached such conclusions.

This image taken from CCTV video obtained by the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet and made available on Oct. 9 claims to show Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Oct. 2.

Khashoggi had long worked for the Saudi royal family and was employed by the countrys state-sponsored media for years. But he had recently become critical of the ruling royal family and leveled sharp criticism at the government.

The Post elaborated on those accounts in a separate story Tuesday, writing that the Saudi team laid in wait for Khashoggi to enter the consulate. Some of those men were later transported in a tinted van to the home of the Saudi consul general about two hours later, and then all of them left the country on planes departing to Cairo and Dubai.

The Saudi government has refuted those allegations, saying that Khashoggi left the consulate shortly after he entered. However, he has not been seen for more than a week, and the only closed-circuit television footage thats been released shows him entering the building but not departing.

The Times Turkish sources noted that the killing, if it did happen, could only have been ordered by senior Saudi leaders due to its complexity.

Khashoggis fiancee, who he was set to marry last Wednesday, issued a public plea to President Donald Trump, who is friendly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, asking him to investigate the disappearance. Khashoggi lived in self-imposed exile in the United States.

Although his opinions had angered certain people, he said, the tensions between himself and Saudi Arabia did not amount to hate, grudges or threats, his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, wrote in The Washington Post. Although my hope slowly fades away each passing day, I remain confident that Jamal is still alive. Perhaps Im simply trying to hide from the thought that I have lost a great man whose love I had earned.

The U.S. government has remained relatively quiet on the disappearance, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Saudi leaders to support a thorough investigation of Mr. Khashoggis disappearance and to be transparent about the results of that investigation.

Trump said Tuesday that he hadnt spoken to the Saudis about Khashoggi, but I will be at some point, according to the Associated Press.

For the sake of Jamals family, we call again for answers about Jamal and his whereabouts. Silence, denials and delays are not acceptable, Ryan wrote in a statement. We demand to know the truth.

Turkeys foreign minister said authorities would search the consulate in Istanbul as part of its investigation into Khashoggis disappearance, saying Saudi officials were open to cooperation, although its unclear when the event would take place. Some Turkish politicians have moved to downplay the Saudis role in the disappearance."

2018-07-13,The Huffington Post,The Top Bombshells In Robert Muellers Indictment Of Russian DNC Hackers,"WASHINGTON  Fridays indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers charged in connection with hacking the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintons presidential campaign made it clear that the special counsel team led by Robert Mueller still has a few tricks up its sleeve.

Here are the most crucial revelations the 29-page grand jury indictment brings to light.

Chiefly, the indictment names names. The defendants were part of the Russian Federations Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU). GRU units 26165 and 74455, the indictment says, conducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

The defendants, according to the indictment, were specifically involved in the effort to hack Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The Russians also monitored the computers of dozens of [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee] and DNC employees.

DCLeaks  a website launched in June 2016 to post hacked emails mostly targeting Democrats  claimed to be run by American hacktivists. It wasnt. The same computer that ran the DCLeaks Twitter account also managed a Twitter account called @BaltimoreIsWhr that posted images with the hashtag #BlacksAgainstHillary.

Using the name Guccifer 2.0, the Russians told Trump associate Roger Stone  identified in the indictment as a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump  that it would be their great pleasure to help.

As the journalist Marcy Wheeler points out, the indictment also indicates that Russia had access to the Clinton teams analytics, which could offer the Russians a guide to targeting voters as part of their effort to hurt Clintons campaign.

WikiLeaks  named as Organization 1 in the indictment  worked with the Russians to time the release of hacked emails to have the greatest impact on the election. WikiLeaks thought Clinton had only a 25 percent chance of losing to Trump, but evidently thought conflict between [Vermont Sen.] bernie [Sanders] and hillary could help.

And on July 27, 2016, the same day that Trump called on Russia to find 30,000 Clinton emails, Russians worked after hours to attempt to hack email accounts hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clintons personal office.

Last but not least, on Aug. 15, 2016, a candidate for the U.S. Congress requested stolen documents from the Russians posing as Guccifer 2.0. They obliged, and sent the candidate stolen documents related to the candidates opponent. The congressional candidate in question hasnt been identified."
2018-09-06,The Huffington Post,Sen Tom Carper Is In The Political Fight Of His Life Against Progressive Newcomer Kerri Harris,"Photos by Mark Makela for The Washington Post; Al Drago via Getty Images Kerri Evelyn Harris, a community activist, has mounted an unexpectedly spirited primary bid against Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.).

During an Aug. 27 debate, Carper preemptively defended himself on the issue, an acknowledgment of its importance in the race. He implied that it was incorrect to say that he had taken money from corporations, since corporations are legally required to donate to federal candidates through political action committees rather than directly. (He also highlighted his support for public campaign financing, among other far-reaching reforms.)

A Community Organizer Who Knows What Its Like To Struggle

Harris has struggled to provide for her two children, now ages 8 and 1, taking jobs as a cook at a gas station and as an auto mechanic. In a June interview with HuffPost, Harris recounted the ongoing challenge of making ends meet  let alone campaigning  on a modest income. She said she remembered the pain she felt over the years turning down her daughters requests to buy simple things. Her daughter would offer to pay for things herself with money from her piggy bank.

But 2018 is a year of high enthusiasm among Democratic activists. For Resistance voters fired up about President Donald Trump, Carpers votes in support of Trump administration officials may be even more of a liability than his record of standing up for the big banks. He voted to confirm Energy Secretary Rick Perry as well as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, among other Trump Cabinet officials. And perhaps most damaging, in 2006, he voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the federal bench (he has said he regrets that vote and plans to vote against Kavanaughs Supreme Court confirmation).

Harris believes that there is another Delaware that has not always been represented by the states Democratic members of Congress. She plans to win in large part by turning out many of the progressives, voters of color and working-class people who often stay home in midterm elections. Wilmington is a particularly target-rich environment for this approach: 58 percent of city residents are black; 26 percent live in poverty."
2018-05-09,The Huffington Post,Trumps Pick For CIA Director Wont Say Torture Program Was Morally Wrong,"WASHINGTON  Gina Haspel, President Donald Trumps pick to lead the CIA, told lawmakers on Wednesday that she would not restart the agencys defunct torture program if confirmed to head the CIA  but she refused to weigh in on the morality of the program.

Asked several times whether she thought the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques used by the CIA on terrorism suspects in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks were moral, Haspel dodged the question. She claimed the CIAs interrogation program was legal at the time, and said she now supports limiting interrogation techniques to the ones outlined in the U.S. Army Field Manuals.

I support the higher moral standard we have decided to hold ourselves to, Haspel said, pointing to anti-torture legislation passed by Congress years after the CIA shut down its interrogation program. (Torture was already illegal under the Geneva Conventions when the CIA began interrogating detainees using techniques like waterboarding.) The CIA should focus on intelligence collection and analysis and leave interrogations to the Pentagon and the FBI, Haspel said.

Haspel, who oversaw a black site where at least two detainees were waterboarded (one of them before Haspel arrived at the prison), faces a contentious confirmation process. Most Democrats are expected to oppose her confirmation because of her involvement in the interrogation program and her subsequent role in destroying videotapes that documented the interrogations. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has also said he will vote against her.

Haspel, the current acting CIA director, was expected to assure lawmakers on Wednesday that she would not restart the CIAs interrogation program  even if ordered to do so by Trump, who has expressed enthusiasm for waterboarding terrorism suspects. But Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee appeared frustrated that she would not outright condemn the CIAs past conduct.

I want to see, I want to feel, I want to trust that you have the moral compass that you said you have, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told her. Youre giving very legalistic answers to very fundamentally moral questions.

Im not going to sit here with benefit of hindsight and judge the very good people who made hard decisions, who were running the agency, in very extraordinary circumstances at the time, she told lawmakers on Wednesday.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) later told HuffPost it troubled her that Haspel did not answer four different times whether the CIAs interrogation techniques were immoral. I think she knows the answer and she didnt give it, Harris said.

Let me say this about myself. After 9/11, I didnt look to go sit on the Swiss desk, she said. I stepped up. I was not on the sidelines. I was on the front lines in the Cold War and I was on the front lines in the fight against al Qaeda.

Im very proud of the fact that we captured the perpetrator of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. I think we did extraordinary work, she continued. To me, the tragedy is that the controversy surrounding the interrogation program... has cast a shadow over what has been a major contribution to protecting this country.

I dont believe that torture works, Haspel said. But the CIA obtained valuable information through its interrogations, she claimed. It is unknowable whether enhanced interrogation led to that information, she said, echoing a longstanding CIA defense of the program.

Republicans on the Senate intelligence committee, meanwhile, said they were satisfied by Haspels responses about the CIA interrogation program, saying theyd received assurances from her in private that it was not moral.

I dont think I got that from her at all, Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) said when asked about Haspels dodging of the question. I think she shares my view and everyones view up here that it is immoral.

Lawmakers also pushed Haspel on her role in destroying 92 videotapes that showed the CIA interrogating Abu Zubaydah, the agencys first detainee. At the direction of her boss at the time, Jose Rodriguez, Haspel drafted a cable calling for the destruction of the tapes. Haspel said Wednesday that she supported Rodriguezs decision because the tapes could have endangered the CIA officials who appeared in them if theyd leaked.

When Heinrich asked why the CIA did not preserve a digital copy of the tapes with the faces of the CIA officials blacked out, Haspel said she didnt know. Im just not a technical person, she said.

Ahead of Wednesdays confirmation hearing, the CIA launched an unusually aggressive lobbying campaign on behalf of Haspel, pushing stories about her popularity within the agency and pointing out that she would be the first female CIA director.

Democratic lawmakers say the CIA selectively declassified information about the parts of her career that are flattering and withheld potentially damaging information. Haspel confirmed on Wednesday that she was involved in decisions about which parts of her record to declassify  but said she followed standard guidance.

While the CIA has highlighted the parts of her career that were unrelated to the interrogation program, the president has suggested that he chose her, in part, because of her role at the black sites."
2018-03-14,The Huffington Post,New Zealand Diplomat On US Democrats Get Your St Together Or We Will All Die,"A New Zealand diplomat to the United States is facing censure from her department after a series of loose tweets in which she told the Democratic Party to get your shit together or we will all die.

Caroline Beresford, who is New Zealands deputy head of mission to the United States, published the posts on her Twitter account on March 10. In replies to a tweet from political news website The Hill, which shared a link to an article with the quote a Sanders-Warren ticket could win big in 2020  referring to Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a former Democratic presidential candidate, and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)  Beresford wrote, No it couldnt. Please get your shit together or we will all die.

According to New Zealand website Newsroom, Beresford sent further replies to The Hills tweet regarding the Democratic Party, including Theyve learned nothing, and If this is what they have against Trump we should be planning for the eight years. Beresford later deleted the tweets and locked her account, making it inaccessible to people who do not already follow her on Twitter.

Yes I did send those tweets and realised very quickly that they were inappropriate, which is why I deleted them, the diplomat said in a statement.

The ministry does not in any way endorse the content or tone of the tweets, which we note were deleted, an MFAT spokeswoman said. Our code of conduct and guidelines around the use of social media set very clear expectations of staff when making public comment, including maintaining political neutrality and care in expressing personal opinion. These expectations were not met in this instance.

The controversial tweets are Beresfords second high-profile contribution to U.S.-New Zealand relations in recent times. Her dog was the catalyst for the first phone call between President Donald Trump and then-Prime Minister Bill English.

Not long after Trump ascended to the White House, New Zealand was trying in vain to link up a phone call with the new president. In a story told on a New York Times podcast, lobbyist Robert Stryk said he helped put the two leaders in touch after Beresfords Labrador approached him at a Four Seasons hotel in Washington. It led to Stryk and Beresford talking.

[Beresford] said she couldnt get a phone call set up between Bill English and Donald Trump, and this is one of our closest allies, Stryk told the podcast. They didnt know who to call. It wasnt a slight, it was just so chaotic."
2018-09-28,The Huffington Post,How Lindsey Graham Sidestepped Christine Blasey Fords Accusation,"Christine Blasey Ford vividly described Kavanaugh attempting to rape her when they were both teenagers, saying he pinned her to a bed and used his hand to stifle her screams.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and other Republicans have said Blasey must be mistaken about what happened. But on Thursday, in a fiery speech from the dais during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing  which had been precipitated entirely by Blaseys testimony  Graham ranted about a claim from another woman, who came forward this week.

Julie Swetnick said in a sworn declaration that in the early 1980s, she saw Kavanaugh at parties where groups of boys would rape girls. Her attorney is Michael Avenatti, who also represents a woman who received money to stay quiet about an alleged past affair with President Donald Trump.

Democrats did not ask Kavanaugh about the gang rape accusation, but Graham did during an angry few minutes of questioning from the dais.

Youre supposed to be Bill Cosby when youre a junior and senior in high school, Graham said. And all of a sudden, you got over it. Its been my understanding that if you drug women and rape them for two years in high school, you probably dont stop.

The serial rape accusation is ridiculous on its face, in Grahams view, because Kavanaugh has not been accused of any similar behavior over the course of his career.

Graham went on to say that voting against Kavanaughs nomination would be legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.

Later, during a closed-door Republican meeting, Grahams colleagues applauded him, as did conservative commentator Sean Hannity, who interviewed Graham on Thursday evening, when the senator railed against Senate Democrats some more.

Do you really believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a serial rapist? Do you believe any of this garbage? Graham asked on Hannitys program. Im sorry Dr. Ford went through this. She shouldnt have had to go through. But I am convinced beyond any shadow of a doubt that Brett Kavanaugh is not the man theyre trying to make him.

Blasey, the sole accuser who testified before the committee, did not say Kavanaugh drugged her or that he was a serial rapist. Not even Avenattis client said shed witnessed Kavanaugh raping people  she said shed seen him at parties where rape did occur and she thought he might have participated.

HuffPost asked Graham on Friday if its fair to say Democrats are claiming Kavanaugh was allegedly a serial rapist like Cosby, who has been accused of assault by dozens of women.

No, Im not saying that, Graham said. Im saying its fair to say that thats the accusation that came from Mr. Avenatti.

The process that we are engaging in has led to this accusation and nobody wants to talk about it because it is so over the top, he said."
2018-08-28,The Huffington Post,Trump Accuses Google Of Rigging Search Results To Feature Bad News About Him,"Larry Kudlow, Trumps economic adviser, told The Washington Post on Tuesday that the administration was taking a look at whether the government should regulate Google searches.

Google disputed the notion that it was using political favoritism to tailor its search results.

When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds, the company said in a statement. Search is not used to set a political agenda and we dont bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.

Trump regularly rants against media outlets whose coverage he doesnt agree with, and that at times also includes internet platforms. In October 2016, he tweeted, Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton."
2018-11-15,The Huffington Post,Florida Officials Order Hand Recount Of Ballots In Tight Senate Race,"TAMPA, Fla., Nov 15 (Reuters) - Florida election officials on Thursday ordered a hand recount of ballots in the tight race between Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson and his Republican challenger, Governor Rick Scott.

Nelson trailed Scott by about 12,600 votes, or 0.15 percent of the more than 8 million ballots cast following an electronic recount.

Under state law, the Florida Department of State must trigger a manual recount if an electronic recount of ballots finds a margin of victory of less than 0.25 percent in the race.

Elections officials were expected to inspect by hand any ballots that were designated undervotes or overvotes, cases where the machine that reviewed the ballot concluded that a voter had skipped a contest or marked more than one selection.

If the voters intentions are clear on review by a person, the ballot could be counted.

The order came after U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee, Florida, cleared the way to include ballots from as many as 5,000 people across the state who submitted ballots by mail that were rejected by election officials. A Georgia federal judge issued a similar ruling as that state worked to resolve a close governors race.

In Florida, the recount of close races and attendant legal disputes over the validity of votes have stirred memories of the 2000 U.S. presidential election, when the U.S. Supreme Court stopped an ongoing recount in the state and sent George W. Bush to the White House.

Initial counts before the recount showed Scott, Floridas outgoing governor, leading in his bid to unseat Nelson. Republican Ron DeSantis led Democrat Andrew Gillum in the governors race.

The Scott campaign in a statement said its margin of victory had increased moderately as a result of the recount and called on Nelson to concede.

Last week, Florida voters elected me as their next U.S. Senator and now the ballots have been counted twice, Scott said in a statement, calling on Nelson to end the recount process.

Palm Beach County officials said the machines they were using to recount ballots overheated and caused the county to miss the deadline for completing an electronic recount.

Overall control of the U.S. Senate is not at stake in the Florida race. President Donald Trumps fellow Republicans extended their majority in the chamber while Democrats took a majority in the House of Representatives. But both the Senate and governors races are being closely scrutinized as Florida is traditionally a key swing state in presidential elections.

2018-02-28,The Huffington Post,The Conservative Supreme Court Majority Was Built To Crush Unions,"After being roundly driven from power in the Great Depression, the conservative corporate class reorganized for the long haul in opposition to nearly every policy adopted as part of Franklin Roosevelts New Deal, from price and wage controls to Social Security to the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Wagner Act, which fully legalized labor unions and established federal oversight of labor-business relations.

Among all of these New Deal successes, workers empowerment was the most infuriating for wealthy conservatives. Labor unions were their biggest target because they represented organized opposition with significant monetary resources that supported social democratic policies and backed the political opposition to conservative business interests. As Walter Reuther, head of the United Auto Workers, once said, The labor movement is developing a whole new middle class.

Right-to-work laws ban unions from mandating the collection of agency fees, which cover the cost of collective bargaining and dispute resolutions. Without a mandate to pay these fees, employees can, and do, choose not to pay them while still receiving the benefits of union protection. Under these rules, unions are almost always short on cash and at a significant disadvantage to protect workers in contract negotiations and disputes.

Boulware hired actor Ronald Reagan, the former New Deal liberal turned free market true believer, to proselytize the pro-business agenda to GE workers. This was a successful move in both changing workers minds on unionizing and cultivating the future of free-market politicians. Reagans 1980 presidential victory was the crowning achievement of the conservative movement at the time and marked the beginning of the end of New Deal politics.

McCartin points to the work of the anti-union activist Sylvester Petro, whom McCartin wrote about in The American Prospect, as pivotal in raising the issue of public sector unions for the conservative movement. Petro was inspired by the writings of Hayek and von Mises and was a member of their Mont Pelerin Society, which had been funded by the same forces that emerged from the post-New Deal conservative movement. In 1957, Petro wrote his first call for the full repeal of the Wagner Act and the end to all collective bargaining.

By 1973, Petro was arguing that collective bargaining for public sector workers had destroyed government by putting labor unions on the same level as elected and appointed government officials in making decisions about funding and policy. He argued before the Supreme Court in 1977 in the Abood v. Detroit Board of Education case that public sector employees should not be mandated to pay agency fees.

Thats thanks in large part to the corporate elite and managers behind the anti-union conservative movement who, over the ensuing years, built and funded a conservative infrastructure to make the dreams of that small number of post-New Deal free marketeers come true. This included the creation of the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the State Policy Network and the Federalist Society. The latter counts four Supreme Court justices  Gorsuch, Chief Justice John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas  as members.

A wave of attacks on labor unions ensued, with six states adopting right-to-work laws over the next few years. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) and a newly elected Republican-controlled legislature immediately repealed the states historic public sector collective bargaining law in 2011. In 2015, Wisconsin would pass a right-to-work law. Michigan and West Virginia, both states important in the history of the American labor movement, also adopted right-to-work legislation. This was the most rapid adoption of right-to-work laws since the 1940s and 1950s.

Gutting labor union power was never just about establishing management power in the workplace, but also about gutting labor unions political power. Union members have long been able to opt out of making political contributions to union political action committees. But, as anti-labor activists pointed out back in the 1940s, unions also derive power from their ability to fund efforts to advocate for policies on behalf of their workers and keep workers connected to politics in their communities."
2018-02-07,The Huffington Post,Democrats Rally Against Trumps Plan To Let Restaurants Appropriate Workers Tips,"Democrats on Capitol Hill are urging the Labor Department to ditch a contentious proposal that would make it easier for restaurant owners to redistribute or keep their employees tips.

In a letter Tuesday to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, 24 Senate Democrats said the agency needed to bail on the measure because officials concealed evidence from the public projecting a significant loss in money for millions of tipped employees across the country.

The Labor Department is forcing through a regulation that would take money out of the pockets of low-wage workers and, even worse, it covered up the potentially catastrophic impacts from workers and advocates, the senators wrote.

They called it a stark example of how far the Trump Administration is willing to go to appease business interests at the expense of working families.

Last week, Bloomberg BNAs Ben Penn reported that Labor Department leaders had suppressed an internal analysis showing workers could lose billions of dollars in tips if the agency enacted the rule as proposed. The officials directed staffers to tweak their methodology so that the projections wouldnt be so alarming, according to Penn.

The revelations have whipped up Democratic opposition to a proposal that was already controversial and appears to have little support outside of the restaurant industry.

In 2011, the Labor Department under then-President Barack Obama instituted a regulation limiting the scenarios in which restaurants can force employees to share their tips with colleagues. The proposal from Trumps Labor Department would do away with that rule so that management could do as it pleases with servers and bartenders tips so long as they are paid a full minimum wage before gratuities.

The restaurant lobby says it wants the Trump administration to change the law so that restaurants can run tip pools, having servers and bartenders share their gratuities with back-of-the-house workers like cooks and dishwashers, who normally dont get tips. But the way officials crafted the new proposal, theres nothing to stop a restaurant owner from keeping a portion or all of a workers tips without distributing them to the other workers.

When federal agencies release a major rule like this one, they typically put out a study showing what its economic effects would be. The Labor Department did not do that in this case. Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate labor committee who spearheaded Tuesdays letter, said she requested an analysis when the Labor Department released the proposal late last year but still hasnt heard anything back.

The Labor Department has already carried out a 60-day comment period on the proposal, allowing stakeholders and members of the public to weigh in on the policy. The comments posted on the regulations.gov website  many of them clearly copy-and-pasted form letters  appear to overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Under the normal protocol, officials would now consider those comments as they tweaked the proposal before finalizing it.

In their letter Tuesday, the Democrats said the proposal runs counter to the Labor Departments very own mission statement: To foster, promote and develop the welfare of wage earners."
2018-10-21,The Huffington Post,Ammar Campa-Najjars Race Against Indicted Republican Duncan Hunter Shows How Hard It Will Be For De,"What you all have to understand  I need to stress this: We gotta check our feelings at the door about how we feel about the other side because theres no way on Gods green earth that we can win this race with only Democrats. It cant happen, he continued. This election is not about Trumpsters versus resisters, he said.

A Mexican-Palestinian-American Obama administration alumnus whos running against Rep. Duncan Hunter, Campa-Najjar faces a problem many Democratic candidates in traditionally Republican areas are wrestling with. In a district where just 27 percent of voters are registered Democrats, the odds of beating his opponent  even an opponent who is under federal indictment and is waging a racist campaign against him  are not in his favor. Even if Campa-Najjar gets every registered Democrat in his district to show up for him on Election Day, he may still lack enough votes to win. But if he caters too much to Republicans, he risks alienating his base while not winning many converts.

When he launched his campaign two years ago, replacing Hunter with a progressive Democrat seemed impossible. The 41-year-old Republican incumbent has represented the area since 2009, when he took over a House seat from his father, who was first elected in 1980. The last time the younger Hunter was up for re-election, he trounced his Democratic opponent by 27 percentage points. The district was one of the few in California that went for Donald Trump in 2016.

But in August, Hunter was indicted for allegedly funneling $250,000 of campaign funds toward personal expenses, including a vacation in Hawaii, a ski trip in Lake Tahoe and 30 shots of tequila at a bachelor party. A veteran, he told his wife to buy his Hawaii shorts at a golf pro shop so he could claim they purchased golf balls for a wounded warriors event, according to the indictment. Hunter denied any wrongdoing and blamed his wife, who was also indicted, for any misuse of campaign funds.

Campa-Najjar hopes that conservative voters who preach personal accountability, fiscal responsibility and family values will be so repelled by Hunters alleged corruption  and his impulse to shove any blame onto his wife  that theyll give the Democratic newcomer a chance. We cannot vote for a lawbreaker to be our lawmaker, Campa-Najjar constantly tells voters. How can we trust somebody to pass laws that he himself cannot follow?

Some of his supporters are eager to point out similarities between him and Barack Obama, but these days Campa-Najjar brushes off the comparisons. Im not into that hopey-changey stuff. Im not trying to be Barack Obama, he said at a meet-and-greet in Temecula, one of the more conservative parts of his district. Were both skinny brown guys with funny names, but thats pretty much it.

Perhaps most emblematic of Campa-Najjars approach is the way he explained his stance on immigration at a meet-and-greet in San Marcos. When Tom Theriault, a longtime Republican voter, pressed him on his commitment to comprehensive immigration reform, Campa-Najjar promised it was a high priority. But he stopped short of calling for decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings, as some progressive Democrats who are running for office did this year.

Instead, Campa-Najjar brought up the so-called Gang of Eight bill, a bipartisan immigration reform deal proposed in 2013 that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., in exchange for pumping billions more dollars into border security. He talked about his campaign manager, a Dreamer who was brought to the U.S. as a child without documentation, and quoted Bible verses that compel Christians to treat the most vulnerable with generosity. He said that some immigrants are rapists and killers  a nod to Trump supporters  but reminded the crowd that the biggest victims of crime by undocumented individuals are other undocumented immigrants, who are unlikely to go to the police out of fear of being deported. Campa-Najjar knew this wasnt the immigration response die-hard progressives craved.

Campa-Najjar, whose mom is Mexican-American and father is Palestinian-American, is Christian. He lived in the Gaza Strip during the second intifada for three years before his mother moved him and his brother back to San Diego, where she raised them as a working-class single parent. They lived with his maternal grandparents, and he worked as a janitor at his church to help his mom pay bills. He joined the churchs youth ministry in high school."
2018-03-14,The Huffington Post,Hundreds Of DC-Area Students Stage Gun Violence Protest At The White House,"WASHINGTON  As part of Wednesdays nationwide walkout against gun violence, hundreds of students from Washington-area schools gathered at the White House before marching to the U.S. Capitol, in a bid to take their gun reform message directly to lawmakers.

At 10 a.m., they sat for a 17-minute moment of silence in honor of the victims of last months massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, with some students holding posters with the names of the dead.

President Donald Trump wasnt there to see their protest as he was completing a trip to California.

Students told HuffPost that they had gathered early Wednesday morning at their schools in nearby suburbs and then took the Metro into the city.

Billy Scott, a student at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, said that like many other schools, his held a moment of silence on Wednesday. But he thought that participating in a protest at the White House would be a bigger show of support for gun violence victims.

Coming to D.C., coming to the White House, is a whole other thing to get our point across, he said. Power in numbers, right?

Vasiliki Frantzis, from Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland, said that she remembered the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, which she said made her think about why people would try to bring a gun into school.

Rohan Kurup, from Northwood High School in Montgomery County, Maryland, said that he normally has not taken part in student protests, but was inspired this time.

Most of the students who spoke to HuffPost said that school administrators and teachers seemed sympathetic toward students participation in Wednesdays walkout, although they couldnt publicly express that support. In fact, many schools nationwide have said they will penalize students with unexcused absences.

Callie Newburgh and Chloe Appel, from Magruder High School in Rockville, Maryland, said some administrators were worried that pro-gun people would put us in harms way.

Appel estimated that about half of her schools students were active in the protests, some at the White House and others at a lunchtime moment of silence at their school.

The other half thinks its useless because were minors, Appel said. There are so many minors being affected by this. We can really make a difference, even if were not 18.

Some students held signs noting that they would soon be old enough to vote, and their many chants included Rock the vote."
2018-05-02,The Huffington Post,Reminder GOP Target Rod Rosenstein Is A Lifelong Republican Trump Appointed,"A few days before the presidential election of 1984, the future deputy attorney general was upset over an editorial in The Daily Pennsylvanian that expressed dismay that then-President Ronald Reagan was polling better at Penn than the nations other premier universities. Rosenstein, in a letter to the editor, called the piece disgraceful and wrote that it was illogical and immoral to suggest the poll results reflected poorly on the university.

Perhaps if you took a step back from the Ivy Tower in which you and perhaps students at the more elite schools appear to be, you would recognize and respect the appeal Reagan has to the average American, Rosenstein wrote. I am proud to know that the opinions of students at our University are most representative of the nation as a whole.

Rosenstein  the man President Donald Trump nominated to become the No. 2 official at the Justice Department  is a Republican. Hes been honored by Harvard Law Schools Federalist Society. As a member of Kenneth Starrs Whitewater team, he investigated the Clintons (and even sat in on an interview with Hillary Clinton). Former President George W. Bush tried to make him a federal appeals court judge.

But thatd be tough to know if you watched Fox News most nights, or scrolled through the presidents Twitter feed. A group of Republicans in the House of Representatives have even drafted articles of impeachment against Rosenstein. Trump, who previously implied Rosenstein was a Democrat, tweeted Wednesday that he might have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!  implying that he could fire Rosenstein and perhaps shut down the special counsel investigation he oversees that has already taken down a number of Trump associates.

For those who have known Rosenstein well, the notion that the longtime Republican law enforcement official is a closet liberal bent on taking down the president is tough to digest.

Hes not some sneaky Democrat, says Megan Brown, a former official in the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration who worked closely with Rosenstein. Were in sort of a silly season on this, but hes not some sort of Democrat in Republicans clothes with some agenda.

The presidents favorite cable news channels continuous attacks on Rosenstein  including the suggestion that Rosenstein committed crimes and should be jailed  have made things pretty awkward for DOJs second-in-command. Until this week, his public comments were pretty much limited to making jokes about how much he hates D.C. or how he thought being deputy attorney general would be a relatively low-profile gig.

That changed after a group of House Republicans drafted potential articles of impeachment against Rosenstein. At an event on Tuesday, he suggested it was cowardly for the lawmakers not to put their names on a document they leaked, and said it illustrated the differences between how politicians and the Justice Department operate.

I can tell you that there are people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time, and I think they should understand by now that the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted, Rosenstein said. Were going to do whats required by the rule of law, and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job. We have a responsibility. We take an oath.

Rosenstein said that disputes with Congress over Justice Department documents  the ostensible reason some Republicans are targeting Rosenstein  needed to be worked out on a case-by-case basis. Republicans have requested sensitive documents, and DOJ said it would not provide one that laid out the scope of Robert Muellers special counsel investigation.

If we were to just open our doors to allow Congress to come and rummage through the files, that would be a serious infringement on the separation of powers, he added.

Although Rosensteins also come under direct criticism from Trump, he has had nothing but positive things to say about the Trump administrations agenda. On Tuesday, he said that Trump had appointed a leadership team at the Department of Justice that respects the rule of law and praised him for signing a staff-written Law Day proclamation that noted the importance of the separation of powers and the rule of law."
2018-10-30,The Huffington Post,Trophy Hunter On Ryan Zinke Advisory Council Bags Permits To Import 3 Lion Heads,"Steven Chancellor, an Indiana coal executive who raised more than $1 million for President Donald Trumps 2016 campaign, has obtained permits to import the heads and hides of at least three male lions from Africa since being tapped last year to advise Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke about the benefits of international hunting.

The retroactive permits, issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in early June and obtained by HuffPost through a public records request, apply to two lions Chancellor killed for sport in 2017 and a third he hunted in 2016. All three animals were killed in Zimbabwe, one of the African nations where the Trump administration lifted Obama-era bans on the importation of such animal parts.

In March, Zinke named Chancellor and several other gun and trophy hunting advocates to a new International Wildlife Conservation Council. The 16-member boards duties include advising the agency chief on removing barriers to importing legally hunted wildlife, streamlining the permitting process and reviewing import bans  and in some cases lifting those prohibitions.

Tanya Sanerib, international legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told HuffPost in an email that it is profoundly disturbing to see Chancellor getting import permits from the very agency he advises.

Last year, the Interior Department sparked controversy when it lifted Obama-era bans on importing elephant and lion trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia  a decision first made public by Safari Club International, a trophy hunting advocacy group with close ties to Zinke. Facing widespread public outrage, Trump swiftly suspended the departments decision. In a post to Twitter, he condemned big-game trophy hunting as a horror show, and said he was unlikely to allow such imports.

Despite the presidents pledge, the FWS issued a formal memo on March 1 that said it would consider permits to import trophies taken from elephants, lions and bontebok, a species of antelope, hunted in several African countries on a case-by-case basis. The guidelines effectively reversed the Obama-era bans on the import of such trophies.

Records show that between March 1 and Oct. 23, the date FWS completed HuffPosts records request, the agency issued permits for 17 hunters to import 19 sport-hunted lion trophies from Africa. Chancellor received a pair of permits covering his three lion kills, making him the biggest immediate beneficiary of the Trump administrations decision.

One of the federal permits appears to be for a lion Chancellor killed in the summer of 2016 in Bubye Valley Conservancy, a cattle ranch in southwestern Matabeleland, Zimbabwe. Records available on FWSs website show that Chancellor first applied for a permit to bring home the skin, skull, teeth and claws of the animal in January 2016, before the hunt and during the Obama-era ban.

Documents included with Chancellors 2016 application show that he paid around $60,000 for that hunt. Representing him in his effort to obtain the permit was Conservation Force, a trophy-hunting advocacy group and law firm based in Louisiana. The nonprofits president, John J. Jackson III, is also on Zinkes advisory hunting council.

In July 2017, Jackson spearheaded a letter outlining trophy hunters urgent wish list for Zinke. In it, he and executives at several safari clubs and sport hunting advocacy groups urged the interior secretary to change some policies that would ensure hunters could bring exotic wildlife killed in other countries into the U.S. Within months, FWS started fulfilling that wish list, as HuffPost previously reported.

The second permit covers two lions Chancellor killed in Bubye Valley Conservation in October 2017. In its lengthy approval, the agency determined that importation of the trophies will enhance the propagation or survival of the species.

African lions were listed under the Endangered Species Act in 2015. A provision of the law, which is intended to safeguard threatened species and the habitats critical to their survival, allows for sport-hunted trophies to be imported if the government determines that hunting will help safeguard the population. Trophy hunters argue that expensive safari hunting is crucial to the conservation of big game species.

Zinke, an avid hunter whose office features a slew of taxidermied creatures, talks often about the value that hunting and fishing bring to wildlife conservation. His creation of the pro-trophy hunting advisory council has outraged the vast majority of conservation groups and raised several ethics questions.

Ben Cassidy, who was appointed as Interiors senior deputy director for intergovernmental and external affairs last year after nearly seven years as an National Rifle Association lobbyist, appears to have played a sizable role in getting the wildlife conservation board off the ground, even though one of his former NRA colleagues is a member of the advisory council."
2018-05-09,The Huffington Post,Don Blankenships Defeat Is A Relief To The Families Of Upper Big Branch Miners,"Harrah has been living the last eight years with the Upper Big Branch mining disaster weighing on her. Her brother, Steven Harrah, along with 28 other men,  died in the 2010 catastrophe in Montcoal, West Virginia. A series of investigations found that the disaster could have been prevented had the mines owner, Massey Energy, not routinely skirted safety regulations and put profits before miners lives.

The credible Senate run made by Blankenship, Masseys unrepentant former chief executive, has made the Upper Big Branch tragedy feel like yesterday to Harrah and other families who lost loved ones. But his third-place finish behind Rep. Evan Jenkins and victor Patrick Morrisey in Tuesdays primary restored their faith in their fellow voters, knowing that a candidate who served a year in prison on a conspiracy conviction was rejected.

Despite investigators findings, Blankenship has never taken responsibility for what happened at Upper Big Branch. Instead, he has propagated conspiracy theories, blaming the government for his workers deaths and his prosecution, and claimed the explosion was the result of an influx of natural gas in the mine. Investigators found the explosions central cause was excessive coal dust that Massey failed to keep in check.

Apparently not enough voters bought Blankenships claims about Upper Big Branch, or his insistence that hed bring more jobs back to the states coal fields, to send him into a general election against Sen. Joe Manchin (D). Blankenship received 20 percent of the GOP primary vote, compared with Jenkins 29 percent and Morriseys 35 percent.

To Tommy Davis, who worked at Upper Big Branch and survived the blast, Blankenships campaign was an insult he couldnt escape, seeing him on television and hearing his voice over the radio in ads the millionaire paid for. The disaster took Davis son, Cory Davis; his brother, Timmy Davis; and his nephew, Joshua Napper.

In the weeks ahead of the primary, Davis was telling anyone who would listen not to vote for Blankenship, that the man put money before human life and should not represent West Virginia. Davis even confronted Blankenship at a Republican meet-and-greet, telling him he was to blame for the deaths at Upper Big Branch.

I think West Virginia sent him a message last night that he's not wanted here. Tommy Davis, who lost three relatives at Upper Big Branch

Nervous about Blankenships supposed surge late in the campaign, Davis spent Tuesday turkey hunting in the woods, trying to stay off the internet and away from the television until the final results came in.

The Upper Big Branch disaster made Blankenship the face of greed and recklessness for many West Virginians. In 2016, he was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of conspiring to violate mine safety laws  a charge not directly connected to the mining deaths  leading to his one-year sentence at a federal prison in California.

Republican leaders all the way up to President Donald Trump urged voters to reject the disgraced coal baron  not because he led a company that systematically endangered workers, but because they felt he would be a weak candidate in a general election. Trump won West Virginia by a whopping 42-percentage-point margin in 2016, which makes the GOP hopeful it can snatch the Senate seat from Manchin with the right challenger.

On the eve of the primary, Trump tried to remind his fellow Republicans of the cautionary tale of Roy Moore, the far-right candidate who won the Alabama GOP primary but later lost the general election after The Washington Post reported that hed pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls. Don Blankenship... cant win the General Election in your State... No way! Trump tweeted Monday. Remember Alabama.

Robert Atkins believes the presidents tweet influenced the primary. Atkins lost his son Jason at Upper Big Branch. During the campaign, he made a point of going to Blankenships events in order to speak directly to undecided voters and rebut Blankenships claims about what happened at the mine. When there were no campaign events, he went anywhere there were crowds  like local baseball games  to urge people to vote against Blankenship.

Atkins said he was happy to see the primary results, though he doesnt believe Blankenship will quietly go away, even after a decisive loss. West Virginia election law has a sore loser provision that prevents someone who lost a primary from running as an independent in the general election. Still, Blankenship could feasibly urge voters to cast write-in votes for him, or launch another bid in the next election cycle."

Sanders appeared on Fox & Friends Tuesday to lobby for the Senate to vote on Kavanaugh, who has become embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct. Sanders claimed that previous nominees didnt have a problem getting votes shortly after their hearings.

The president wants this process to come to a vote because thats whats supposed to happen, she said. In every single one of these instances where someone is nominated, they go before, they have a hearing and then the senators vote on it.

Of course, Sanders lament ignores the fact that Republicans denied a hearing and a vote to President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016. The GOPs argument at the time was that since Obama only had one year left in office, the next president had a right to fill the court seat.

Twitter users, including at least one Libertarian congressional candidate, were happy to jog Sanders memory:

Ummm ... sorta walked into that one. The Senate certainly had the right to not confirm Garland (for any reason including purely political ones) but not giving him a hearing was yet another break with tradition and not a good one.  Stevan Porter (@Porter4Us) September 25, 2018

Oh, like what the seditious @GOP did with say, Merrick Garland? Hypocrite much Sarah Sanders?



Its staggering how the @GOP expects to be treated in ways it wont treat others. You people have destroyed the concept of irony.  Chris Pierdominici (@nhmtnbkr1) September 25, 2018

Hypocrisy much? #MerrickGarland never even received a hearing & he was a moderate judge. The seat sat empty for over 400 days. There's no reason why #Kavanaugh shouldn't be properly vetted.

Really? So, what you are saying is denying a SCOTUS nominee and a President a hearing was wrong and inexcusable? And when we have allegations of sexual assault, we should suck it up and ram it through?   Barry Walters (@barryinct) September 25, 2018"
2018-03-23,The Huffington Post,Alabama To Put Ten Commandments Displays On November Ballot,"The states House of Representatives voted 66-19 on Thursday to advance a ballot provision that would amend Alabamas constitution to allow the monuments. The state Senate has already approved the Republican proposal, which does not need the governors signature, The Associated Press reports.

The move comes 15 years after Roy Moore, then the chief justice of Alabamas Supreme Court, lost his job for refusing to enforce a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments display from a state judicial building.

Under the proposed amendment, the Ten Commandments may be displayed on property belonging to public schools and in other state-owned buildings in a manner that complies with constitutional requirements. Those include placing the commandments alongside historical or educational items as part of a larger display.

The ballot proposal, submitted by state Sen. Gerald Dial (R), would prohibit the use of public funds to defend the measures constitutionality if it is challenged in court. Private money would fund the displays, the AP reports.

Ten Commandments displays in Alabama have provoked controversy in the past. In 2003, a federal judge ordered a 5,200-pound Ten Commandments monument removed from the lobby of the state judicial building in Montgomery. Moore refused to comply, and state judicial authorities ousted him as a result.

The Alabama Republican lost a special U.S. Senate election in December after several women came forward with sexual abuse allegations against him.

Democratic opponents of the proposal say it would violate the separation of church and state, the AP reports. They also worry public schools may have to pay attorneys fees if they face lawsuits over the displays.

Critics also said the legislation was a part of a GOP push to get conservative voters to the polls during a state election year.

The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union claimed the bill did nothing to expand or limit religious freedom protections that are already guaranteed under the First Amendment.

This is absolutely a waste of the states time and potentially money, Executive Director Randall Marshall said in a statement. Particularly when Alabama is facing so many other problems like failing public schools and overcrowded prisons.

Republican supporters of the bill said it is an affirmation of the right to religious liberty. The state has had a religious freedom amendment on the books since 1998, passed in response to the perceived weakening of religious protections.

I wish and pray that we get to a point where people would be free to express faith without fear of being sued, Rep. Danny Garrett, a Republican, told the AP.

Ten Commandments displays have remained a contentious issue in many states. Last June, a privately funded monument to the biblical laws went up outside the Arkansas State Capitol with the state Legislatures approval. Less than 24 hours later, a man drove a car into the display. The destroyed monument will likely be replaced this April."
2018-11-17,The Huffington Post,Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker Hit With Supreme Court Challenge,"ASSOCIATED PRESS Trump's choice of Matthew Whitaker to run the Justice Department is under attack in the courts.

President Donald Trumps appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general was challenged Friday in a surprise motion calling on the Supreme Court to substitute Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein instead.

Veteran Supreme Court litigator Thomas Goldstein argues that Whitaker  a Trump loyalist who was appointed to his post by the president last week  cannot take over for ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions because Whitaker hasnt been confirmed by the Senate.

The unusual vehicle for the challenge is a gun rights lawsuit that was initially filed against Sessions in his former capacity as attorney general. Goldstein is asking the justices to determine who should now be the valid defendant in the case  and many other pending cases directed at the federal governments top law enforcement official.

This is the extraordinary case in which the identity of the successor is both contested and has important implications for the administration of justice nationally, the motion states.

Goldstein contends that federal law requires that the Senate-confirmed deputy attorney general  Rosenstein  should automatically take over when the attorney generals office is vacant. Whitaker was serving as Sessions chief of staff, a post that was not Senate-confirmed.

Goldstein also filed a motion in federal court earlier this week challenging Whitakers appointment on behalf of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh (D), The Washington Post reported. It too argued that Rosenstein be installed in Whitakers place.

Whitaker is under pressure to recuse himself from anything to do with the ongoing investigation into possible Russian collusion by the Trump campaign. He previously expressed disdain for the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller.

The lawsuit linked to Fridays challenge was brought by Barry Michaels, a Nevada man convicted of securities fraud two decades ago, who wants the Supreme Court to rule that people convicted of certain non-violent felonies should not lose the right to own a gun. Its not clear when the justices will respond to the motion challenging Whitakers appointment.

The story has been updated with information about the underlying lawsuit."

But Trump ditched his planned visit and stayed in his hotel room because of unspecified scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather, according to a White House statement.

2018-06-29,The Huffington Post,Trump To Name Supreme Court Nominee On July 9,"SAUL LOEB via Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks to the press aboard Air Force One in flight as he travels from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, to Bedminster, New Jersey, June 29, 2018.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, June 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he plans to announce his nominee for a coming vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9 and that he has identified five finalists, including two women.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route from Washington to his private golf club in New Jersey, Trump said he may interview two contenders for the nomination this weekend.

He said he will not ask candidates whether they would overturn a 1973 ruling in the Roe v Wade case, which established a womans right to abortion, nor would he discuss gay rights with them.

The presidents nominee must win confirmation by the Senate. Republicans control the chamber but only by a slim majority, making the views of moderates, including some Democrats, important.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Friday he hoped the confirmation process would be done in time for the new justice to begin the fall term of the Supreme Court ... the first Monday in October.

That schedule would put a new justice in place before the congressional mid-term elections in November, when all seats in the House of Representatives and a third of those in the Senate will be contested.

Trump met on Thursday with senators from both parties at the White House to discuss the court vacancy created by the retirement of Kennedy, which was announced on Wednesday.

While Kennedy was a conservative, he proved to be a somewhat unpredictable swing vote over his long career. For example, he sided with the courts liberals by voting in favor of abortion rights in key cases. That issue was expected to be one that senators will ask the new nominee about in confirmation hearings, even if the president does not.

I do not apply ideological litmus tests to nominees, but I want to see integrity, intellect, a respect for precedent and adherence to the rule of law, moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins told Reuters when asked about Roe v. Wade.

Collins, who favors a womans right to choose on abortion, joined like-minded Republican Lisa Murkowski at the White House meeting. Also attending were Republican Charles Grassley and Democrats Joe Manchin, Joe Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp."
2018-05-01,The Huffington Post,Nations Top Teachers Confront Betsy DeVos In Private Meeting,"At a roundtable with the nations top educators on Monday afternoon, at least one teacher told Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that her favored policies are having a negative effect on public schools, HuffPost has learned. HuffPost has also obtained video of DeVos expressing disapproval of the teachers strikes currently roiling Arizona.

DeVos met privately with more than 50 teachers who had been named 2018 teachers of the year in their states. As part of the discussion, teachers were asked to describe some of the obstacles they face at their jobs and were given the opportunity to ask the education secretary questions.

I said, Youre the one creating the bad schools by taking all the kids that can afford to get out and leaving the kids who cant behind, Hazell said he told DeVos in response. (Hazell said he was not referring to DeVos specifically as creating the bad schools but to school choice policies generally.)

Brian McDaniel, Californias teacher of the year, confirmed Hazells version of events. He described the two as nearly engaging in a verbal sparring session and said DeVos staffers looked eager to take Hazells mic away, although they never did. Tara Bordeaux, Texas teacher of the year, said Hazells line of questioning hit on the concerns of a lot of educators right now.

At one point during the event, DeVos talked about how traditional public schools and charter schools should be thought of as parts of the same public school system, a comment that irked educators in the room because the two types of school are managed differently and subject to different rules and regulations. Charter schools are publicly funded but often privately operated. Melissa Romano, Montanas teacher of the year, and McDaniel said they believed DeVos was including voucher programs in that statement. Voucher programs provide children with publicly funded scholarships to private schools.

For her to say at the expense of children was a very profound moment and one Ill remember forever, because that is so far from what is happening.

Overall, both Hazell and McDaniel said, DeVos was a friendly, attentive listener who was respectful of the teachers opinions. They said teachers also remained respectful in their critiques. However, both said they left the meeting immensely disappointed.

McDaniel, a music teacher, initially had high hopes for the meeting. After he pressed DeVos for more support for music education, she expressed support for the subject and said she would look into providing more backing for the arts.

If I would have left the room right then and there, that would have been probably the greatest moment of my life as an educator, McDaniel said. Things slowly started to erode, though.

DeVos also expressed opposition to teachers going on strike for more education funding, per video of the meeting obtained by HuffPost. DeVos made her comments after Josh Meibos, Arizonas teacher of the year, asked her about when striking teachers will be listened to. In response, DeVos told Meibos that she cannot comment specifically to the Arizona situation, but that she hopes adults would take their disagreements and solve them not at the expense of kids and their opportunity to go to school and learn.

Im very hopeful there will be a prompt resolution there, DeVos can be heard saying in the video. I hope that we can collectively stay focused on doing whats right for individual students and supporting parents in that decision-making process as well. And there are many parents that want to have a say in how and where their kids pursue their education, too.

Meibos had protested last Friday with other Arizona teachers, many of whom are on strike over issues related to education funding and teacher salaries. The idea of his fellow teachers protesting while he was meeting with the U.S. secretary of education weighed on him.

She basically said that teachers should be teaching and we should be able to solve our problems not at the expense of children, Romano said. For her to say at the expense of children was a very profound moment and one Ill remember forever, because that is so far from what is happening."
2018-04-24,The Huffington Post,Donald Trump Roasted For Painfully Awkward Attempt To Hold Melanias Hand,"Sometime before Donald Trump picked dandruff off Emmanuel Macrons shoulder and engaged in a bizarre handshake/cheek kiss moment with the French president on Tuesday, Trump tried to hold his wife Melanias hand.

The moment was not a smooth one, and MSNBC cameras picked up the awkward attempt in excruciating detail. Video shows Trump using a few fingers to initiate holding hands  to no response. Then he tried again with his pinky, which also didnt work. Then he put multiple fingers in Melanias palm, which finally resulted in what looked like two people mutually agreeing to join hands.

2018-03-02,The Huffington Post,Beer Companies Say Trumps Aluminum Tariff Will Raise Prices And Hurt The Industry,"President Donald Trump announced a new tariff Thursday that beer producers and other beverage companies say will drive up their production costs by more than $250 million annually.

Slated to go into effect next week, the tariff imposes a 25 percent tax on all foreign imports of steel and a 10 percent tax on foreign imports of aluminum. Its intended to encourage U.S. production of those materials, but beverage companies that produce canned drinks say such a high aluminum tariff will deal their industry a blow.

MillerCoors, one of the U.S.s largest beer producers, released a three-part statement on Twitter shortly after Trumps announcement. The tariff will likely force MillerCoors and other beer companies to lay off workers, it said, hinting that the cost would be passed on to consumers.

MillerCoors statement: We are disappointed with President Trumps announcement of a 10% tariff on aluminum. While we wont know the details for a week, the Department of Defense recently reported that aluminum does not cause any national security issues. (1/3)  MillerCoors (@MillerCoors) March 1, 2018

Like most brewers, we are selling an increasing amount of our beers in aluminum cans, and this action will cause aluminum prices to rise. It is likely to lead to job losses across the beer industry. (2/3)  MillerCoors (@MillerCoors) March 1, 2018

We buy as much domestic can sheet aluminum as is available, however, there simply isnt enough supply to satisfy the demands of American beverage makers like us. American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of

this misguided tariff. (3/3)  MillerCoors (@MillerCoors) March 1, 2018

Khawaja Mamun, chair of the business and economics department at Sacred Heart University, said the beverage industry isnt exaggerating the likely negative effects of the new tariffs.

The tariffs will benefit steel and aluminum producers  the people who actually make it  but the people who use steel and aluminum to make other products will get hurt, Mamun told HuffPost.

He also predicted the price increases are going to hurt consumers, noting that if a beer company has to raise prices to match demand, consumer demand will be reduced as the product gets more expensive.

Mamun said its certainly possible that beer companies will lose hundreds of millions of dollars and shed jobs, as MillerCoors argues.

Yes, surely [they will lose money], he said. Any policy helps one group and harms the other group. In this case, the harm will outweigh the benefit as a total.

Several beverage companies, including MillerCoors parent company Molson Coors, signed a letter to Trump early last month urging him not to place a tariff on aluminum imports, particularly the types known as cansheet, primary aluminum and scrap.

A tariff or quota will immediately disadvantage these domestic businesses since foreign competitors would have the advantage of not paying an artificially inflated raw cost, the letter read. We estimate a tariff of 10 percent on this aluminum would cost beer and beverage producers $256.3 million, a 20 percent tariff would cost $512.5 million and a 30 percent tariff would run $768.8 million.

The letter was cosigned by more than a dozen companies and industry groups, including the Can Manufacturers Institute, Heineken and Coca-Cola."
2018-05-09,The Huffington Post,Establishment GOP Notches Win In Ohio Primary For Vacant House Seat,"State Sen. Troy Balderson narrowly defeated businesswoman Melanie Leneghan on Tuesday in the hotly contested Republican primary for Ohios 12th Congressional District, a battle that pitted the partys two major wings against one another.

Balderson beat out Leneghan as well as seven other GOP candidates, according to The Associated Press late Tuesday. He will face businessman Danny OConnor, who defeated five other candidates to win the Democratic nomination for a special election scheduled for Aug. 7.

Balderson was endorsed in the primary race by former Rep. Pat Tiberi, the Republican who represented the Columbus-area district before stepping down in January. Tiberi, a reliable ally of the House GOP leadership, spent nearly a half-million dollars from his old campaign account to boost Balderson, viewed by the partys establishment as a more suitable candidate to retain the suburban district, given the difficult political environment for Republicans this year.

Conservatives in Congress backed Leneghan, setting up the intraparty showdown. The House Freedom Caucus, led by co-founder Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), viewed her as the more solidly conservative candidate.

Last week, the group warned GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), to stay out of the primary fight. The conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth also contributed $190,000 that paid for ads supporting Leneghan.

Though the 12th district has traditionally been one the GOP could count on winning, the special election is expected to be competitive. And the winner of that race should have a leg up in the November vote for a full two-year term.

Balderson and OConnor also won the primaries to face off in the November elections for the seat.

In 2016, President Donald Trump carried the district by slightly more than 11 percentage points  a concerning margin for Republicans because of increased enthusiasm among Democrats that have marked recent special elections. In the March special election for Pennsylvanias 18th congressional district, for example, Democrat Conor Lamb edged his GOP opponent in a district Trump carried by 20 percentage points.

Were looking at a situation where every seat counts to maintain the House GOP majority, Matt Borges, the former Ohio Republican Party chairman, told Politico last month. Terming Leneghan out-of-step with mainstream Republicans, he added that the party didnt need any self-inflicted wounds in its fight to keep control of the House."
2018-09-19,The Huffington Post,Kavanaugh Accusers Lawyer Says Rush To Hearing Is Not A Fair Or Good Faith Investigation,"Republican lawmakers rush to go forward with a hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh before gathering more witnesses is an act of bad faith, a lawyer representing the woman accusing him of sexual assault said Wednesday.

In her statement, Lisa Banks, the lawyer for Christine Blasey Ford, denounced pressure from Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to move forward with a hearing involving testimony from Blasey and Kavanaugh without first conducting a formal investigation.

The Committees stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding, Banks said. The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth.

While Blasey (the psychology professor uses the name Christine Blasey professionally) has called on the committee to lead an FBI investigation into her claim before she testifies, Republicans have pushed back in the last day. Among them are Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).

Blaseys lawyer also stressed that the extraordinary circumstances make it necessary for her client to have more time before she gives her testimony, which is scheduled for Monday.

Dr. Ford was reluctantly thrust into the public spotlight only two days ago, Banks said. She is currently unable to go home and is receiving ongoing threats to her and her familys safety. Fairness and respect for her situation dictate that she should have time to deal with this.

Though the Justice Department has alluded that it wont reopen any background investigations into Kavanaugh, Democrats on the committee continue to sound support for Blaseys request.

I support Dr. Blasey Fords request for an FBI background investigation before a hearing, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Tuesday on Twitter. She should not be bullied into participating in a biased process and we should not rush forward before facts are gathered."
2018-06-15,The Huffington Post,Rudy Giuliani Says Mueller Probe Must Be Suspended Tomorrow After DOJ Report,"Rudy Giuliani on Thursday demanded that special counsel Robert Mueller end his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, saying a recent Justice Department report showed a clear bias.

The comments from President Donald Trumps personal lawyer come after the Justice Departments inspector general released a 500-page report about the behavior of senior FBI officials during the 2016 election. It was critical of former Director James Comey, calling him insubordinate. It also said other leaders at the bureau showed a willingness to take official action to prevent Trumps election.

Mueller should suspend his investigation, and he should go see Rod Rosenstein, who created him, and the deputy attorney general and Attorney General Sessions, who should now step up big time to save his department, Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, told Fox News Sean Hannity on Thursday.

One FBI agent, Peter Strzok, was singled out for text messages he sent during the campaign. Strzok was a lead investigator during the inquiry into Democratic candidate Hillary Clintons past use of a private email server, and he worked with Muellers team investigating any potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Thursdays report pointed to a text message Strzok sent to an FBI lawyer he was dating, Lisa Page, which the inspector general said was indicative of a biased state of mind.

[Trumps] not ever going to become president, right? Right?! Page wrote in a text message to Strzok on a work phone.

Page no longer works for the FBI, and Strzok was reassigned from his work on the Mueller probe last July after their text messages were first discovered. The report notes that Strzok told investigators the missive was meant to reassure Page generally and that it was not indicative of any planned behavior to influence the probe.

Giuliani, however, said the exchange showed a clear flaw in the special counsels investigation and called on Muellers work to be suspended.

Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions have a chance to redeem themselves, and that chance comes about tomorrow, he told Hannity. It doesnt go beyond tomorrow. Tomorrow, Mueller should be suspended and honest people should be brought in, impartial people to investigate these people like Peter Strzok.

Strzok should be in jail by the end of next week, he concluded."
2018-07-18,The Huffington Post,New Air Force One Will Be Red White And Blue Trump Says,"Trump recently told CBS News that two new presidential jets will replace the current model, customized Boeing 747s that made their debuts in 1990, and be filled with state-of-the-art technology. But the modifications wont be confined to the inside, and the president, known for his penchant for redecoration, said he has a grand vision to update the 30-year-old paint job.

Boeing gave us a good deal, Trump told CBS Jeff Glor in an interview that aired Tuesday. But I said, I wonder if we should use the same baby blue colors? And were not. You know what colors were using? Red, white and blue.

He continued: Air Force One is going to be incredible. Its going to be the top of the line, the top in the world. And its going to be red, white and blue, which I think is appropriate.

Officials said Tuesday that Boeing had officially won the $3.9 billion contract to build the two new 747-8s, several months after the company reached an informal deal over the aircraft. Theyre expected to be delivered by December 2024, what would be the last full year of Trumps presidency should he win a second term, Reuters reports.

Bloomberg notes that much of the cost comes from complex modifications that turn Air Force One  the technical name for any plane the president is traveling on  into a mobile White House. The aircraft will have self-defense capabilities, communication systems, and work and rest quarters.

Trump told CBS he was able to save $1.5 billion on the deal, although those savings couldnt be confirmed. He lambasted initial plans for the update shortly after his election, tweeting in 2016 that costs were out of control and threatening to cancel the order. Boeing was able to negotiate with the White House to cut costs, saying the president made a good deal on behalf of the American people, and Trump signaled his approval in February.

In Tuesdays interview, the president stressed that the new planes will be largely for future presidents, citing the very complex project. But he said the update was long overdue."
2018-08-23,The Huffington Post,Donald Trump Sparks Outrage By Tweeting White Nationalist Talking Point,"President Donald Trump faced more accusations of racism late Wednesday after he tweeted about white farmers in South Africa.

In an apparent response to a segment on Tucker Carlsons Fox News show, Trump said hed asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures:

Fellow tweeters accused Trump of promoting the white nationalist talking point that the South African government was waging a war against whites.

Khusela Diko, South African President Cyril Ramaphosas spokeswoman, told Reuters that Trump was misinformed about the countrys planned land reforms and that its government would take up the matter through diplomatic channels.

South Africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past, the South African government tweeted. South Africa will speed up the pace of land reform in a careful and inclusive manner that does not divide our nation.

2018-03-26,The Huffington Post,In Trumps Universe Human Rights Catastrophes Can Only Get Worse,"Trump claims he got the idea for killing drug dealers from his pal, Chinese president for life, Xi Jinping. Thats a first: an American president openly borrowing a criminal justice program from an autocrat (and a Communist one, to boot).  To be fair, Trump clearly also had in mind the experience of a democratic country. In the last two years, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has encouraged a spree of extrajudicial police executions aimed at the drug trade that, according to Human Rights Watch, has left more than 12,000 Filipinos dead. Although the International Criminal Court has launched an inquiry into Dutertes crimes against humanity, Trump has praised him for doing an incredible job with his anti-drug program.

Sure, the State Department has been issuing an exhaustive annual report on human rights violators that, for half a century, provided grim details on repressive governments like those of the Saudis and Egyptians.  But that didnt stop successive administrations from supplying those same autocracies with virtually all the weapons and military aid they claimed they needed, even as Washington maintained an arms embargo on China instituted after Beijing cracked down on the Tiananmen Square protests in June 1989. And when the United States does lift such embargoes, as with Vietnam in 2016, it has everything to do with geopolitics (containing China) and nothing to do with human rights.

The diminished impact of the State Department reflects the diminished state of the department itself. Expect Pompeo to be even more aggressive than Tillerson at de-staffing it through unfilled ambassadorial positions (including South Korea and the European Union), the purging of staff for political reasons, cash buyouts for early retirements, and major reductions at embassies like the new one in Cuba. Among the many top positions that remain unfilled, there arent even nominees for undersecretary for civilian security, democracy, and human rights or assistant secretary for democracy, human rights, and labor (or, for that matter, special envoy on North Korean human rights).  The Trump team proposed slashing the State Department budget by 25% from $53 billion to $39 billion. Congress, however, rebelled and reduced the shrinkage to just 6% in the final budget bill signed by the president last week.  As part of these ostensible austerity measures, Trump wanted to effectively eliminate the bulk of democracy promotion by gutting the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and its associated institutions.

As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump promised to bomb the shit out of the Islamic State and hes been as good as his word. The Trump administration upped the number of aerial attacks against that group without regard for civilian casualties in 2017. Up to 20,000 bombs were, for instance, dropped on ISISs capital, the Syrian city of Raqqa. In one particularly gruesome case, the U.N. has accused the U.S.-led coalition of violating international law by bombing a school building near that city in March 2017, killing 150 people among the displaced families sheltered there. Such acts have only been compounded by the Trump administrations indifference to war crimes committed by the Syrian government and its Russian ally.

Saudi Arabia has been a friend of the United States since the days of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Trump, however, wants to bind Washington and Riyadh even more closely in an anti-Iranian front (an impulse the appointment of Mike Pompeo, a well-known Iranophobe, can only strengthen).  And the Saudi royals were just one entry on a crowded Trumpian list of despots that includes Duterte and Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Ive always had a good instinct about Putin.) Also on the list is Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom Trump praised (We have a great friendship) even as the Turkish leader was throwing journalists in prison and conducting a military campaign against the countrys Kurdish minority. As for his chum Xi, Trump recently eulogized the Chinese president for making himself ruler for life, wistfully regretting that an unnamed American president couldnt do the same.

Soon after, the administration pulled out of a global migration pact that Obama had enthusiastically endorsed the year before. A month later, it cut funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which helps Palestinian refugees, and is now preparing to reduce cooperation with the International Criminal Court. Its biggest target so far, however, has been the U.N. Human Rights Council. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley presented that council with an ultimatum: If it fails to change, then we must pursue the advancement of human rights outside of the council. Although the Council has yet to bend to U.S. demands, Trump and company are undoubtedly uninterested in its reform.  (Washington hasnt even bothered to replace its special representative on the Council.)"
2018-03-13,The Huffington Post,Alex Jones Is Finally Getting The Defamation Lawsuit He Deserves,"A defamation lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Tuesday against the Infowars mouthpiece and others, seeks to stop them from launching the kind of character assassinations against innocent people that have led to real-world harassment campaigns, death threats and other violent episodes.

Jones claim sounds ridiculous because it is. After Gilmores video went viral, Infowars and other far-right outlets latched onto his occupation  he is a foreign service officer with the State Department  as proof that there were high-level CIA and other operatives behind the violence in Charlottesville. As it turns out, white supremacists were behind the rallies, and white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. was allegedly behind the wheel of the car that ran over Heather Heyer. Gilmore just happened to record the killing.

What we now see is a pattern of attacks that politically motivated outlets like Infowars and the Gateway Pundit launch against witnesses and other victims of tragedies, Gilmore said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. They twisted [my] service into a story that I was a deep-state operative who had a role in organizing the violence that we saw in Charlottesville to undermine the Trump administration.

Ever since Jones came after him, Gilmore has been the subject of all sorts of harassment, both physically and online. Hes received death threats and hacking attempts; hes been physically accosted on the street; numerous videos featuring his name have been made about the pseudo-conspiracy; and his parents address was posted online, after which they received an envelope with a powdery residue and a threatening note, according to the lawsuit.

As all of you know, everybody from the Communist Party U.S.A. to five different individuals that have worked directly for Hillary Clinton have filed completely baseless and frivolous lawsuits against Infowars.

Gilmore is suing Jones, Gateway Pundit owner Jim Hoft, former Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) and others for intentionally inflicting emotional distress on him and his family members. His goal, he said, is to deter them from repeating this dangerous pattern of defamation and intimidation.

Whats perhaps most important about this particular lawsuit is that Gilmore and his legal counsel, Georgetown Laws Civil Rights Clinic, dont plan to back down if Infowars offers a settlement, as others have done in the past.

The First Amendment does not and cannot protect deliberate lies designed to incite incessant harassment and violence against private citizens, said Andrew Mendrala, supervising attorney at the Georgetown clinic and Gilmores lawyer. This case is a simple defense of democracy. A well-informed public is essential to a healthy democracy. But a deliberately misinformed public is fatal to it.

Jones is the megaphone through which numerous conspiratorial internet murmurings have been broadcast to the masses. Pick any American tragedy  or, on a slow news day, pick anything  and youll find videos featuring Jones, rabid and red-faced, pushing a paranoid fantasy dreamed up on anonymous forums. According to Jones, the teens who survived the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, are crisis actors; Hillary Clinton is tied to a secret society of pedophiles under a pizza restaurant; juice boxes make your kids gay; the Chobani yogurt company was caught importing migrant rapists; and so much more.

When Jones is caught out, he claims victimhood, apologizes and then relents, often because hes legally bound to do so. He apologized and retracted his Chobani stories as part of a settlement over his claims that the company was importing refugee workers who had raped a child. He apologized for promoting Pizzagate, which had inspired a gunman to enter a Washington, D.C., restaurant and fire a semi-automatic rifle. In a custody battle over his children, Jones lawyer told the court that hes playing a character and is a performance artist, not a raving lunatic.

As all of you know, everybody from the Communist Party U.S.A. to five different individuals that have worked directly for Hillary Clinton have filed completely baseless and frivolous lawsuits against Infowars, he said in a new video about the current suit.

He then went full Alex Jones: Its like Pacific Rim  you know, its a good entertainment movie  they keep sending in the Kaijus to attack. First its every year, then every month. Then its like, OK, now were gonna have five attacks a day. Thats basically what its like. All these lawsuits are run by Hillary lawyers, or people that work for Hillary and the State Department and the CIA. And Julian Assange is in the news from WikiLeaks, whos locked up for years up in his tower, saying Assange warns CIA officers flooding a Democratic Party for 2018 midterms to basically overthrow the country."
2018-11-12,The Huffington Post,Fox News Airs Ad For Trumpy Bear And People On Twitter Arent Sure Its Real,"Viewers of Fox News were given the gift of learning about Trumpy Bear on Monday morning in a campy advertisement shilling a stuffed teddy bear resembling President Donald Trump.

The ad for Trumpy Bear  yes, its the actual name of the product  features a bear with Trumps signature comb-over, white cuffs, a collar and a red tie seated on a motorcycle, riding in a golf cart and even snuggled up in a chair.

Perhaps the most bizarre facet of the bear is that it has a secret pocket that reveals an American flag blanket.

Through a Fox News spokesperson, Fox News senior vice president of eastern sales, Dom Rossi, explained the commercial is a local ad and the network does not do business with them nationally.

Trumpy Bear appears to have been around since at least mid-2017, with similar advertisements to the one that aired on Monday popping up all over YouTube. This latest resurgence, though, has brought people out of the woodwork to ask: Is this real?

Luckily, Snopes did everyone a service by fact-checking the bears existence and informing readers: Trumpy Bear is real. The commercial is real, not a spoof (although some moments appear to have been written with tongue firmly in cheek). And the bear itself is a real product available for purchase.

The reaction to the bear popping up again has been a treat in and of itself:"
2018-11-16,The Huffington Post,These House Committees Could Make Or Break A Progressive Agenda,"It is, all things considered, a pretty good time to be a progressive in the Democratic Party. Progressive ideas about inequality, health care and corporate power have taken hold in the ideological mainstream, and after a decisive midterm election, at least 36 fresh Democrats will arrive in Washington  at least 22 of them new members of what will be the most expansive Congressional Progressive Caucus in history.

But theres more to exercising power in American politics than winning elections. On much of the key strategic jockeying in Washington that matters most, progressives have a history of losing badly. One of the most important arenas now in play is the Byzantine battle for committee assignments: who gets to sit on which panels devoted to crafting legislation. And the outcome of that struggle may well have greater influence on the shape of the partys policy agenda than the higher-profile contests for leadership positions. Bills are written and amended in committee, establishing subjects of political change and setting the scope of legislative debate.

In the past, progressive lawmakers have ceded battles over some of the most powerful committees in Congress to more conservative Democrats. Too often, whats lacking is a strategy, said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a nonprofit devoted to expanding Social Security and Medicare. Our activists or champion members in Congress get bought cheap by promises. Leadership can promise to fight for anything ... and it can even be a sincere promise, but if the committees are stacked with Wall Street people, Wall Street always wins.

Few major pieces of domestic legislation make it through the House without hitting at least one of four ultra-powerful committees: Appropriations, Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, or Financial Services. Appropriations is responsible for government spending. Ways and Means handles tax policy. Financial Services and Energy and Commerce oversee the rules of exchange for everything from prescription drugs to housing to high-speed securities trading. Each panel exercises so much authority that official party rules forbid any member from serving on more than one without obtaining a special waiver from leadership.

Progressives are typically underrepresented on all four of these committees. While making up 40 percent of the current House Democratic roster, members of the CPC account for just 27 percent of the Democratic seats on the House Financial Services Committee, 28 percent of the Energy and Commerce Committee, 31 percent of the Ways and Means Committee, and 36 percent of the Appropriations Committee.

Part of the problem has to do with personalities  young lefty activists dont grow up to be accountants or bank examiners. The most common career path to Congress for serious progressives involves at least a few years as a civil rights attorney, and so 76 percent of the Judiciary Committee is made up of CPC members. Its more fun to serve on a committee with a lot of like-minded members  its easier to get things done on issues like immigration or criminal justice reform. The prospect of battling both Republicans and conservative Democrats over offshore derivatives trading doesnt carry the same allure.

But much of the problem for progressives is about the partys leadership-driven fundraising strategy. Democratic leaders dont restrict lawmakers to one A-list committee for the sake of decentralizing legislative power. They do it to spread the wealth. Ways and Means, Appropriations, Energy and Commerce, and Financial Services are magnets for campaign contributions. Every major corporation in America has something at stake on all of them, and they spend heavily to see their interests represented.

The Progressive Caucus vs. The New Democrat Coalition

The New Democrat Coalition  the traditional intraparty rival of the CPC  is a 68-member crop of self-styled moderates with close ties to the corporate establishment. Much of the New Democrat agenda is defined in opposition to progressive priorities. Theyre against Medicare for all and are sharply critical of the recent Abolish ICE campaign but have devoted much of their legislative energy in recent years to bank deregulation, supporting President Donald Trumps recent rollback of several rules adopted in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

New Democrats know how to play the game. Though the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee is Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), a CPC member, she has to contend with the interests of New Democrats on her panel, who outnumber CPC members 11 to 7. Waters cant just shoot down every bank-friendly bill that New Democrats cook up with Republicans on her committee.

Centrist Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) has been encouraging freshman lawmakers who have pledged their allegiance to the New Democrats cause to pursue seats on the Financial Services Committee, emphasizing the fundraising potential the slots offer his new colleagues, according to multiple sources familiar with his remarks. Gottheimer spokesman Matt Fried denied that the congressman brought up fundraising with other members, calling it a lie. Hed never say that, Fried said.

It isnt a new strategy. New Democrat chair and Financial Services Committee member Jim Himes (D-Conn.) raised over $964,000 from the financial sector for the 2018 cycle alone, part of a $2.3 million haul he secured despite representing a safely blue New England district. Himes turned over $560,000 of this total to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which in turn spends on behalf of Democrats around the country.

On the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), a New Democrat, is trying to oust Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) in a contest to chair the panels subcommittee on international trade. The trade panel is extremely powerful, particularly for its size, with jurisdiction over every industry involved in trade negotiations, from Big Pharma to heavy manufacturing to high finance. Pascrell has put in the work as the ranking member on that subcommittee with Republicans in control, but Kind is trying to gin up support by invoking a rare claim on bizarre rules governing seniority  which is typically an overriding factor in Democratic leadership contests. Though both Pascrell and Kind were sworn in on the same day, Kind is technically more senior  his last name is ahead of Pascrells alphabetically.

This is, of course, ridiculous. Pascrell hasnt received any complaints about his leadership so far, and he sent a letter to his colleagues the day after the election affirming his commitment to remaining the top Democrat on the panel. But it will ultimately be up to the party to decide who stays in charge.

And even this decision depends on further complications. If Kind wants to press Pascrell for the subcommittee gavel, the Ways and Means Committee ultimately gets to decide whether Pascrell should be removed. And we wont know who the members of the Ways and Means Committee are until leadership decides on assignments.

This is not merely a matter of signaling for 2020. The position will play an outsized role in the congressional response to the Trump administrations very real and frequent changes to U.S. trade policy. Kind is an old-school free-trader, an advocate of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization and the failed Trans-Pacific Partnership. That puts him out of step with the party more broadly  just 28 House Democrats voted for TPP in 2018, while 158 opposed it. (Though in another previous, failed vote, the Democratic yeas went as high as 40.)

Its always hard to get new members on powerful committees in a system that rewards seniority, but activists are marshaling arguments. Ocasio-Cortez ousted Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) in a primary  shouldnt she get his Ways and Means Committee seat? Pressley defeated Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.), one of the few reliably progressive votes on the Financial Services Committee, while Omar is replacing one of the others, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). Shouldnt they take over the committee seats, as well?"
2018-11-07,The Huffington Post,Ron DeSantis Beats Andrew Gillum To Become Florida Governor,"Ron DeSantis will be the next Florida governor, extending Republican control of the states highest office to a sixth straight four-year term and proving that a candidacy almost entirely about President Donald Trump can win the top office in a major state.

DeSantis, who was a little-known congressman from the Jacksonville suburbs a year ago, squeaked past Democrat Andrew Gillum in what quickly became a nasty contest with racial overtones and accusations of corruption.

Gillum conceded the race at about 11 p.m., three hours after polls closed in the states Panhandle and after almost all the votes had been counted in heavily Democratic South Florida.

I still believe, I still trust the voters, said Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor, in his concession speech. We may not have all shown up in the way that we thought and hoped that we would. But I still believe that there are still more of us who believe in what is common and what is decent and what is right. And I believe that in the long run good always wins out over evil.

He added, I sincerely regret that I couldnt bring it home for you, but I can guarantee you this: Im not going anywhere. Were going to fight.

Gillum held a small but consistent lead in the available public polling throughout the general election campaign, but Republicans were confident their voter turnout operation  built by former Gov. Jeb Bush and refined over the past decade  would deliver them the necessary votes.

As has become typical in Florida gubernatorial and presidential races in recent years, the final margin is likely to be about 1 percentage point, with DeSantis clinging to a margin of less than 100,000 votes out of nearly 8 million cast.

DeSantis won the GOP nomination as the proud acolyte of Trump and basically nothing else. Other candidates in both parties took the traditional path of making visits to county fairs, local party dinners and civic groups to build up support across the state. DeSantis, though, essentially ran his campaign from the Fox News studio near the Capitol, appearing several times a week to defend Trump on issues ranging from the Russia investigation to the promised border wall.

Those performances endeared DeSantis with Republican primary voters in Florida who watch Fox regularly, but they did little to improve the congressmans name recognition among independent voters and did nothing to hone his positions on Florida-specific issues.

It turns out that did not matter. DeSantis offered few specifics on how he would govern Florida, other than to say he would continue the economic policies of current GOP Gov. Rick Scott with low taxes and few regulations.

DeSantis victory continues the drought for Democrats seeking Floridas highest office that started in 1998 when Bush defeated Buddy MacKay, who had been Lawton Chiles lieutenant governor. Chiles was the last Democrat to win the states highest office. He defeated Bush in 1994 to win a second term, and died days before he was to leave office."
2018-02-10,The Huffington Post,Trump Blocks Release Of Democrats Rebuttal To GOP FISA Memo,"WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump blocked the release of a memo written by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee as a rebuttal to allegations from their Republican counterparts that the FBI abused surveillance laws to improperly spy on the Trump campaign.

In a letter to the House Intelligence Committee on Friday, White House counsel Don McGahn said that while the president is inclined to declassify the memo, he will not at this time due to it containing numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages.

The White House also shared a letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray expressing concern about the release of certain parts of the memo. The letter came in response to McGahns request for the FBI and DOJ to review the Democratic memo, and argued that certain passages sparked concern about the protection of intelligence sources and methods, ongoing investigations and other sensitive information.

The House Intelligence Committee voted to release the Democrats memo on Monday, days after the Republicans version became public. The Republicans on the committee blocked the Democrats memo from being released simultaneously.

The GOP memo  which alleges liberal bias among mostly Republican law enforcement officials at the Justice Department and FBI  was part of a long-standing effort by the presidents allies to undermine special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Trump, who has characterized Muellers investigation as a witch hunt, tweeted on Saturday that the memo totally vindicates him.

The Republicans memo, drafted by staffers in the office of committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a member of Trumps transition team, accuses law enforcement officials of misleading a secretive court that approves surveillance warrants when they applied for permission to spy on former Trump campaign official Carter Page.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, slammed the Republican memo as misleading and factually incorrect. He said in a statement last week that his partys response would provide missing context that would refute Republicans claims.

Several of the allegations in the Nunes memo are already falling apart. One of the key complaints in the memo is that the FBI failed to disclose that a dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele was funded by Democratic operatives looking for information on Trump during the campaign. But three days after the memo was released, Nunes conceded that the FBI had disclosed the political origins of the Steele dossier in a footnote on its application to spy on Page.

Nunes memo also claimed that Andrew McCabe, then deputy director of the FBI, told the House Intelligence Committee last December that the agency wouldnt have sought a surveillance warrant without the Steele dossier. Nunes staff purposefully mischaracterizes McCabes testimony in the memo, a senior Democratic committee official told HuffPost."
2018-10-01,The Huffington Post,Donald Trump Calls Media Loco While Discussing US-Mexico Trade Deal,"Trump made a massive and costly border wall a central part of his presidential campaign and insisted that Mexico will pay for it. Mexican leaders have repeatedly said their country will not pay for such a wall.

His administration has enforced numerous policies that hurt people from Mexico and South and Central American countries, including ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and routinely separating migrant families at the border.

Trump frequently makes off-the-cuff comments, like his loco remark, that come across as tone deaf at best and blatantly racist at worst.

In January he reportedly described Haiti and African nations as shithole countries and slammed the idea of renewing protections for immigrants from those regions.

Trump also has a tendency of referring to racial groups as monoliths.

Ill take jobs back from China. Ill take jobs back from Japan, he said during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in 2015. The Hispanics are going to get those jobs, and theyre going to love Trump.

I love the Muslims. I think theyre great people, he said during his campaign regarding whether he would be willing to name a Muslim person to his Cabinet.

I have a great relationship with the blacks, Trump said in April 2011. Ive always had a great relationship with the blacks."
2018-07-16,The Huffington Post,Few Trump-Russia Stories Have Changed Americans Minds Will This One,"As news from the probes into Russian meddling in U.S. politics continues to accumulate, public opinion on President Donald Trumps relationship with Russia has remained basically the same. Americans have been more likely than not to be troubled by the way the White House deals with the country, but the concerns havent been growing.

If anything could change Americans minds, it might be expected to be the joint news conference Trump held Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Trump parried a question about holding Russia accountable for the poor relationship between the countries by insisting that the U.S. had been foolish and shared the blame for the acrimony. He also undercut the U.S. intelligence community by declining to back their assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

Even before the meeting, most Americans disliked Putin, while saying they believed Trump took a more positive view of him. Recent Fox News polling found that roughly a third of Republican voters wanted Trump to be tougher on Russia. And following the Trump-Putin summit and news conference on Monday, a handful of GOP politicians and conservative pundits criticized Trumps performance.

But this isnt the first time that Trump has faced intra-party criticism for his handling of Russia, and in the past that hasnt translated into major repercussions from his base. If what happened in Helsinki changes the U.S. publics attitudes about Trump and his relationship with Russia, even temporarily, itll be one of only a few events among a constant stream of developments to have done so.

A series of congressional hearings last year didnt do much to change opinions, HuffPost/YouGov polling found. Neither did an earlier meeting between Putin and Trump, or the release of emails confirming that Trumps eldest son met with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign, or former Trump adviser Michael Flynns guilty plea to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials.

A lot of Trump-era polling, including the presidents approval rating, has so far proven to be both notably stable and notably politicized. Even as special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian meddling has progressed, public opinion has remained largely, although not entirely, calcified along political llnes. The presidents opponents have mostly thought from Day One that it was a massive scandal. A majority, though not all, of his supporters remain generally unconvinced that its much of an issue.

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll, conducted after Fridays indictment of 12 Russian hackers but before Mondays summit, finds more of the same. In polls dating back to last March, the share of the public who call Trumps relationship with Russia a legitimate issue has vacillated between 42 percent and 50 percent. In the most recent, Americans say, 45 percent to 29 percent, that its a legitimate issue.

The 46 percent of Americans who currently consider the Trump administrations relationship with Russia at least a somewhat serious problem is virtually identical to the 47 percent who said the same when HuffPost first asked the question in March 2017. The 32 percent who call it a very serious problem is identical. (Recent polling from other outlets including Fox News and Monmouth University has found, if anything, a slight dip in support for the Russia probe.)

Even in the wake of Fridays indictments, the 59 percent who say in the HuffPost/YouGov poll that its probably or definitely true that Russia hacked Democrats emails to help Trumps election chances is basically unmoved from the 57 percent who said so last December.

Trumps opponents are notably more vehement than his supporters in their focus on the Russia story. Contrast the 78 percent of Hillary Clinton voters who view the matter as a legitimate issue with the 59 percent of Trump voters who say outright that its not (22 percent of Trump voters also think its legitimate, while another 19 percent say theyre not sure). Seventy-one percent of Clinton voters consider Trumps handling of Russia to present a very serious problem, compared to the 57 percent of Trump voters who dont believe its a problem at all.

Non-voters, while perhaps the most likely to have malleable opinions on the subject, remain largely tuned out. Thirty-one percent of Americans who didnt vote in 2016 say that theyve heard nothing at all in the news recently about Trump and Russia, compared to just 6 percent of either Clinton or Trump voters who say the same.

2018-05-02,The Huffington Post,Lobbyist Friend Helped Scott Pruitt Plan 100000 Trip To Morocco Reports,"The disclosure raises fresh questions about the purpose of Pruitts controversial visit, which reportedly cost taxpayers more than $100,000. Some also question whether the lobbyist, reportedly hired soon after the trip by the Moroccan government to promote the countrys cultural and economic interests, benefited financially from his relationship to the embattled EPA chief.

The New York Times and The Washington Post separately reported that Richard Smotkin, a former Comcast lobbyist who has known Pruitt for many years, helped to plan the EPA administrators trip to Morocco in December. Both papers published articles online Tuesday night and in Wednesdays print editions.

The EPA confirmed that Smotkin facilitated an initial meeting in October between Pruitt and Moroccos ambassador to the U.S., reported the Post. It was at that meeting that the ambassador, Lalla Joumala, invited Pruitt to visit Morocco.

Smotkin reportedly then helped organize several meetings for Pruitt in the country, including one with OCP Group, a state-owned phosphate mining company. Smotkin was a near-constant presence during Pruitts trip, the Post reported, serving as an informal liaison at both official and social events.

The EPA did not deny that Smotkin had attended some of Pruitts meetings in Morocco, but downplayed the role that the lobbyist played in orchestrating the visit.

EPAs Office of International and Tribal Affairs organized and led the effort around Administrator Pruitts official meetings with the Moroccan government, EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a statement Tuesday, according to the Times. Additionally, Mr. Smotkin did not attend or participate in any official meetings with the Moroccan government.

Still, concerns have been raised about Smotkins involvement in the trip, with the two reports pointing out how unusual it is for a person outside government to arrange travel plans for a Cabinet official.

The Times noted that Pruitt has done this at least once before since becoming the head of the EPA. Pruitt reportedly recruited another friend, Leonard Leo, head of the Federalist Society, to help him plan his trip to Italy last June.

Smotkin recently signed a $40,000-a-month lobbying contract with the Moroccan government to craft an outreach program that includes helping to promote the country as a film and world-class golf destination. Documents filed with the Department of Justice in April show that Smotkins work with the Moroccan government began Jan. 1  just weeks after Pruitts visit.

Larry Noble, senior director at the Campaign Legal Center, told the Post that Smotkins role in Pruitts trip raises questions about whether the visit helped the lobbyist get his new job with the Moroccan government. Public officials are prohibited under federal law from using their position to financially benefit their friends and relatives.

It shows, at the very least, a tremendous amount of sloppiness, and it raises ethical issues about the relationship between Smotkin and Pruitt, Noble said. If Pruitt did this to benefit Smotkin and did this to show that Smotkin has an in with the EPA administrator, then hes using his official office to benefit a private person.

Pruitts Morocco trip had already been drawing criticism and scrutiny from lawmakers and others. Last week, members of two congressional oversight committees quizzed Pruitt on choices hed made as the head of the EPA, including the purpose of the Morocco visit and why hed spent part of his time in the country promoting U.S. liquefied natural gas.

I cant, for the life of me, imagine why an EPA administrator would be over there promoting energy sales, Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), a member of the House Appropriations subcommittee, said to Pruitt on Thursday.

The high cost of the four-day trip has also attracted scrutiny. (The Post reported on Tuesday that the visit cost more than $100,000  more than double what had previously been reported.)

Pruitt has defended the trip as being part of an effort to negotiate the environmental chapter of a new bilateral trade agreement between Morocco and the United States. As for his promotion of liquefied natural gas, he told lawmakers last week that hed only done that because the Moroccan ambassador had asked him to discuss the topic while he was in the country."
2018-02-25,The Huffington Post,Tweeters Barf Over Sweepstake Prize Of Dinner With Donald Trump,"The Republican National Committee used Twitter to promote a prize of attending a dinner with President Donald Trump.

But many people replied to the Saturday tweet by saying theyd rather go hungry than attend the RNCs Annual Spring Retreat Dinner in Palm Beach, Florida, in March with Trump.

The RNC linked to a GOP.com fundraising page with its post.

It offered one person the chance to win transportation, accommodation and a ticket to the Florida bash, and invited people to donate to the RNC in exchange for entry into the sweepstake. The small print, however, contained another link which allowed people to enter before 11:59 p.m. ET on Sunday for free.

The RNC valued the prize at $3,000, but some folks on Twitter barfed at the offer:

2018-11-15,The Huffington Post,Trump Names Mar-A-Lago Member And Handbag Designer As Ambassador,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced his intention to nominate Lana Marks, a luxury handbag designer, as the U.S. ambassador to South Africa. She is also a member of the presidents exclusive Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, multiple outlets reported.

Marks has no prior diplomatic experience. She was born and raised in South Africa and, according to the White House, speaks Afrikaans and Xhosa, two languages spoken in the nation.

The post, which requires Senate approval, has been vacant since former Ambassador Patrick Gaspard resigned in 2016.

Marks launched her eponymous handbag label after she was unable to locate a red alligator handbag to match the suit she planned to wear aboard the royal yacht Britannia for Queen Elizabeth IIs birthday celebration in 1984, according to her website.

Previously, in the late 1970s, she sought to qualify for the French Open tennis tournament.

Her accessories brand specializes in bags cut from exotic materials including alligator, ostrich and lizard. They typically retail for five-figure sums  although one red-carpet creation was priced at $400,000  and she counts among her fans celebrities such as Madonna, Helen Mirren and Sarah Jessica Parker, according to her site.

But Marks is also known for stiffing those who work for her, the Palm Beach Daily News reported last month when rumors of the impending appointment cropped up. She has been accused of underpaying attorneys, accountants, landlords and employees, the outlet stated, and is involved in a legal battle with her siblings over the care of their elderly mother.

In a statement, the White House said she has served on the Womens Leadership Board at the Harvard Kennedy School, which works to improve gender equality around the world. Marks is not currently listed as a member on the boards website.

Trump has granted administrative roles to other Mar-a-Lago members, naming friend (and huge supporter) Robin Bernstein as ambassador to the Dominican Republic last year. Bernstein was confirmed in July. Three other Mar-a-Lago insiders have been instrumental in shaping the Trump administrations Veterans Affairs policies, ProPublica reported in August."

On Tuesdays broadcast of The Late Late Show, host James Corden reflected on last weeks deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

Although these types of mass shootings have become normal in this country, theyre not normal at all for the rest of the planet, Corden said.

He noted how historic measures that were enacted in the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan demonstrated that stricter gun laws can make a difference in reducing mass shootings.

Corden also said he felt optimistic that perhaps this time, things will be different. He praised the teen survivors of the Parkland massacre for speaking out about their ordeal and for organizing a march on March 24 in Washington, D.C. to call for gun law reform.

2018-10-16,The Huffington Post,GOP Senate Candidate In Michigan Admits Terrible Error For Showing Swastika In Ad,"DETROIT (AP)  Republican U.S. Senate candidate John James of Michigan said Monday he made a terrible error by inadvertently showing a swastika in his campaigns first TV ad of the general election.

The ad began airing two weeks ago and already was being phased out for a new one, James said, when a left-leaning blog and then the liberal advocacy group Progress Michigan brought attention to the image on Monday. It is briefly shown on a bulletin board in a school hallway while James talks off-screen about failing schools. He said the scene is from stock footage.

I need to fess up and admit this was a terrible error on our part, James, a businessman and military veteran, said during a news conference that was held at his campaign headquarters in the Detroit suburb of Livonia hours after he and Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow met for a debate. We should have caught this error and we didnt, and theres no excuse. Im responsible for everything that our team does and fails to do, and I will do everything in my power to make sure this never, ever happens again.

Lonnie Scott, executive director of Progress Michigan, said ensuring that symbols of hate speech and genocide are not in political ads should be a pretty basic thing to figure out.

His team is either too lazy to spot check their ads or theyre willfully pushing out this type of imagery, he said. Either way, its a problem and shows James lack of preparedness for the United States Senate.

James, who is black, said implying that he supports racism is an indication of how low people are willing to go to get Stabenow re-elected to a fourth term.

I absolutely do not approve of hatred or bigotry in any form, he said."
2018-02-09,The Huffington Post,Nashville Mayor Megan Barry Under Investigation For Affair With Former Bodyguard,"Nashville Mayor Megan Barry is facing an investigation after admitting last week to having an affair with the former head of her security detail, Metropolitan Nashville Police Department Sgt. Robert Forrest.

On Tuesday, the Nashville City Council approved the establishment of a special committee to determine if the mayor misused public funds (which is a crime in Tennessee) as a result of the affair.

Per the Tennessean, Forrest accompanied Barry on 19 trips for city-related business between January and October 2017 at a cost of more than $30,000. Records show that on nine of the trips, including a seven-day visit to Athens, Greece, Forrest was Barrys sole companion.

The mayor is also facing an ethics complaint speculating that her affair with Forrest may have factored into her decision not to support a civilian review board of the force.

The mayors office released a statement earlier this week welcoming any investigation into the affair and disputing claims that the mayor may have misspent money on travel.

Mayor Barry has never sought reimbursement for meals or other expenses related to travel, Barrys communications director, Sean Braisted, said in a statement. She has never sought to financially benefit from any of the travel she has taken on behalf of the city. We believe that at no time did Mayor Barry or Sgt. Forrest ever attempt to use taxpayer dollars to support their extramarital affair.

I just want to make it right, Barry told Nashvilles NewsChannel 5 in an interview Thursday. Whatever right looks like for the citizens.

In a statement issued through his lawyer last week, Forrester apologized to his family for his extramarital relationship, but denied any wrongdoing during his time as an officer.

I deeply regret that my professional relationship with Mayor Barry turned into a personal one, he said in the statement. This has caused great pain for my wife, my family, friends and colleagues. At no time did I ever violate my oath as a police officer or engage in actions that would abuse the public trust."
2018-03-18,The Huffington Post,Democrats Flood Andrew McCabe With Federal Job Offers To Save His Pension,"Democrats in Congress may have found a way to save former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabes government pension, despite Attorney General Jeff Sessions firing him two days before he could qualify for it.

Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) on Saturday extended a federal job offer to McCabe, who has worked for the FBI for 21 years. Pocan wants McCabe to work with his office on election security.

Should McCabe accept the offer, Pocan said in a statement it would allow the former FBI official to reach the length of service he needs to retire and collect his pension, estimated at $60,000 a year.

The congressman claims Sessions ousting of McCabe proves that President Donald Trump and his administration are working to discredit the FBI and undermine Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into whether Trumps presidential campaign colluded with Russia.

While Speaker Ryan and House Republicans have become complicit in the Presidents destruction of our democracy, we must do all that we can to ensure that the investigation into Russias interference in our election is completed and that future elections are safeguarded from these kinds of attacks, Pocan said.

Sessions ousted McCabe on Friday after the FBIs Office of Professional Responsibility recommended he be fired for his alleged lack of candor during an internal review of how the FBI and Justice Department handled an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

While Trump has accused McCabe of having a political bias in favor of Hillary Clinton, the Justice Departments internal review reportedly says McCabe authorized a discussion between FBI officials and a Wall Street Journal reporter for an Oct. 30, 2016 story, which included details damaging to Clintons presidential campaign.

McCabe abruptly announced he was leaving the FBI in January, amid the Justice Departments internal investigation. He was using accrued leave to stay on the FBIs payroll until his retirement date on Sunday, his 50th birthday.

In a statement on Saturday, Pocan called his proposal to McCabe a legitimate offer, adding: Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of American democracy and both Republicans and Democrats should be concerned about election integrity.

The offer came in response to a tweet from NBC News Andrea Mitchell, who suggested that a friendly member of Congress hire McCabe so he could qualify for pension benefits by extending his service the extra days.

Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) offered McCabe a position in his office as special senior staff attorney assisting the House Judiciary Committee, while Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.) told McCabe to call him on Monday for a federal job.

A former federal official familiar with retirement rules told the Washington Post that McCabes federal job offers, even if the roles only last a few days, could save his pension benefits.

Andrew McCabe: I have the need to hire a Special Senior Staff Attorney to help me with my work on the House Judiciary Committee dealing with threats to the Constitution and the rule of law in America. You're perfect for the job. DM me.  Rep. Jamie Raskin (@RepRaskin) March 17, 2018

In 2017, Trump reportedly called McCabe into his office for a meeting, then asked him which candidate he voted for in the presidential election, according to the Washington Post. Former and current U.S. officials told the Post the conversation between Trump and McCabe is of interest to Mueller and his investigation.

In an apparent attack on McCabes leading role in the FBIs investigation into the Clinton Foundation, Trump also publicly speculated that McCabes wife Jill McCabe, a Democrat, received money from Clinton Puppets, during her unsuccessful 2015 run for a Virginia state Senate seat.

Trump was apparently referencing a donation of up to $675,000 from Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffes political action committee, though the donation was made before McCabe was promoted to deputy director.

The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBIs involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes.  Nothing was further from the truth.  In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed."
2018-11-12,The Huffington Post,2018 Midterms A Referendum On Much More Than Donald Trump,"Midterm elections are usually thought of as a referendum on the president. But for many Americans, the 2018 midterms were a referendum on so much more. When she sat down with WNYCs Kai Wright, HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen called this election cycle a referendum on our character as a nation. And as with the many pending results around the nation, the results of the referendum, Polgreen said, feel too close to call.

Polgreen and Wright sat down for a roundtable discussion on the midterms for an episode of The United States of Anxiety podcast. They were joined by Kelly Dittmar of The Center for American Women and Politics and conservative columnist Mona Charen. Charen, who joked that she has been in a clinical depression since the Trump campaign started gaining momentum in 2015, disclosed that the 2018 midterms brought with them a milestone: she cast her first vote for a democratic candidate. But that doesnt mean she doesnt still consider herself a republican. Theres a big [political] middle in the country that is dissatisfied with all of the choices on offer and I guess Im in that basket now, Charen said.

In the second half of the episode, listen to an intimate conversation between lifelong activist Dolores Huerta and her daughter, Juana. Raised in Stockton, California, 88-year-old Dolores has made a career of publicly fighting for the rights of others. Along with Cesar Chavez, she helped to found the United Farm Workers Union and became iconic for her rallying cry si se puede! She was instrumental in organizing the Delano grape strike and boycott of the 1960s that demanded equal wages and better working conditions for the mostly Latino and Filipino farm workers.

Juana is a former Los Angeles public school teacher who now works at the Dolores Huerta Foundation. Juana interviews her mom about her experiences with gender and power both in her work as an activist in a predominantly male-led union, and at home.

This episode was produced in partnership with , a weekly Latino news and culture program from NPR and the Futuro Media Group."
2018-05-29,The Huffington Post,Michigans Medicaid Bill Is A Case Study In How America Makes Racist Policy,"The Republican state Senator in Michigan wanted people on Medicaid to work in order to keep their benefits, but not if they live in counties with high unemployment. He thought it was ridiculous that anyone would call his plan racist.

Dont tell me that somebody living in the city of Detroit isnt closer to services and potential jobs in Wayne County than people living in a northern Michigan county are, he said. The distances from them to potential jobs are far greater and the services are far fewer.

In defending his proposal, Shirkey seemed to be asking for an exemption of another kind: You cant call his policy racist if its race-neutral in design. But his bill fits a longstanding pattern in America whereby Jim Crow policies get smuggled through the back door, under the cover of euphemism. African-Americans have been systematically shorted on government benefits since the early 20th century through policy variances that were not explicitly racist in intent but had a disparate racial impact in practice.

Take the exclusion of farmworkers and maids from various New Deal programs in the 1930s, including the Social Security Acts retirement insurance. Ostensibly it was too difficult to collect the needed payroll taxes from agriculture and domestic workers since they didnt punch the clock in the same way as people in factories.

It just so happened that farmworkers and maids represented 65 percent of the black labor force at the time. Policymakers may not have had an identifiably racist intent, but African-American workers were disproportionately omitted from what is often called the most effective poverty-reducing program in U.S. history.

The exclusion of so many black Americans from the bounty of public policy, and the way in which these important, large-scale national programs were managed, launched new and potent sources of racial inequality, Ira Katznelson, a Columbia University political historian, wrote in his 2005 book When Affirmative Action Was White. The federal government, though seemingly race-neutral, functioned as a commanding instrument of white privilege.

In an article on the decision to initially exclude farmworkers and maids that the Social Security Administration promotes on its website, public historian Larry DeWitt argued that hearing transcripts and committee reports indicate administrative difficulty was the only reason  essentially because nobody explicitly said the goal was to exclude black people.

The occupational carveouts can be found throughout the laws of the New Deal. Occasionally the mask slipped, and the real purpose was laid bare. In reference to the exclusion of agricultural workers from the Fair Labor Standards Act, for instance, Rep. James Mark Wilcox (D-Fla.) insisted on maintaining wage differences between white and black workers.

There has always been a difference in the wage scale of white and colored labor. So long as Florida people are permitted to handle the matter, the delicate and perplexing problem can be adjusted; but the Federal Government knows no color line and of necessity it cannot make any distinction between the races. We may rest assured, therefore, that when we turn over to a federal bureau or board the power to fix wages, it will prescribe the same wage for the Negro that it prescribes for the white man. Now, such a plan might work in some sections of the United States but those of us who know the true situation know that it just will not work in the South. You cannot put the Negro and the white man on the same basis and get away with it.

Around the time of the New Deal, Southern Democrats in Congress, a shrinking but pivotal voting bloc, also protected the racial order of the Southern status quo by insisting on state and local administration of federal programs whenever possible. While the programs themselves might not have mentioned race, their administration was left to local officials  bureaucrats, bank officers, Veterans Affairs staffers  who were more or less free to discriminate as they wished. In the early years of food assistance, for instance, state and local officials could decide whether to provide assistance in a given county. The result: black babies starving to death.

States still administer food stamps and Medicaid  two of the biggest federal antipoverty programs  but within much narrower federal guidelines. Republicans have consistently supported efforts to give states more leeway, a strategy that in the 1990s sharply curtailed cash welfare for single mothers. States with large African-American populations are now likelier to have stricter Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs.

Shirkey was the lead author of the proposal in Michigan. He included a carveout for people in counties with unemployment above 8.5 percent. It would have exempted residents of 17 mostly-white counties, according to one Michigan-based think tanks analysis, but not populous cities like Detroit that have high unemployment and are mostly African-American.

There are laws on the books now designed to address measures like Shirkeys. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits procedures, criteria or methods of administration that appear neutral but have a discriminatory effect on individuals, as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Medicaid, says on its website. Had Shirkeys original bill passed, as Nicholas Bagley and Eli Savit point out in The New York Times, Michigan wouldve needed an HHS waiver that might well have fallen apart under legal scrutiny."
2018-11-01,The Huffington Post,Defense Secretary Mattis On Doubling Troops At The Border We Dont Do Stunts,"Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday denied accusations that the Trump administration was deploying 5,200 troops to the Mexican border as a political stunt to bolster Republican support for the Nov. 6 midterm elections.

While taking questions from the press after a meeting with South Koreas national defense minister, Mattis rejected the accusation and said that the Department of Defense doesnt do stunts.

Trump administration officials announced Monday that the additional troops would be deployed to join the estimated 2,100 National Guard troops that are already at the U.S.-Mexico border to assist with the approaching migrant caravan making its way from Honduras.

The total number of troops deployed at the border will be more than double the estimated 3,500 people currently marching in the caravan. According to The Wall Street Journal, there will be more troops deployed to the border than there are currently serving in Iraq and Syria.

When asked by a reporter whether the deployment was a political stunt, Mattis pointed out the additional troops were a request from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The support that we provide to the secretary of Homeland Security is tactical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police, Mattis said. So we dont do stunts in this department, thank you.

Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2018

Without providing proof, Trump has claimed at his political rallies and on Twitter that there are bad people traveling in the Central American caravan, including people who are in gangs, who are trying to invade the U.S.

However, the caravan is filled mostly with Honduran, Guatemalan and Salvadoran migrants, including many women and children, who are hoping to apply for asylum at the U.S. border. The caravan originated in San Pedro Sula in Honduras, which has earned a reputation of being one of the most violent places in Central America.

Earlier this week, Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, also denied that deploying the troops was a politically motivated decision."
2018-09-24,The Huffington Post,Brett Kavanaugh On Fox News Im Not Going Anywhere,"Kavanaugh, alongside his wife, Ashley, continued to deny the sexual assault allegations against him in an exclusive interview with Martha MacCallum. In a teaser clip released by Fox News, the judge said he was not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process.

Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, claimed Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party when they were teenagers more than 35 years ago. A second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, told The New Yorker that she believes Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale party.

White House aide Bill Shine has reportedly been handling Kavanaughs media strategy as President Donald Trump continues to publicly support his nominee. Shine began working for the White House after being ousted as co-president of Fox News over the networks handling of its own sexual harassment claims.

Were looking for a fair process, where I can be heard and defend my integrity, my lifelong record of promoting dignity and equality for women, starting with the women who knew me when I was 14 years old, Kavanaugh said in the clip. Im not going anywhere.

Blasey sent a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) detailing her allegations against Kavanaugh in July, asking to remain anonymous for fear of backlash. Information about the 51-year-old psychologists letter leaked to the media, and Blasey eventually came forward publicly with her story.

Blasey claims that Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and attempted to take off her clothes during a high school party when they were teenagers. She alleges that Kavanaugh was drunk at the time and only stopped after a classmate threw himself on top of them, giving her a chance to run away.

MacCallum didnt ask Kavanaugh about the person Blasey said had interrupted the alleged assault, Mark Judge. Judge sent a statement to the Senate committee claiming he did not remember the incident and did not wish to speak on the matter publicly.

Kavanaugh told MacCallum he had never been drunk enough to misremember or forget any of his actions. Judge, however, wrote an entire memoir about being blackout drunk in high school. In Judges book, Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk, he references a Bart OKavanaugh who vomited in a car and passed out on his way back from a party.

Though her request for an FBI investigation has been denied, Blasey has agreed to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Kavanaugh did not answer MacCallums question about whether he wanted an FBI investigation, even after consistently saying he wanted a fair process to clear his name.

Ramirez is the second woman to publicly come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. She alleges that he pulled down his pants and thrust his penis in her face at a Yale party during the 1983-84 school year. Ramirez says both she and Kavanaugh were intoxicated at the time and that she isnt entirely sure of her memories.

The New Yorker, which first published Ramirezs account Sunday, was not able to independently confirm if Kavanaugh was at the Yale party she described, but interviewed several of Ramirezs classmates, who recalled hearing about the alleged incident in vague terms.

James Roche, who was Kavanaughs roommate at the time of the alleged Yale incident, told The New Yorker that he recalled Kavanaugh to be frequently, incoherently drunk. Another former classmate who chose to remain anonymous told The New Yorker he believed Ramirezs claims and described Kavanaugh as someone who was relatively shy who could become aggressive and even belligerent when he drank alcohol."
2018-03-28,The Huffington Post,Joe Biden Regrets Talk Of Fighting Trump Doesnt Want To Get Down In Mosh Pit,"Still, Biden used the podcast to stress that one of the passions of my life is violence against women, and reiterated that he found Trumps rhetoric vulgar.

Men have an obligation not to engage in degrading talk, he said. I think what it does, it does encourage the minority element of a male population that its okay to engage in the behavior the president talks about.

Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct  including harassment, assault and rape  by 21 women, though he vehemently denies the allegations.

Its important to continue to make the point that women are entitled to be treated with respect, damn it. Its about time we men stand up. Weve got to be part of the solution, Biden said.

For what its worth, according to a survey from Public Policy Polling, 37 percent of voters think Biden could take Trump in a fist fight, with 32 percent putting their money on Trump and 30 percent having no opinion.

2018-11-05,The Huffington Post,Propaganda and Disinformation Target Muslim Candidates During Midterms,"KEREM YUCEL via Getty Images Ilhan Omar, a Muslim Somali-American running for Minnesotas 5th Congressional District, campaigns at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis on Nov. 2. An October report from Muslim Advocates found dozens of candidates nationwide who ran on anti-Muslim platforms.

Aisha Yaqoob is American Muslim hijab-wearing woman who is the 2018 Democratic candidate for the 97th District in the Georgia House of Representatives. The daughter of immigrants, Yaqoob, 25, is one of the nearly 90 Muslims running for public office nationwide. But facing that unprecedented number of Muslim candidates running in the midterms are perhaps the most Islamophobic U.S. elections ever. She is one of those candidates who face such hate, particularly on her social media pages.

The Islamophobic harassment, however, wasnt always such a pressing concern. Only after her photo and social media pages were posted on a right-wing website this year did the wave of Islamophobic hate came crashing in.

But the hateful comments didnt have anything to do with Yaqoobs stances on the issues she promoted, she said; rather, they always referred to her faith and racial identity. The online critics told her to go back to her country and accused her of bringing Sharia, or Islamic law, to the United States.

Its not even about my platforms. Its literally just about who I am, she told HuffPost. [My campaign] had to spend a lot of time and a lot of money, frankly, just making sure that people knew who I was before we even got the chance to start to talk about issues or ask for their vote.

The use of anti-Muslim bigotry in political campaigns is not new, but new research by the Information Disorder Lab at the Harvard Kennedy Schools Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy released last week outlined the various propaganda tactics right-wing websites and activists utilized to target and smear Muslim candidates.

The goals of such campaigns is to primarily see Muslim candidates lose their elections, said Stefanie Le, a researcher at IDLab. These right-wing websites are doing so by otherizing these candidates and appealing to the fears that have been stoked in the political climate, she added.

The findings list the five most common tactics used to target Muslim candidates in 2018 races. The most common tactic recorded by the research center was falsely accusing Muslim candidates of having ties to terrorism and extremism. One such example can be found in Minnesota, where Muslim Democratic candidate Ilhan Omar is running for Minnesotas 5th Congressional District.

In her heavily Democratic district, Omar, a former Somali refugee, is poised to be one of the first Muslim women and the first Somali-American in Congress. Muslims currently hold only two of the 535 seats in Congress.

Despite her qualifications and like Yaqoob, Omar is constantly attacked on various websites, including in her district, where local GOP members set up a site and leveled a litany of false accusations against her. The site called her dangerous, accused her of aiding terrorists and said she broke immigration laws  allegations that she has denied and that various media investigations have disproved.

The report also lists other tactics used to target Muslim candidates, such as coordinating smear campaigns, exaggerating scandals involving Muslim candidates that are then echoed on conservative news sites and social media channels, and guilt by association, which targets non-Muslim candidates who work alongside Muslim candidates.

Such tactics are in line with the rising Islamophobia seen in politics and beyond. Last month a report from Muslim Advocates documented dozens of candidates nationwide who ran on anti-Muslim platforms, such as claiming that Muslims want to take over the U.S. government."
2018-08-23,The Huffington Post,Trump If I Ever Got Impeached I Think The Market Would Crash,"If I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, Trump told Fox News. I think everybody would be very poor. Because without this thinking you would see, you would see numbers that you wouldnt believe in reverse.

On Tuesday, Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty on charges of tax evasion and bank fraud. Also on Tuesday, Trumps personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to 8 counts of illegal campaign contributions made at the direction of a candidate for federal office. These campaign violations involve payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, women who claim to have had affairs with Trump.

As a result, some see the likelihood of Trumps impeachment increasing. On political prediction site PredictIt, the odds of a Trump impeachment hit a three-month high, with the current odds of it happening by the end of 2019 sitting at 37 percent and the probability of it happening sometime within his first term at 45 percent.

Volatility is far from a sure thing

But Wall Street experts like JPMorgans John Normand arent convinced that a bumpy presidency would mean trouble for markets, saying that to think a Trump impeachment would derail the markets seems hasty.

Fiscal stimulus, which has been the most-material driver of this years step up in US growth and corporate earnings, would not be reversed if the mid-term elections delivered a Democratic Congress, an impeachment process or eventually a guilty verdict, Normand wrote in a note to clients. Neither has the Trump Administration been proposing a deregulatory agenda comparable to Reagan and Clintons that requires legislation to deliver transformational change. The agenda is advancing more through personnel, priorities, rules and executive orders, which are important at the sectoral level (Financials, Energy) but not at the macroeconomic one. Thus, rethinking the direction of the economy or financial markets on the prospects for less deregulation under a preoccupied or a different President seems hasty.

Certainly, theres a case to be made that markets would nevertheless experience volatility in the near-term. However, there are bigger things out there driving the market in the long run.

Perhaps there is a tactical case for reducing overweights in Equities versus Bonds this Fall, on a view that a high P/E market is typically vulnerable to drawdown before an event risk, Normand added. But the case for strategically underweighting stocks or shifting to long duration is poor unless one believes that prospects for US growth, earnings and the Fed in 2019 rest on this aspect of domestic politics.

What about Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton?

In the note, Normand emphasized that impeachment is a process rather than an event, involving several judicial and institutional phases. And while there have been past examples of disgraced presidencies, they need to be examined individually.

Normand noted that Nixons impeachment process began shortly after the First Oil Shock in late 1973 that resulted in recession and rising inflation. Nixon resigned in August 1974. Elsewhere, Clintons impeachment in December 1998 was  almost a non-event for the markets as stocks and credit had already experienced the Asian Crisis, the Russian default, and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management that summer.

If, at some point, Trumps Presidency ends prematurely like Nixons, the lingering question for EM  or at least the China complex  will be whether the new boss Vice President Pence will be the same as the old boss."
2018-06-12,The Huffington Post,The Las Vegas Union That Learned To Beat The House,"Martin S Fuentes for HuffPost Monie Stewart-Cariaga has worked at the Paris Hotel and Casino for 18 years. She's now a shop steward, helping other cocktail servers navigate problems on the job.

That wasnt always the case for the Culinary. When Richard Blair, 63, was working in a kitchen at the Dunes in the 1980s, he didnt even know he had a shop steward. But as the union transformed into a more bottom-up operation over the years  much of that under Taylors leadership  members like Blair have become the driving force. He is now a shop steward at the MGM Grand and says he has been arrested five times at Culinary protests over the years. Nearly every worker on his list of 20 is a dues-paying member: everyone but that one guy on swing shift, said Blair.

The Culinary lost a few thousand members in the aftermath of the housing crash and Great Recession, which hit Vegas particularly hard, but the casinos have rebounded. And thanks to language in the union contract, workers whod been laid off when the Sahara Hotel and Casino closed in 2011 were entitled to return to work when the property reopened under new ownership as the SLS in 2014. The union views such successorship language as critical for its contracts, since casinos can easily change hands from one corporate owner to another."
2018-10-25,The Huffington Post,Congressman Says Trump May Have To Impose Martial Law On Border To Stop Migrant Caravan,"Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) suggested that President Donald Trump might have to declare martial law along the southern border of the United States to prevent a large group of Central American refugees and migrants from entering the country.

If, in fact, this mob heads towards California, whats gonna happen then? Starnes asked Gohmert. Because [Democratic governor] Jerry Brown will welcome them. You know its a sanctuary state. Do you think the president will allow that to happen?

I dont think the president will allow that to happen, Gohmert replied, suggesting that Trump could send troops to the borders over Browns objections and that the California governor would be committing treason by aiding the migrants.

This has got to be so massive, I mean, you might have to declare martial law along the border, Gohmert said. And the Democrats have been to stupid to realize that encouraging this caravan they may actually empower the president to do things they never wanted.

When Starnes asked Gohmert what martial law would look like, the congressman responded that it would mean federal troops coming in and being at the border, and if anyone tried to stop them, they could be dealt with.

You would probably need federal law enforcement to be there to arrest any Americans who might try to stop it, he elaborated. The military needs to have their weapons pointed towards Mexico and not toward the American people, but it may be that we have to have enough federal law enforcement, and maybe we have to have the National Guard if Jerry Brown is going to force the issue  but I hope and pray he wont be so stupid as to try to stop the U.S. government from enforcing our border because then were talking treasonous-type acts.

This has got to be so massive, I mean, you might have to declare martial law along the border.

Gohmerts martial law suggestion is part of the GOPs hyperbolic response to the group of migrants. As the United States midterm elections approach on Nov. 6, Republican politicians and Trump have framed the caravan as a massive security threat and have accused Democrats of funding the migrants, though theyve offered no evidence for that assertion.

The migrants have also become a source of conspiracy theories and a target of xenophobic vitriol. Trump alleged without proof that unknown Middle Easterners were among them, while Vice President Mike Pence cited false statistics about terrorist arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The caravan, which left Honduras earlier this month, is growing as more people join the loosely associated group rather than risk traveling alone. The migrants are currently over 1,000 miles from the U.S. and could take months to reach the border. Their exact route is unclear.

Gohmerts off-the-wall remark about martial law is one of the GOPs most extreme responses to the caravan. Yet its not an unfamiliar topic for him: In 2015, Gohmert said he understood conspiracy theorists claims that President Barack Obama was secretly planning to declare martial law and send the military to occupy Southern states and put residents in detention camps. The so-called Jade Helm conspiracy theory, embraced by the alt-right, held that military exercises were a cover for a nefarious government plot.

In his interview with Starnes, Gohmert characterized the migrant group as full of violent gangbangers and said he had faith that Trump would prevent the group from entering the U.S."
2018-07-18,The Huffington Post,Watch Barack Obama Joyfully Dancing About 7000 Miles Away From Trump,"While President Donald Trump was repeatedly refusing to hold Russian leader Vladimir Putin accountable for interference in the 2016 U.S. election, former President Barack Obama was showing off some dance moves in his fathers home country of Kenya.

For the first time since leaving office, Obama visited the African country on Monday to support his half-sister, Auma Obama, who opened a sports and vocational resource center in Siaya County, Kenya. The last time Obama visited Kenya was as U.S. president in 2015.

During the ceremony honoring the opening of the center, Obama, his sister and his 96-year-old step-grandmother got up to dance  and the family can move!

2018-03-25,The Huffington Post,Sen Mark Warner Facebook Not Being Fully Forthcoming About Data Leak,"I dont think Facebook has been fully forthcoming, Warner said Sunday on NBCs Meet The Press. I called out Facebook back in December of 16. In the Spring of 17, I questioned micro-targeting and the use of this really sketchy firm Cambridge Analytica. Early on for most of 2017, they blew that off.

The social media giant recently confirmed that Cambridge Analytica, a British voter-profiling firm with ties to Donald Trumps presidential campaign, harvested private data from millions of Facebook users in 2016. Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally apologized for his companys role in the breach and said it was taking steps to protect user data going forward.

Warner, who is helping probe Russias alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election, said that it may be necessary to regulate large social media companies like Facebook going forward.

All of these social media companies have said they have no responsibility for any of the content, Warner said. I think we have to relook at that. I think in many ways theyre media companies.

While Democrats have been critical of Facebook and its role in the 2016 election, calling on executives like Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, they do not have the power to compel him to do so.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Monday invited Zuckerberg to testify at a hearing on April 10 to discuss Facebooks past and future policies regarding the protection and monitoring of consumer data. Grassley also announced he had invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss the future of data privacy in the social media industry.

Zuckerberg took out full-page ads in several American and British newspapers on Sunday to apologize for the breach of trust in the scandal.

This was a breach of trust, and Im sorry we didnt do more at the time. Were now taking steps to ensure this doesnt happen again, read the ads.

I think Mr. Zuckerberg needs to come and testify before Congress, not just put an advertisement in the newspaper, Warner said. He said he would if he was the guy, he is the right guy. He cant send a staff. When Im called upon on an issue, its my name on the door. I mean you wouldnt take a staff member here on your show representing me.

He needs to come testify before Congress and explain how theyre going to work with us to both protect privacy; there are 50 million Facebook accounts that were used by this sketchy firm, Cambridge Analytica, and how were going to make sure it doesnt happen again in terms of weaponization of these social media platforms, he added."
2018-08-01,The Huffington Post,The Paul Manafort Trial A Whos Who Of Key Names,"He is now on trial for bank fraud and tax evasion charges in Virginia while he awaits another in D.C. This trial is one of the most closely watched events to date to come out of special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into the Trump campaigns possible collusion with Russia.

At the current trial, Trumps former campaign chairman faces 18 counts related to bank and tax fraud, which prosecutors say arose from his lobbying and political work in Ukraine. Though the charges in this case center on Manaforts finances rather than his work for Trump, some have speculated that Mueller is trying to pressure Manafort into flipping and providing dirt on the president.

Manafort spent decades lobbying and working on Republican campaigns, including those of Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Manafort also went into political consulting abroad. He advised authoritarian governments, including those in the Philippines, Nigeria and the former Zaire. In 2005, he advised Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov on how to improve his public image and later worked to elect the pro-Russia politician Viktor Yanukovych as president.

Manafort joined Trumps campaign in an unpaid position in March 2016, ascending to campaign chairman in May of that year. He resigned that August after he was named in the black ledger, which detailed payments from Ukraines Party of Regions  Yanukovychs party.

According to the indictment, Gates assisted Manafort with tampering with documents and misrepresenting Manaforts and his own finances. However, Gates is set to testify against his former business partner as part of a deal with prosecutors in which he pled guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI.

While on the stand Tuesday, Devine said he earned $600,000 for working on Yanukovychs 2010 presidential campaign and that his firm was paid by Manaforts company via wire transfer. He said he did not know if the money came from a foreign bank account.

Viktor Yanukovych wont appear at trial, but his name will figure prominently during testimony. The former president of Ukraine won his seat with the help of Manafort, who revamped Yanukovychs image during a run for prime minister in 2006.

Before that race, Yanukovych had been arrested twice, and his Party of Regions was known for being tied to organized crime and Russia. Manafort allegedly taught Yanukovych how to deliver a speech, stay on message and dress like a politician. Yanukovych was elected prime minister in 2006, but lost another race for the position in 2007.

Akhmetov hired Manafort in 2005 to improve the public image of his company. Akhmetov was an early backer of the Russia-friendly Party of Regions and brought Manafort in to work on the partys campaigns, including Yanukovychs."
2018-05-21,The Huffington Post,Democrats Plan Big Anti-Corruption Theme For Midterms,"The anti-corruption push is the second part of Democrats A Better Deal platform. The first part, released last summer, focused on an economic agenda. The newest part is A Better Deal for Our Democracy, which puts forward proposals to increase access to the ballot box, fight special interests and combat big money through campaign finance reform.

The new initiative will center on both President Donald Trumps administration and the culture in Congress that gives access to lobbyists and corporations. Trumps Cabinet officials, including Environmental Protection Agency leader Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, have drawn a torrent of negative headlines over allegations of unethical behavior, travel practices and ties to special interests. The presidents hotel in downtown D.C., in particular, has been the subject of several lawsuits.

Congress has to rein in the excesses of the executive branch, Democrats argue, and the current crop of Republican leaders arent going to do it.

Democrats unveiled their agenda Monday during a press conference on Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were joined by other lawmakers who have been working on these issues, including Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

President Trump has become the swamp and Americans are paying the price. The American people deserve better, Pelosi said at the press conference, citing the Trump administrations failure to reduce the price of prescription drugs and its repeal of numerous Obama-era regulations concerning air and water.

Schumer similarly lamented that Trump had failed to take on the powerful pharmaceutical industry, which is something he promised to do while on the campaign trail.

The Senate minority leader also pointed to the presidents personal attorney, Michael Cohen, as an example of how influence peddling and special interests had consumed the Trump administration. Following the 2016 election, Cohen leveraged his relationship with Trump to receive millions of dollars from companies eager for insight into his administration.

Democrats said they would bring accountability and transparency back to Washington by providing aggressive oversight of the Trump administration and by toughening the nations campaign finance laws in order to stem the flow of anonymous political spending known as dark money.

This focus on corruption is a revival of the partys successful messaging from the 2006 elections, when Democrats took control of the House and Senate from Republicans. They hammered away at the GOPs culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.

In that election cycle, the GOP was besieged by scandals amongst House members. The most famous was the Mark Foley scandal, which involved Republican congressman from Florida sending sexually explicit text messages to teenage boys.

When that news broke in September 2006, Republicans knew they were doomed. But other scandals had been dripping out bit by bit in the prior months.

Choking your mistress. Touching little boys. Taking money from the Russians. Questionable business dealings, said a GOP strategist who worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006 and requested anonymity to speak candidly. You name it, we had it. On and on, never ended.

Pelosi has been testing out the anti-corruption message since at least April; for example, she went after Pruitt for being a part of the Trump Administrations culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.

But it remains to be seen how much of this push will actually trickle down to the districts. While Democratic candidates have been talking about the tax law and its benefits for big corporations and lobbyists, they so far have not been focusing on Trump and the problems in his administration. Its rare to hear candidates talk about Trump in swing districts, with much more of the focus there resting on policy issues such as health care and gun control."
2018-11-03,The Huffington Post,Barack Obama Deals With Hecklers In The Most Respectful Un-Trumpian Way,"President Donald Trump could learn a thing or two from former President Barack Obama about how to handle hecklers.

Trump has infamously encouraged supporters to knock the crap out of people who protest him at rallies. Obama showed how it should be done Friday, however, when he was heckled while stumping for Democratic candidates Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum in Miami, Florida, ahead of Tuesdays midterms.

Sir, sir, dont curse in front of kids, come on. Dont do that in front of them, come on, Obama calmly told one heckler.

Were OK, were OK, were OK, Obama continued, after the unidentified person was reportedly removed by security and the crowd stopped chanting the ex-POTUS name.

You know what? This is what I look forward to, is having a few hecklers to get me back in the mood. You know, its like, I enjoy that. You always gotta have a few in order to know that youre on the campaign trail, he said.

Obama used similar tactics to thwart a second heckler, who interrupted his comments on health care.

Hold on a second. Sir, sir. Heres the deal, if you support the other candidates, then you should go support the other candidates. Dont be here, said Obama, before telling the heckler to not come hollering here.

2018-03-04,The Huffington Post,West Virginia Teachers Strike Set To Continue After Lawmakers Lower Raises,"The West Virginia teachers strike appeared all but certain to carry into next week after state legislators passed a bill late Saturday that would give educators a smaller raise than the governor had told them they would get.

The state Senate approved a measure granting teachers, other school personnel and state employees a 4 percent raise to end a statewide walkout that has closed schools in every county for seven days.

But the deal announced by Gov. Jim Justice (R) earlier this week  and the one that the West Virginia House of Delegates had overwhelmingly approved in order to end the work stoppage  would have given teachers and other school employees a 5 percent raise and state employees a 3 percent raise.

Unions representing school employees werent happy with the Senates decision to split the difference on raises. If the numbers proposed by Gov. Justice were going to be changed, they said they wanted all state workers brought up to a 5 percent pay hike.

In a joint statement, the unions said, You do not equalize pay for different groups by simply taking away from one and passing it to another. The purpose of this is clear  to divide us and pit us against each other.

They called on protesters to fill the halls of the state capitol in Charleston again next week: All public schools will be closed again on Monday and remain closed until the Senate honors the agreement that was made.

Teachers and other school personnel began their walkout on Feb. 22, closing schools in all 55 of the states counties in an unprecedented show of solidarity. It was the first teachers strike of its kind to hit the state in nearly 30 years.

Workers are demanding that the state curb their rising health insurance costs and give them significant pay hikes after years of stagnant wages. Teachers havent seen an across-the-board raise since 2014, and increasing health premiums have caused some workers take-home pay to decrease. West Virginia ranks 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay, according to the National Education Association.

On Tuesday, it seemed the strike might be resolved when Justice announced his pay raise plan alongside union leaders. But many rank-and-file workers didnt trust that Justice had the necessary votes, and they decided to continue the strike until a resolution was guaranteed.

Their concerns were well justified. Republican state senators apparently were not onboard with the plan that the governor announced. After it was passed by the House, they amended the bill so that the teachers pay hike would be dropped to 4 percent, all but guaranteeing that the unions would reject it.

The late Saturday night at the capitol came with some added drama. At first, senators accidentally passed a bill with language giving teachers the 5 percent raise they did not intend to give them.

The lawmakers had to go through several procedural steps to recall the bill, amend it to a 4 percent raise and pass it again."

2018-08-11,The Huffington Post,Trump Says Jeff Sessions Is Scared Stiff At Rigged Justice Department,"Leon Neal via Getty Images We're really in the weeds with this one.

President Donald Trump issued a pair of tweets Saturday afternoon from his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, accusing Attorney General Jeff Sessions of being scared stiff and calling the Department of Justice rigged.

The posts constitute the presidents latest criticisms of Sessions, who recused himself last year from overseeing the DOJs investigation into Russian election interference. As the probe has marched on, the attorney general has sustained increasingly regular attacks from the president.

I have never seen anything so Rigged in my life, Trump wrote. Our A.G. is scared stiff and Missing in Action. It is all starting to be revealed - not pretty. IG Report soon? Witch Hunt!

Trump also blasted Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer who compiled a dossier suggesting that Russian officials may possess damaging information on the president.

The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steeles many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC....  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2018

....Do you believe Nelly worked for Fusion and her husband STILL WORKS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I have never seen anything so Rigged in my life. Our A.G. is scared stiff and Missing in Action. It is all starting to be revealed - not pretty. IG Report soon? Witch Hunt!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2018

Trumps allies have latched onto the idea of some impropriety by Justice Department officials. The president pointed to a connection between the department and the consulting firm behind the dossier, Fusion GPS, which was hired by Hillary Clintons campaign. According to multiple Fox News reports, Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official who focuses on organized crime and drug smuggling, met with Steele and Fusion GPS founder Glen Simpson before the 2016 election. Ohrs wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS.

Some Republicans see this all as evidence of anti-Trump bias in the Justice Department. The presidents lawyers Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani touched on the idea when they co-hosted Sean Hannitys three-hour-long radio program Friday afternoon.

Yet the DOJs Russia investigation was not prompted by the Steele dossier, despite the presidents claims. The investigation began after then-Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that he knew Russia had dirt on Clinton, according to a House Intelligence Committee report.

Sessions recused himself from the investigation after it became public that hed held two secret meetings with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, during the 2016 campaign.

Earlier this month, Trump called on Sessions to halt the investigation once and for all."
2018-05-26,The Huffington Post,Agent Orange May Be Responsible For More Veteran Deaths Than The Government Is Willing To Recognize,"But then Navy Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, who had personally ordered the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, delivered a report to the VA in 1990 arguing that the chemical was dangerous to everyone exposed to it  and that the government knew of the risks as far back as the 1960s. Zumwalts son, also named Elmo, died of lymphoma and Hodgkins disease in 1988. The admiral believed these illnesses were the result of his sons exposure to the defoliant during his time as a patrol boat lieutenant in Vietnam from June 1969 to August 1970.

In some cases, the resistance to adding more to the list has not been the VA but rather the Office of Management and Budget. The federal agency, known as OMB, controls the VAs purse strings and has in the past been hostile to the idea of adding costs to the budget for veterans services. In March, now-dismissed VA Secretary David Shulkin told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee that he had recommended adding a handful of conditions to the list in a request to OMB last fall, but the agency was still looking at data and reviewing financial estimates."
2018-09-14,The Huffington Post,What Tish James Win In New York Says About Progressive Power,"Standing alongside Dasani Coates, a young homeless girl whose hardships had recently been chronicled by The New York Times, James decried the citys decrepit homeless shelters in the shadow of gleaming multimillion-dollar condos. Bloomberg, who was in attendance, survived the encounter with public criticism; he headed off to a two-week vacation in Hawaii and New Zealand shortly thereafter.

James ignored the pearl clutching and over more than four years in office  she was re-elected in 2017  turned the public advocates office into a fearsome bulldog for New Yorks most vulnerable residents. An April 2017 profile of James on New York news outlet City & State credits her with giving the office some teeth.

As of August 2015, with less than two years on the job, she had filed more lawsuits than her three predecessors combined had managed over the course of 20 years, according to The New York Times. Most of the suits were against city agencies for failing in their duties to low-income residents: against the NYC Finance Department for raising the rent on a 93-year-old widow living in subsidized housing, for example, and the NYC Education Department for failing to open school leadership meetings to the public. She also fought the city to provide air-conditioning on school buses and better heating for low-income public housing tenants.

On Thursday, James won her biggest fight yet, defeating three primary-election opponents  U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, law professor Zephyr Teachout and Leecia Eve, formerly a lawyer in Gov. Andrew Cuomos administration  for the Democratic nomination for New York state attorney general. Assuming James wins in November  and like Cuomo, she is heavily favored  she will be the first black woman to hold a major statewide office in New York.

James won her first public office, a seat representing central Brooklyn on the New York City Council, in a 2003 special election, in which she ran exclusively as a Working Families Party candidate. With the party-cum-progressive pressure groups help, she defeated the Democratic Partys chosen candidate, the brother of a slain councilman whose murder opened up the seat.

Its really critically important that I not be known as the Sheriff on Wall Street, James told The New York Times in August. She later clarified that she meant she would not focus on the financial industry to the exclusion of other targets.

Cuomo also forced James not to seek the WFPs endorsement as a condition of his support for her. The WFP, which was already taking on the governor and eight renegade state Senate Democrats in the primaries, nonetheless decided to offer its ballot line to both James and Teachout.

The organization, which is a pillar of New Yorks activist left, ended up spending $250,000 in ads blasting Maloney, who had voted to water down the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. On Thursday night, Bill Lipton, the WFPs New York state director, characterized Maloneys loss as a major win for the organization and the left more broadly.

A bad night would have been not just Andrew Cuomo winning but Sean Patrick Maloney, who was leading in the polls early on, winning as well, Lipton told HuffPost. He maintained that James decision to distance herself from the WFP said more about Cuomo than it did about her.

For New Yorks next top law enforcement official, taking on President Donald Trump would not be merely a matter of pugilistic rhetoric. The state attorney general has broad power to investigate any company in New York. The presidents parent company, the Trump Organization, is located in midtown Manhattan.

At her victory party in Crown Heights, a diverse neighborhood in Brooklyn, James vowed to use the attorney generals office to stand up to Trump  and promised shed remain the same scrappy fighter progressives had come to know and love.

Even if James turns out to be a tougher foe for Trump than for the other real estate and Wall Street titans who call the shots in New York, her place as the establishment candidate on Cuomos slate reflects a major leftward shift in the American political landscape in the last several years. When James won the citys public advocate post in 2013, no one would have imagined that the states establishment Democrats would be so frightened by an emboldened left that they would embrace a woman who had become a thorn in their side simply in hopes of avoiding the stronger sting of a reformer like Teachout."
2018-11-12,The Huffington Post,Trump Asylum Ban Will Extend To Thousands Of Unaccompanied Immigrant Minors,"A controversial Trump administration policy suspending asylum for immigrants who cross the border illegally will also apply to kids and teenagers traveling to the United States without their parents, contradicting last weeks comment by a high-level Trump official that it does not apply to unaccompanied minors.

This suspension does not apply to any unaccompanied alien children as defined in the [Immigration and Nationality Act], a senior administration official told reporters Friday on a briefing call, which was jointly hosted by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice. (To participate in the briefing, reporters had to agree to quote the officials without using their names.)

The distinction is an important one given the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended by Border Patrol  all of them, for the immediate future, now set to be barred from asylum by President Donald Trump. Border Patrol apprehended nearly 5,000 unaccompanied kids and teens last month. The minors it catches crossing the border illegally from Saturday on will be barred from one of the protections previously available to them.

On Friday evening, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted a six-page procedural guidance to its field officers. On the final page, it states that unaccompanied minors who cross the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization would be barred from asylum eligibility.

DOJ spokesman Steven Stafford said Monday that the official was referring to the fact that the new policy does not affect other benefits and protections for unaccompanied minors, as stated in the proclamation itself.

The asylum policy leaves some of the unaccompanied minor protections enshrined in law untouched, such as requirements under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of DHS, will still transfer unaccompanied minors to the Department of Health and Human Services for custody, just as it did before. Unaccompanied minors are still eligible for protections such as Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, which allow them to remain in the U.S.

President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Friday that, coupled with an interim rule issued by his administration on Thursday, temporarily barred certain immigrants from asylum.

But once in immigration courts, which are part of the Department of Justice, those minors are ineligible for asylum, just like everyone else apprehended after crossing the border illegally under the new policy. The policy will be in effect until at least 90 days after its implementation on Saturday, barring changes.

Under the policy, asylum-seekers will be able to gain those protections only if they go to legal ports of entry to request help. In the past and under U.S. law, immigrants could request asylum even if they crossed the border illegally first.

The Trump administration argues its new restrictions fit within the presidents authority to suspend entry into the U.S. of certain groups of immigrants. The American Civil Liberties Union and other human rights groups filed suit and are aiming to block the change.

We really hoped that [the policy] would not include unaccompanied children because theyre particularly vulnerable, she said. We really fear for these unaccompanied children its going to affect."
2018-02-06,The Huffington Post,The Fed Took On Wells Fargo What About Everyone Else,"In the decade or so since the onset of the financial crisis, JPMorgan Chase has racked up 52 fines and settlements with various agencies of the federal government, totaling $28.8 billion.

Its an impressive array of infractions: bribing Chinese government officials; violating economic sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan; being complicit in the Bernie Madoff investment scandal; rigging interest rates; manipulating energy markets; alternately ripping off and bribing local governments; retaliating against a whistleblower; deceiving regulators about trading data; and creating a litany of mortgage abuses and related scams involving the sale of bad mortgages to investors. The complete list, compiled by the Good Jobs First nonprofit, includes employment discrimination, accounting violations and unpaid wages, among other abuses large and small.

JPMorgan, which declined to comment for this article, is hardly unique. For many years now, the United States government has treated corporate fraud and abuse as a line-item cost on a balance sheet, not a matter of public trust and accountability.

Which is why Janet Yellens final action as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve was so surprising. Late Friday, the Fed ordered Wells Fargo to replace four members of its board and barred the bank from further growth until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls. The decision is rightly being interpreted as a milestone in the central banks regulatory oversight of the financial system, a belated government censure for a scandal in which Wells Fargo created millions of bogus accounts for customers over the course of several years.

The Fed could, of course, go further. It has the power to ban individuals from the banking industry for life  a penalty routinely deployed against tellers who pocket $20 bills from the register. It didnt invoke that authority or name any specific directors in its order. And if the central bank wants to be consistent about its oversight of big bank abuse, there is no reason to exempt other serial offenders from the crackdown. Wells Fargos account scandal is unique, but JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America each have a long, long list of federal fines and settlements to their names in the years since the crash.

But Yellens parting shot against Wells Fargo is a significant departure for an institution that simply has not taken serious action against the leaders of rogue banks in the past. As a regulatory agency, the Fed has been just as likely to help big banks wriggle out of rules policing excessive risk as it has been to write them. Yellen was planting a flag. If you cant police your bank, you shouldnt be on its board.

Over the past year, the parade of outrages has obscured deeper uncomfortable truths about the pervasiveness of corruption  legal or otherwise  in American government. President Donald Trump and his family appear to be openly profiting from his presidency. But this is a cartoon version of recent political history, not a radical break with it.

Throughout the financial crisis and its aftermath, former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner repeatedly railed against what he called Old Testament justice as a response to the breakdown on Wall Street (he used variants of the phrase no less than 18 times in his memoir). People who wanted to see bankers held personally accountable for their role in the 2008 collapse  a calamity fueled by stupidity, carelessness and criminal behavior  were no more than bloodthirsty rubes, he argued. Clawing back bonuses, firing directors or jailing executives for fraud was no different than putting heads on pikes in response to a bad harvest. It wouldnt fix a broken system or help people get back to work. Geithners perspective was shared by Attorney General Eric Holder, who told Congress that prosecuting top bankers for crimes  however blatant  would harm the financial system.

Geithner managed to revive bank liquidity and get a lot of regulations written. But he didnt actually fix anything. By allowing big banks to function as ongoing engines of fraud amid high unemployment, stagnant wages and the annihilation of middle-class housing wealth (which had profound implications for black families), he and the Obama administration fed twin political and economic problems.

Big banks have continued to behave badly. Yellen wouldnt have had to punish Wells Fargo if it hadnt been creating so many fake accounts post-crisis. More important, the anger at Geithners governing philosophy fueled enthusiasm for outsider political candidates, many who held hateful ideologies and authoritarian impulses. When democracy doesnt seem to work, people embrace alternatives.

Trump has made a mockery out of corporate accountability during his time in office. He named a foreclosure fraud kingpin as his treasury secretary and picked Goldman Sachs bailout attorney to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. He killed a rule requiring retirement account managers to act in the best interests of their clients, and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, freshly installed at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has scuttled an investigation into the massive consumer data breach at Equifax.

But while corruption may be bipartisan, it is neither popular nor  as Yellens kiss-off to Wells Fargo shows  inevitable. Prosperity and accountability go hand in hand. Building trust in democratic institutions isnt all that complicated. It just takes political will."

Ginsburg, 85, was admitted to George Washington University Hospital on Thursday morning, according to a Supreme Court press release. She initially went home after her fall, but experienced complications overnight.

Tests showed that she fractured three ribs on her left side and she was admitted for observation and treatment, the statement read.

Ginsburg, a cancer survivor, is the oldest member of the court and has had several medical emergencies in the past decade. In 2012, she fractured two ribs in a fall, though she kept the incident private for several months, according to CNBC. In 2014, she underwent a procedure to have a stent placed in her right coronary artery.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court was scheduled to host a ceremony for new Justice Brett Kavanaugh. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were supposed to be in attendance. It remains unclear how Ginsburgs absence might affect the ceremony.

2018-07-06,The Huffington Post,Mom Who Confronted EPAs Scott Pruitt Turning Up The Heat Works,"Kristin Mink, the Washington, D.C., mom who confronted then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt while he was eating lunch this week, had a simple message for others frustrated with government officials: Speak out.

Turning up the heat works, Mink said in a phone interview on Thursday. I think that I was one little tiny piece of so many people working to get Scott Pruitt out of office. Theres been so much investigative journalism, action from so many activists and then me, a pissed-off mom.

Pruitt resigned Thursday following months of ethical scandals that prompted more than a dozen federal investigations into his leadership at EPA. The former Oklahoma attorney general faced a near-constant onslaught of criticism over his frequent use of first-class travel, the installation of a $43,000 phone booth in his office and a sweetheart rental deal for a condo owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist, among other issues.

1) Our voices matter! Speak up every chance you get! Civil servants work for US, our taxes pay their salaries; tell them what kind of job theyre doing! 

2) Unless we want another EPA admin dirtying the air & water for the next gen, VOTE THIS NOVEMBER! Midterms matter! #VOTE2018  Kristin Mink (@KristinMinkDC) July 5, 2018

Mink, a schoolteacher and mother of a 2-year-old son, set social media ablaze earlier this week after she posted a video of her calmly asking Pruitt to resign while he was eating lunch at a Washington restaurant.

This is my son. He loves animals. He loves clean air. He loves clean water, Mink says in the clip to a stony-faced Pruitt. Meanwhile, youre slashing strong fuel standards for cars and trucks for the benefit of big corporations. We deserve to have somebody at the EPA who actually does protect our environment, somebody who believes in climate change and takes it seriously for the benefit of all of us, including our children. I would urge you to resign before your scandals push you out.

While Minks suggestion wound up becoming reality, she said she doesnt believe EPA is being handed over to someone that will switch gears anytime soon. Rather, some worry Wheeler, a Capitol Hill insider, will be far more effective than Pruitt at carrying out President Donald Trumps anti-environment agenda.

We cant be too excited about this for too long because hes being replaced by a coal lobbyist, Mink said. Were not going to get somebody thats heading the EPA thats going to protect our clean air ... were not going to get that with the president and Congress as it is now.

She urged others in her position, the pissed-off moms, to continue to speak out against White House policies, saying, regardless of nerves, its always worth it.

Remember, these are your employees, and you have a right to voice your opinions to them, she noted. If you see someone out there and theyre doing a great job, tell them. If you see someone who you dont agree with, speak to them, too. And take a video."
2018-10-31,The Huffington Post,There Arent Enough People In Central America For A National Emergency On The Border,"President Donald Trump has ordered 5,200 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to repel what he calls an invasion. But the ongoing rush of Central American migration is significantly smaller than earlier surges. And like the previous wave of migration from Mexico, its probably not going to last. There simply arent enough people in Central America.

Theres just not much demographic potential for mass migration from Central America, said Douglas Massey, who has spent the last three decades tracking migration as a co-founder of the Mexico Migration Project. It is heading in the same direction as Mexico  toward an aging population with limited growth, only the base population is much smaller.

By the numbers, there is nothing resembling a national emergency on the border, as Trump has called it. Border Patrol arrested fewer than 400,000 migrants last year. For comparison, that figure for the year 2000 was 1.6 million  back when Border Patrol had about half the number of agents it now employs. Arrest rates for the last eight years have hovered at similarly low levels not seen since the early 1970s.

The reason arrests are so low is that mass Mexican migration to the U.S. ended a decade ago and shows no sign of resuming. Despite Trumps fury, he took office under conditions more favorable to immigration hard-liners than any president since Richard Nixon.

Neither Border Patrol nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement can take as much credit for that as they might like. The U.S. financial crisis that began at the end of 2007 triggered the drop in unauthorized Mexican migration by reducing labor demand. But perhaps more importantly, the crisis hit as the Mexican baby-boom era was petering out. In 1970, the fertility rate in Mexico stood at nearly seven children per woman. Today, its around 2.2, according to the World Bank.

The birthrate matters, because most people who migrate to the United States without authorization do so before they turn 30. As Mexicos population has aged, the number of migrants attempting to cross into the United States illegally has fallen.

The defining change for unauthorized crossings over the past few years is that the number of Central American families and unaccompanied children jumped by tens of thousands in 2014 and has remained high. This year marked a record for Border Patrol arrests of Central American families, the vast majority of which come from the so-called Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

But Central America is headed down the same demographic path as Mexico. Together, the populations of those three countries total fewer than 31 million. Thats about a third of Mexicos population in the year 2000, when border arrests peaked.

And those three countries have similarly low birthrates. Guatemalas is the highest, at nearly three births per woman, according to the World Bank. For Honduras, that figure is 2.45 per woman, and for El Salvador its just under 2.1  a figure barely touching the level that would replace the countrys population.

Immigration from El Salvador may have already peaked...

That phenomenon might already be underway in El Salvador. Border Patrol arrested more than 27,000 Salvadoran families in 2016, along with 17,500 unaccompanied children. This year, the number of families dropped by half, and the number of kids fell by nearly three-quarters.

That trend might be partly explained by a decline in violence. El Salvador has one of the worlds highest homicide rates, which is one of the factors that prompted people to migrate to the United States in higher than normal numbers from 2014 to 2016. Over the last year, though, the homicide rate dropped.

But the underlying reality is that El Salvador is a tiny country with a fertility rate below replacement level, and it has already lost some 1.4 million migrants to the U.S. since 1970  about a fifth of its total population.

...and Guatemala and Honduras could be next

The two other Northern Triangle countries have more capacity to sustain higher levels of migration for longer periods of time. Honduras has suffered ongoing political instability since a 2009 coup, along with high levels of violence and poverty. Guatemala has a larger population, a higher fertility rate and large numbers of indigenous farmers struggling with crop failures  a trend some experts believe is linked to climate change.

But those countries still face the same constraints as El Salvador. Theyre small. Their populations are aging. The number of migrants they send may rise or fall from one year to the next, but over the long term it will likely peak and decline. And it will probably happen for demographic reasons that U.S. policymakers dont control."

2018-09-27,The Huffington Post,High Drama Precedes Brett Kavanaugh-Christine Blasey Ford Senate Hearing,"Republicans have derided her allegation as part of a smear campaign and a Democratic plot to sink Kavanaughs nomination. But after more allegations have emerged, some GOP senators have allowed that much is riding on Kavanaughs performance. Even President Donald Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh and fiercely defends him, said he was open to changing my mind.

The hearing will be the first time the country sees and hears from the 51-year-old Ford beyond the grainy photo that has been flashed on television in the 10 days since she came forward with her contention. In testimony released in advance of the hearing, she said she was appearing only because she felt it was her duty, was frankly terrified and has been the target of vile harassment and even death threats.

The stakes for both political parties  and the country  are high. Republicans are pushing to seat Kavanaugh before the November midterms, when Senate control could fall to the Democrats and a replacement Trump nominee could have even greater difficulty. Kavanaughs ascendance to the high court could help lock in a conservative majority for a generation, shaping dozens of rulings on abortion, regulation, the environment and more.

In the hours before the hearing, Republicans were rocked by the new accusation from a third woman, Julie Swetnick. In a sworn statement, she said she witnessed Kavanaugh consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early 1980s. Her attorney, Michael Avenatti, who also represents a porn actress who is suing Trump, provided her sworn declaration to the Judiciary Committee.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell all week has said Republicans will turn to a committee vote on Kavanaugh after the hearing. They hope for a roll call by the full Senate  where they have a scant 51-49 majority  early next week with the aim of getting him on the court as its new term begins.

Ford plans to tell the committee that, one night in the summer of 1982, a drunken Kavanaugh forced her down on a bed, groped me and tried to take off my clothes, then clamped his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream before she was able to escape.

Transcripts of private interviews with committee investigators show they asked Kavanaugh about two previously undisclosed accusations received by Senate offices. One came in an anonymous letter sent to the office of Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., describing an incident in a bar in 1998, when Kavanaugh was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton. The other accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in college. Kavanaugh denied them both."
2018-08-08,The Huffington Post,Theres A Lot Of Drama Right Now With The West Virginia Supreme Court,"Thorney Lieberman via Getty Images All four sitting justices of West Virginias Supreme Court of Appeals are facing possible impeachment over allegations that they misused public money.

When did this all begin?

What happens next?

The West Virginia House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against the four sitting justices this week. The full House will consider them next week, and if the majority votes to adopt them, the articles will advance to the Senate for review, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail.

If at least two-thirds of the Senates elected members vote to adopt the articles, an impeachment trial will be set up to determine whether the justices are guilty of the presented offenses. Any justice found guilty would be removed from the bench and banned from seeking public office in the state.

Who might replace them?

Under state law, if a justice with more than two years left in their term resigns or is removed from office at least 84 days before the next general election, the governor will appoint an interim judge until a new judge can be elected. But its unlikely the four remaining justices will leave by Aug. 14, which is 84 days prior to the states general election in November.

The more likely scenario is that the judges wont resign by Aug. 14, so whoever the governor appoints to replace them will remain in power until at least May 2020, when the next special election can take place, according to the Gazette-Mail.

Why is their replacement raising concerns?

West Virginia Delegate Mike Pushkin, a Democrat, attempted to block Justice from handpicking Loughrys replacement by introducing an impeachment inquiry in February so that there would be ample time for his removal before the August deadline. Pushkin and other Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee have suggested that Republicans have purposely dragged out impeachment efforts to avoid the timely election of the judges successors.

Here we are 6 months after I filed my resolution, more than a month after we convened this impeachment proceeding, and nothing has happened, Pushkin said in a statement. Our concern always was that the House Republican Leadership would drag their feet, and try to pack the court with appointed Justices, rather than having a Court composed of Justices voted on by our citizens. It turns out our fears were justified.

Who are the justices?

The allegations include using a government vehicle for personal use and submitting mileage claims for reimbursement, as well as taking home a historical piece of furniture from the courthouse for personal use. Like the other four justices, he is also accused of spending thousands of dollars on renovations to his chambers.

Loughrys 22-count indictment is made up of 16 counts of mail fraud, which carry a penalty of up to 20 years each; two counts of wire fraud, which carry a penalty of up to 20 years each; three counts of making false statements to a federal agent, which carry a penalty of up to 5 years each; and one count of witness tampering, which carries a penalty of up to 20 years.

Workman, who was elected in November 2008 and replaced Loughry as chief justice in 2017, is the subject of four articles of impeachment. The articles highlight $111,035 in renovations to her chambers, according to WCHS-TV. Her purchases reportedly included an $8,892 sofa that was paid for with state money.

He has agreed to plead guilty to the charge later this month as part of an agreement with federal prosecutors, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported Wednesday. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine."
2018-09-14,The Huffington Post,Donald Trump Wouldnt Want To Know What Jimmy Carter Would Do With His Policies,"Former President Jimmy Carter clearly has no love or respect for the policies of President Donald Trumps administration.

Following a recent series of hospitalizations, and after consulting her family and doctors, Mrs. Bush, now age 92, has decided not to seek additional medical treatment and will instead focus on comfort care, Jim McGrath, a spokesman for the office of former President George H. W. Bush, said in the statement.

It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face of failing health, worrying not for herself  thanks to her abiding faith  but for others, McGrath said. She is surrounded by a family she adores, and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving.

She was hospitalized in Houston on Jan. 18, 2017, for bronchitis. Her husband was hospitalized the same day for shortness of breath, prompting his doctor to excuse him from President Donald Trumps inauguration two days later.

2018-04-30,The Huffington Post,Roy Moore Files Complaint Claiming He Was Targeted By Political Conspiracy,"Former Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore filed a complaint on Monday claiming he was the target of a political conspiracy ahead of the Alabama special election in December.

Moore, a former judge, lost to Democrat Doug Jones in a special election to fill a Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Jones defeated Moore by about 20,000 votes  or 1.5 percentage points.

Controversy swirled around Moore in the final months of the campaign as several women came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct, including allegations that he pursued and harassed teenage girls when he was in his 30s and sexually assaulted one. Moore has denied the allegations.

In his complaint, filed in civil court in Etowah County, Alabama, Moore claims that his accusers shared a common design and planned their allegations to undermine his campaign. The complaint names four of Moores accusers  Leigh Corfman, Debbie Wesson Gibson, Beverly Young Nelson and Tina Johnson  as well as Richard Hagedorn, a reported friend of Corfmans.

In a statement released on a campaign Facebook page, Moores attorney, Melissa Isaak, said the allegations against Moore arose from a political conspiracy to destroy his personal reputation and defeat him in the special Senate election for United States Senate.

Moore has filed this action not only to hold accountable those who are guilty of slanderous and libelous conduct, but also to restore his good name, character, and reputation with the people of Alabama, Isaak said.

Mondays complaint claims the womens allegations arose coincidentally roughly a month before the election and that Moore faced no hint of scandal in his years in public office prior to that.

Moore was twice elected chief justice of Alabama and twice removed from court for violations. In 2003, a judicial ethics panel removed Moore from office for failing to comply with an order to take a Ten Commandments monument out of the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery. He was re-elected, but was removed from the court again in September 2016 for defying federal orders on same-sex marriage. The former judge has said he believes homosexual conduct should be illegal.

The complaint also reiterates the claim that Corfman, whose allegations were first published in The Washington Post, was paid for coming forward with her story  an accusation she denies.

Corfman filed a lawsuit against Moore in January, saying he made defamatory remarks against her after she alleged that he touched her sexually in 1979, when she was 14 and he was 32. Moore, in turn, sued Corfman for defamation in April.

Neil Roman, an attorney for Corfman, said in a statement to the Alabama Media Group that Moores latest claims have no more merit than those he has made before."
2018-08-13,The Huffington Post,Wisconsin GOP Hits Governor Candidate As Hypocrite For Foxconn Stance,"Scott Olson via Getty Images Former State Rep. Kelda Roys pushed an economic development project in her district while she was in the legislature.

The Wisconsin Republican Party is attacking one of the leading Democrats challenging incumbent Gov. Scott Walker, arguing her opposition to a major development deal with the Taiwanese technology manufacturer Foxconn is hypocritical because she backed a separate financing deal in the state six years ago.

The GOP is zeroing in on legislation for a tax-increment financing deal that then-state Rep. Kelda Roys pushed in 2012. It would have helped the world headquarters of Spectrum Brands, which makes a variety of consumer products such as insect repellant and the George Foreman grill, move from Madison to the nearby suburb of Middleton.

Madison Mayor Paul Soglin  now another candidate in the governors race  criticized the legislation at the time, as did now-U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who defeated Roys in a primary in 2012 to win his congressional seat.

The $3 billion Foxconn deal, which would create an estimated 13,000 jobs at a manufacturing plant in Racine County, has become a major issue in this years governors race. The deal is unpopular in public opinion polling, especially in rural parts of the state, but is supported by both Walker and President Donald Trump.

Roys and other Democrats have criticized the deal as corporate welfare and a massive giveaway to a foreign company, and have questioned why state money is going to Foxconn instead of to local roads or schools. Roys, in particular, has emphasized the homeowners who would be displaced to build the massive factory, which is expected to have as much floor space as 130 Walmarts.

The Wisconsin GOP has specifically attacked Roys  who is considered the Democrat most likely to upset the front-runner, state Superintendent of Schools Tony Evers, in Tuesdays primary  for not supporting the deal with Foxconn.

Its the height of hypocrisy for Kelda Roys to stand against Foxconns 13,000 good paying, family-supporting jobs for political reasons when she led the charge on similar legislation while serving in the legislature, Wisconsin GOP spokesman Alec Zimmerman said in a statement to HuffPost. This is just further proof that shell say anything to get noticed in the crowded Democrat primary.

Roys dismissed the comparison between the two projects and noted that tax-increment financing deals like the one she pushed for Middleton werent generally controversial.

Its like saying a small-town bowling alley and Six Flags Great America are the same thing, she said in a phone interview. This is a far cry from the largest corporate giveaway in the history of our state.

Public polling has given Evers a large lead but Roys, 39, has made the case that shes the candidate most likely to fire up the younger, progressive voters needed to defeat Walker. She has the backing of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y) and EMILYs List, and she has rolled out the endorsement of scores of local officials in recent weeks.

The legislation for a tax-increment financing deal for Spectrum Brands cruised through the state Senate, then fell apart amid opposition from Soglin and Pocan when it came up for a vote in the Wisconsin Assembly.

This is allowing one neighboring community to raid an employer from another neighboring community, Pocan said on the floor of assembly at the time. Some would call this a corporate giveaway."
2018-02-20,The Huffington Post,Why Cloud Seeding Is Increasingly Attractive To The Thirsty West,"Colorados $1 million a year program has been around since the 1970s and is paid for not just by the state, ski resorts, and local water users but also water districts as far away as Los Angeles that want to increase snowmelt into the Colorado River, which sustains over 30 million people across the Southwest. Currently, most of the river basin is experiencing a drought.

Cloud seeding machines are nothing like the snow guns used to blast water over ski slopes. Instead, when theyre turned on they generate smoke that floats into the air like incense. Some state programs rely on ground-based machines. Others use airplanes to drop flares that generate silver iodide smoke into clouds, or to fly into a storm with flares strapped to their wings.

Idaho Power, which serves customers in Idaho and Oregon, has been using cloud seeding to boost the volume of water moving through its hydroelectric dams since 2003. The companys representatives say the $3 million seeding program they oversee  which is partly funded by the state and other water users  generates billions of gallons of additional water for much less than 1 percent of the companys operational budget.

As the technology advances, cloud seeding could get even better results. In Colorado, Busto is adding more remote-controlled generators that can be driven high on a mountain, closer to clouds, and left there all winter. Currently, most cloud seeding machines in the state are installed on private property and manually operated by homeowners and farmers who are paid to turn them on when a storm comes.

Still, Busto warns that cloud seeding isnt a cure for drought. Take this winter, which has been too warm and too dry for seeding. We have not been able to run our cloud seeding machines because theres been no storms coming through, he said; the machines have only run a handful of times so far."
2018-05-23,The Huffington Post,Gun Reform Advocate Lucy McBath Heads To Runoff For Georgia House Seat,"With 99 percent of precincts reporting, McBath amassed an unofficial tally of about 14,700 votes (about 36 percent of the total number) in Tuesdays primary race, according to The New York Times. Abel had 12,400 votes (30.5 percent).

McBath, a national spokeswoman for gun control group Moms Demand Action, was spurred into activism by the death of her son, Jordan Davis, a black 17-year-old who was shot dead in 2012 at a gas station in Florida by a white man complaining about loud music. In her first run for public office, McBath was initially planning to run for a state house seat, but she pivoted to a run for Congress after the February school shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people  most of them teens.

I knew that I could no longer sit on the sidelines, McBath wrote on her campaign site, while the politicians in the pocket of the gun manufacturing lobby decide the future of our gun laws.

If elected to Congress, McBath intends to push for common sense gun violence prevention laws, including background checks, raising the age for firearm purchases to 21 years old and fighting against conceal carry measures.

This [campaign] has been my therapy, McBath told Refinery29 in late February, of her run for Congress. This has been the best therapy in the world for me because it makes me feel like Jordan didnt die in vain, because we can change the culture that he died under.

The two-time breast cancer survivor is also committed to fighting for issues beyond gun control, like affordable health care and womens access to health services.

Abel is a co-founder of an IT consulting company and has served on the board of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. A native of South Africa who moved to the U.S. as a teenager, he is also running on a platform of sensible gun control and affordable health care.

2018-11-24,The Huffington Post,In California A County Of Children Without Schools,"Finney, a teacher at Childrens Community Charter School in Paradise, California, is one of the lucky ones. Most of her school burned down, but her house is still standing, which is more than many of her students and co-workers can say.

In the morning, students sit around her kitchen table, practicing math problems on a whiteboard that Finney borrowed from a neighbor. In the afternoon, they go outside for recess on her front lawn, wearing plastic masks to protect against the polluted air as they play basketball.

For teachers in Butte County, Nov. 8 could have been any other day filled with backpacks and blackboards, until the sky became dark and students were ordered to evacuate. Now, after the smoke has cleared, many will never be able to return to their classrooms, after the fire destroyed at least three schools and damaged five more in the Paradise area. County schools have been closed since the fire, with the hope to start up again Dec. 3. But its unclear where classrooms will be housed and how many students will be coming back to the area. Students and teachers will work together on reading, writing and arithmetic, but also on finding on shelter and rebuilding their lives.

For the past few days, about a dozen students have come to Finneys house, as her husband, a firefighter, has gone out to sift through rubble for missing persons. Only about two of her students still have their homes. Those that are still in the area come to her from temporary trailers and the homes of friends and family members. The structure and sense of normalcy  at least for a few hours a day  has been helping them cope with all the ways in which their typical routine has come crashing down.

Most students from Paradise Unified School District who have been reached by teachers say they hope to stay in the district, according to Marc Kessler, a seventh-grade teacher at Paradise Intermediate School. Kessler has been working with other teachers to try and track down every student in the days since the fires. Students also communicate with teachers and each other through a website that was set up for them to share their experiences.

Kessler spends about three hours a day making calls, in addition to delivering gift cards to families in need and trying to track down supplies for the makeshift school that students will eventually return to. Teachers at his school are working to create a school for thousands of students in two weeks. They need computers, chairs and desks.

Aldersons school burned down, along with her house. Before the fire reached the school, she spent the morning trying to occupy her students in her classroom, keep them calm with games and tasks that would mask the chaos of the day.

But eventually, the fire made its way to the back door of her home, and she was sent to collect whatever she could salvage. For her students, the situation only got worse. When a bus came to evacuate students who hadnt been retrieved my parents, it left without taking all the schools kids. Teachers were told to stuff children in their cars and drive for their lives, embers flying all around them.

Shafer has been helping at a shelter for those who have been displaced as he works to track down his students, who are spread out between shelters, tents, trailers and houses of family members and friends in other communities. Many of Shafers students  who he treated in schools around the county  already technically fit the definition of homeless before the fires started. He can only imagine how tenuous their already fragile routines must feel."

Andrew Cuomo for re-election on Wednesday, hours before the incumbent is set to debate Democratic rival Cynthia Nixon ahead of their faceoff in the states Sept. 13 gubernatorial primary.

Andrew Cuomo has the skills, guts and experience to defend NY against the conservative agenda coming out of Washington

 

Proud to be endorsed by my friend @JoeBiden pic.twitter.com/GoY8ocKId4  Andrew Cuomo (@andrewcuomo) August 29, 2018

In a 30-second spot first posted on Twitter, Biden lauded Cuomo as the antidote to Washington politicians seeking to roll back decades of progress.

Nixon, whose background includes portraying Miranda Hobbes on the HBO series Sex and the City, has consistently positioned herself to the left of Cuomo.

Wednesdays debate represents a critical opportunity for the challenger; recent polls show her trailing Cuomo by about 30 percentage points. Cuomo has also thumped Nixon in fundraising, with $25 million in his war chest vs. Nixons roughly $500,000.

Its Cynthia Nixons do or die moment. She has to score points somehow, Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who previously advised Cuomo, told Reuters. Shes got to get a really significant knockout in order to get herself into the campaign because shes not really in it."
2018-11-13,The Huffington Post,Disney Permanently Bans Trump Fan For Repeatedly Flashing Trump 2020 Signs,"It worked  sorta  except now hes been permanently banned from all Disney properties.

Earlier this month, Dion Cini rode down Splash Mountain at Walt Disney World holding a Trump 2020 sign above his head. Then he held up a Keep America Great sign on Expedition Everest, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

But Cini wasnt a first time offender. About seven weeks ago, the New Yorker was banned from the park after he unfurled a giant Trump banner at the Main Street train station.

Disneys park rules state that the usage of any flag, banner or sign to incite a crowd is prohibited, but park officials decided to give him a second chance, provided he no longer display any more banners or flags.

And I wanted to actually abide by their rules, and not hold up a flag to incite a crowd, but I kind of wanted to test them, he told local station WFTV. I just really wanted to find out whether or not it had to do with unfurling a flag, or what was written on the flag.

He also claims that park officials werent clear about what he could and couldnt do.

They never mentioned the fact that there was some kind of safety issue on the ride. That I was holding up a sign and I shouldnt be doing that, he told the station.

Cini says that he wont break the law though, which means he wont be going back to Walt Disney World, even though hes held an annual pass for nearly two decades.

However, Cini does plan to continue to fly Trump 2020 banners around the country and promises the banners will get even bigger, according to WOFL TV."
2018-08-14,The Huffington Post,Ben Carson Wants To Roll Back An Obama-Era Fair Housing Rule,"Kevin Lamarque/Reuters U.S. Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson lambasted the current fair housing rule as ""suffocating.""

Carson announced Monday that HUD had formally begun the process of revamping the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, a July 2015 regulation that had required communities and local governments receiving federal funding to identify and address any barriers to fair housing like racial segregation.

The rule had been seen as a belated effort by HUD to strengthen the landmark 1968 Fair Housing Act, which prohibits race discrimination in the sale and rental of housing, according to The Washington Post.

But Carson, who has denounced government efforts to desegregate housing in America as failed socialist experiments, said in a statement that while his department believes very deeply in the purposes of the Fair Housing Act, he criticized the current rule for dictating often ... unworkable requirements and actually imped[ing] the development and rehabilitation of affordable housing.

Its ironic that the current AFFH rule, which was designed to expand affordable housing choices, is actually suffocating investment in some of our most distressed neighborhoods that need our investment the most, Carson said.

Today we begin the formal process of examining how we can get the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulation right by 1st listening & learning from those who must put these rules to work & live with its impact. https://t.co/2Z4WoreZcQ pic.twitter.com/ec0OeaNfve  Ben Carson (@SecretaryCarson) August 13, 2018

Sara Pratt, a civil rights attorney and former Obama official who oversaw HUDs enforcement of the rule, lambasted the Trump administrations move this week.

Youre going back to communities willfully blinding themselves to patterns of segregation, Pratt told NBC News. Without this rule, communities will not do the work to eliminate discrimination and segregation.

Pratts law firm is representing a coalition of civil rights groups that is suing HUD for its earlier efforts to delay and dilute the fair housing rule. HUD announced in January that it was suspending the obligation of most local governments to comply with the rule until 2020 or, in many cases, 2025.

Carson said his department intends to craft a new, fairer rule that creates choices for quality housing across all communities.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, he explained how the Trump administration plans to pivot away from efforts to integrate lower-income housing into wealthier neighborhoods, which the Obama administration had encouraged, and instead push for an increase in housing supply overall.

I want to encourage the development of mixed-income multifamily dwellings all over the place, Carson told the paper.

HUD said it is accepting public comment for the next 60 days as it mulls the rule change."
2018-03-19,The Huffington Post,Sex Trafficking Bills Backed By Feminist Democrats Could Cause More Harm Than Good,"Twenty-four Senate Democrats, including potential presidential candidates Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), have thrown their weight behind a soon-to-pass bill that is supposed to protect sex workers but would actually put them at greater risk by making it harder for them to use the websites they rely on to protect their identities and screen clients, according to sex workers and their advocates.

The Senate could vote as early as this week on the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act (SESTA). A version of the legislation easily passed the House, 388-25, late last month. Both proposals would hold online platforms, such as Craigslist and the personal classifieds site Backpage, liable for user content related to sex trafficking. This could encourage websites to censor sex-related ads to protect themselves from litigation, free-speech advocates warn. Sex workers would have to turn to methods that offer less privacy to promote their services, making it tougher to screen clients or warn others about dangerous customers.

Voluntary sex work is often conflated with sex trafficking, which is less common than trafficking of people into farm, factory or household labor. But many sex workers are not victims of the sex trade or human trafficking; they are self-supporting and have decided for themselves to do the work. Given harsh prostitution laws across the country, sex workers often work underground and depend on sites like Backpage, which allow users to screen clients, protect their identities and find clients.

Once websites are legally liable for user-related content related to sex trafficking, theyll turn to automated filters to find and delete that content, predicted Elliot Harmon, an activist at Election Freedom Frontier. But automated filters, while useful to site moderators, arent an effective method of monitoring content, leading to needless censorship. Googles PerspectiveAPI, an automated filter meant to monitor toxicity in online discussions, was unable to differentiate between I am a Jew and I dont like Jews. Theres no reason to believe automated filters will be any better at differentiating between ads for voluntary sex work and those tied to sex trafficking than they were at identifying anti-Semitism, Harmon added. And sites that cant post sex workers ads without fear of being sued probably wont post them at all.

And pushing sex work-related ads offline will leave sex-trafficking victims even worse off than they are now, said Jean Bruggeman, executive director of Freedom Network USA, an advocacy group that supports victims of human trafficking. Ads for sex work that appear online are easier to monitor and track than ones that appear elsewhere, Bruggeman noted. Without an online platform, sex traffickers and their victims will be more difficult to track down; having a digital footprint is actually helpful when it comes to finding and rescuing victims.

When websites are shut down, the sex trade is pushed underground and sex trafficking victims are forced into even more dangerous circumstances, Bruggeman said. Under SESTA, trafficking victims face even more violence, are less likely to be identified, with less evidence of their victimization.

SESTA boasts of being the answer to uncovering and punishing those engaged in sex trafficking online, but what it actually is about is internet censorship, Briq House, communications director for the Sex Worker Outreach Project-USA, which promotes the decriminalization of sex work, wrote last summer. Without proper ways to establish identity, set service boundaries and screen people properly, this bill could turn casual meet-ups into life-or-death situation.

This bill targets the business model of companies like Backpage.com by opening the door to civil liability and allowing states to enforce their trafficking laws when online entities choose to profit from the exploitation of sex trafficking victims, Christine Raino of Shared Hope International, a religious-based organization focused on preventing sex trafficking, wrote in support of the measure. Major websites including Facebook, Google and Oracle also support SESTA.

I live in California, and Kamala Harris is my senator. It has been dispiriting, to say the least, to see her zeal in using law enforcement to crack down on voluntary sex workers in an effort to combat trafficking, Lola Davina, a former sex worker and author, told HuffPost. I wish Senator Harris would take the time to actually talk directly to voluntary sex workers to learn about their lives and livelihoods. Sex work is often an occupation of last resort that women, queers and trans folk fall back on when they have few other options .... Making their work even more dangerous, more marginal, more stigmatized, more difficult does nothing to help them  they are collateral damage in the fight against trafficking."
2018-10-29,The Huffington Post,Trump Fan Convicted In Anti-Muslim Terror Plot Asks Judge To Consider Trumps Rhetoric,"Patrick Stein was one of three right-wing militiamen found guilty in April of a conspiracy to kill Muslim refugees living in rural Kansas. Ahead of the 2016 election, Stein and two others plotted with an FBI informant and an undercover agent to bomb an apartment complex that housed Muslims in Garden City. Stein went by the handle Orkin Man and referred to Muslims as cockroaches he wanted exterminated.

At trial, defense attorneys referred to the defendants as knuckleheads who were engaged in locker room talk, and Steins attorney argued his client was a victim of a chaos news environment that had him thinking a civil war was coming.

A personal normally at a 3 on a scale of political talk might have found themselves at a 7 during the election. A person, like Patrick, who would often be at a 7 during a normal day, might go to 11. See SPINAL TAP.

A jury convicted Stein and his co-defendants, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright, on weapons of mass destruction and conspiracy against civil rights charges. They are scheduled to be sentenced Friday, a week after another Trump supporter was arrested for mailing bombs to the presidents critics and a right-wing extremist killed 11 Jewish Americans inside of a Pittsburgh synagogue. The government said it is seeking life sentences for all three defendants.

Steins attorneys, James Pratt and Michael Shultz, argued Monday in a sentencing memo that sending Stein to prison for life was unwarranted and that a sentence of 15 years would be appropriate. They said the judge should factor in the backdrop to this case when crafting an appropriate sentence.

2016 was lit. The court cannot ignore the circumstances of one of the most rhetorically mold-breaking, violent, awful, hateful and contentious presidential elections in modern history, driven in large measure by the rhetorical China shop bull who is now our president, they wrote.

Trumps brand of rough-and-tumble verbal pummeling heightened the rhetorical stakes for people of all political persuasions, they added. A personal normally at a 3 on a scale of political talk might have found themselves at a 7 during the election. A person, like Patrick, who would often be at a 7 during a normal day, might go to 11. See SPINAL TAP. That climate should be taken into account when evaluating the rhetoric that formed the basis of the governments case.

Steins attorneys, who called their client an early and avid Trump supporter, said it was important to keep in mind that almost no one thought Trump was going to win when evaluating the likelihood of an attack. The plot was supposed to take place after the election, as the group didnt want their attack to boost Hillary Clintons presidential campaign. Stein, in a message to an undercover agent, wrote that if they attacked ahead of the election it would give a lot of ammunition to the Hillary supporters and said that Clinton could never be allowed to be president.

Trumps win changed everything, and it is reasonable to speculate that it would have changed things among the defendants as well, the attorneys wrote. The urgency for action would be gone. The feeling of a losing battle would be gone. The conspiracies, in part, would be disproven as the transition from Obama to Trump took place. It is logical to conclude that the discussed attack would never have happened in the world that existed post-Trump.

Steins attorneys said their client got caught up in the anti-Muslim information he was devouring online. His knowledge of the Quran, his attorneys wrote, came directly from the internet and conservative talk-show hosts such as Sean Hannity and Michael Savage. Patrick himself had never read the Quran, nor had he participated in a comparative study of any religion.

Stein, his attorneys wrote, was the perfect, vulnerable target for the FBI, and had relapsed into alcoholism and had used methamphetamine regularly, including after he met FBI informant Dan Day. They said that Steins crimes demonstrated an extreme level of hatred and fear, but they also demonstrated an utter lack of sophistication."
2018-11-29,The Huffington Post,Republicans Give Up On Food Stamp Work Requirements For Farm Bill Deal,"WASHINGTON  For decades, House Republicans have wanted stricter rules for food stamp recipients  and this year seemed like their chance to finally make those provisions a reality.

Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House. They have broad support in their party for tougher food stamp rules. And President Donald Trump, not usually known for policy detail, has tweeted about the need for new work requirements five times.

So it may come as a bit of a shock in the coming weeks when Republicans put forward a final farm bill compromise that does not include the GOPs signature goal.

Senate Agriculture Committee chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said Thursday that the final version of the legislation will not have the tougher work rules Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had sought for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

We took a more comprehensive approach to provide program integrity, as opposed to extending age limits to moms that have kids that are 8 years old, so on and so forth, Roberts told HuffPost.

Over the summer, the Senate passed a bipartisan farm bill that included modest anti-fraud provisions, while the House passed a Republican-only bill with new rules that would have reduced program enrollment by more than 1 million over 10 years.

More than 38 million Americans receive monthly SNAP benefits that can be used only to buy food in grocery stores. The program already has work requirements for the subset of recipients who are able-bodied adults without minor children. The House bill would have applied the requirements to parents of children older than 6 and unemployed adults in their 50s, who had previously been exempt.

The Senate GOP was never as gung-ho as the House about requiring work for food assistance, knowing a farm bill would eventually need Democratic support in order to get the requisite 60 votes in the Senate for passage. But it hasnt been totally clear at any point during negotiations that Republicans would give in to the Senates provisions rather than just do a short-term extension and try to cut food stamps another day.

The House and Senate need to agree on a final compromise bill before any changes can become law. Roberts and several other members of the committee negotiating the final version said Thursday they were basically adopting the Senate version of the SNAP part of the legislation. But they declined to offer more specific details, saying they were waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to review the bills various titles. Roberts said that the language of the bill could still change if members dont like the cost estimates.

Im told Ill be happy, but I want to verify before I make any conclusive comment, said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Ma.), one of SNAPs strongest defenders in the House."
2018-04-16,The Huffington Post,In Searing Interview James Comey Unleashes Against Morally Unfit Trump,"Comey, speaking to ABC News George Stephanopoulos, touched on many of the scandals that have plagued the Trump administration over the past 16 months, including the Russia dossier and the litany of sexual misconduct allegations leveled at the president.

A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like theyre pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it, that persons not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds, Comey said.

The challenge of this president is that he will stain everyone around him, he told Stephanopoulos. And the question is, how much stain is too much stain and how much stain eventually makes you unable to accomplish your goal of protecting the country and serving the country?

The former FBI director said, however, hed still be working for the government had he not been removed. I was dreading it, Comey said, noting hed be an unhappy F.B.I. director, but in a way proud of the organization and in my role in trying to protect it.

Comey also recounted his conversation with Trump in which he said the president asked him to drop an investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump has denied doing so and threatened to release tapes of the conversation to prove so.

Comey reiterated that he hoped such tapes existed and said the secretive nature of the meeting might imply Trump knew he was flouting convention. If he didnt know he was doing something improper, why did he kick out the attorney general and the vice president of the United States and the leaders of the intelligence community? I mean, why am I alone?

I mean, its certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice. It would depend and  and Im just a witness in this case, not the investigator or prosecutor  it would depend upon other things that reflected on his intent.

Among the more salacious topics during the interview focused on the infamous Steele dossier that was compiled by a former British spy and alleged that footage exists of Trump watching prostitutes urinating in a Moscow hotel suite. Comey informed Trump about the allegations in private before his inauguration several times, and he writes in his book that Trump was obsessed with disproving them.

On Sunday, he said he was unsure if the rumors were true, but said they left the president open to blackmail by the Russian government.

I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I dont know whether the  the  current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013, Comey said. Its possible, but I dont know.

James Comeys publicity tour reaffirms that his true higher loyalty is to himself, Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. The only thing worse than Comeys history of misconduct is his willingness to say anything to sell books. He has no credibility and President Trump was right to follow through on the bipartisan calls for him to be fired.

As the reviews on Comeys tell-all began to pour in, Trump immediately fired back on Twitter, calling the man an untruthful slimeball and intimating that he should be jailed for his actions at the helm of the FBI. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later said Comey would be forever known as a disgraced partisan hack that broke his sacred trust with the president of the United States.

Trump unleashed another wave of fury on Twitter early Sunday, just hours before the ABC interview was set to air, accusing the former FBI chief of pushing many lies and predicting Comey would go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!"
2018-07-26,The Huffington Post,Why Are GOP Lawmakers Afraid To Stand Up To Trump This Race Offers A Clue,"Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle had maintained a lead for the GOP nomination in the states gubernatorial race since May, when he fell short of getting the 50 percent of the vote needed to win the nomination outright. He was considered the front-runner in the race, the one who had the best chance of taking on rising progressive star Stacey Abrams in the fall.

But it all fell apart when, in a surprise move, Trump endorsed Brian Kemp, Georgias secretary of state and Cagles GOP rival in the race. The announcement blindsided Cagles campaign and other GOP officials, including the leaders of the Republican Governors Association.

A leaked internal tracking poll for Cagles campaign that was obtained by a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed how the lieutenant governors poll numbers nose-dived after Trump endorsed Kemp, who cruised to victory Tuesday.

The dramatic boost for Kemp is a testament to Trumps enduring sway on the Republican electorate, despite growing criticism from GOP officials about his trade policies and his disastrous summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The president did not change the outcome, but it significantly impacted the margin, which means he had a very positive effect, Sen. Jonny Isakson (R-Ga.) said Wednesday of Trumps endorsement.

Trumps hold over the GOP voter base similarly explains the growing irrelevance of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), one of the presidents loudest critics, who is retiring this year. A Democratic poll that was conducted in September of 2017, about a month before Flake announced his decision to retire, found the Arizona Republican with an abysmally low approval rating among GOP primary voters.

While Flake has not let up in criticizing Trumps words and actions, including what he called the presidents Orwellian attempts at bending truths he did not like into an alternative reality, he has so far refrained from taking substantive action to force him to change his behavior. As a conservative, Flake still supports many of Trumps policies and nominees.

In Kemp, meanwhile, Georgia has a Trump-picked gubernatorial nominee in the presidents image who touted his big truck during the campaign in case he needed to round up criminal illegals and take them home myself.

Asked whether Republican lawmakers factored in Trumps overwhelming popularity with GOP voters when considering whether to push back against the presidents policies, such as his planned federal assistance to the farm industry, a type of move they railed against for years, Isakson demurred.

I take the issues based on the issue, he told HuffPost. Trump is a viable force in any primary, Ill tell you that. Particularly in the primary."
2018-07-28,The Huffington Post,Melania Trumps Press Strategy Is Looking More And More Like Her Husbands,"The response on Wednesday was one of several recent examples in which the first lady appeared to take a page from the presidents media criticism playbook. Using similar rhetoric to that of her husband, she tweeted in May that the media is working overtime speculating where I am, referring to reports on how she had not appeared in public for nearly a month  unusual for a public figure such as the first lady.

I put positive tweets/readouts/videos out constantly, she wrote in an email. In my opinion, the media chooses to cover the more salacious gossip or silly speculation in order to get headlines or clicks. To be honest, I wish they would cover more of her work on behalf of children, rather than some of the things they choose to focus on.

These critical responses to press coverage have occurred in tandem with Melania Trumps gradual and at times rocky ascension to her position as first lady, often fraught with challenges and seen as arcane and sexist. According to scholars who have studied the communications strategies of first ladies, its yet another way in which Trump has taken a radically different approach to the role.

While it was common for previous first ladies and their staffs to push for positive news coverage, according to Myra Gutin, professor of communication at Rider University and author of The Presidents Partner: The First Lady in the Twentieth Century, they were rarely combative with reporters, she said.

When I first heard she was visiting the border, I thought, ""Wow, OK, thats a good thing."" Shes showing her concern for the children and their parents. And then, to have the nonsense of the coat. Myra Gutin, author of ""The Presidents Partner: The First Lady in the Twentieth Century""

HuffPost reached out to several press secretaries or communications directors for former first ladies, but many did not respond. Barbara Knight, who served as first lady Laura Bushs deputy press secretary, declined to comment specifically, but said in an email that she and other members of Bushs staff had a great relationship with the White House press pool and considered the reporters she worked with like family.

Usually what the East Wing does is they try to not come out with any negativity, unless they absolutely have to, Wright said. And that usually comes from a West Wing staffer, if it is negative. They try to retain this status thats really positive, the image that first ladies have, so they dont want to tarnish that in general.

Both Wright and Gutin also cited an apparent lack of attention to optics. Wright noted that its crucial for advisers to the first lady to anticipate what the effect of this messaging might be, or what the downside might be, because first ladies are traditionally positive assets for presidential administrations, deployed to bolster their spouses policies and serve as a compelling surrogate on the campaign trail.

She has experiences that other Trump family members and surrogates do not. Any other administration would look at those life experiences that she has had and really try to leverage them, politically speaking.

2018-11-18,The Huffington Post,Trump Tells Fox News He Didnt Know About Matt Whitakers Past Criticism Of Mueller Probe,"President Donald Trump told Fox News he wasnt aware Matt Whitaker was a sharp critic of special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation before he named him acting attorney general.

In an interview that aired on Fox News Sunday, Trump told host Chris Wallace he didnt know Whitakers past remarks on the Russia probe, but that he didnt believe it would have any impact on the investigation.

Hes right, Trump said about Whitakers past criticism of the probe. What do you do when a persons right?

Repeating his constant refrain that there was no collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia, Trump reiterated that Whitaker happened to be right in criticizing the Mueller probe.

Trump said he personally did not plan to get involved in any decision on the future of the investigation, but that it would be up to Whitaker on whether it continues.

Trump named Whitaker as acting attorney general as he announced on Nov. 7 that Jeff Sessions was stepping down from the post. Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor, had served as Sessions chief of staff.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have pushed back on Trumps appointment of Whitaker, who they worry could end or kneecap Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the president obstructed justice.

Whitaker, during an interview with CNN in July 2017, suggested that a potential future replacement for Sessions wouldnt need to fire Mueller to stymie the investigation.

I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment and that attorney general does not fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt, Whitaker said at the time.

In August 2017, roughly a month before his appointment as Sessions chief of staff, Whitaker penned an Op-Ed for CNN in which he suggested the Russia investigation was going too far and could be a witch hunt. Trump claimed last week that he hadnt met Whitaker prior to appointing him to head the Justice Department, despite having told Fox & Friends in October that he knew him. I can tell you Matt Whitakers a great guy, the president had told the hosts of his favorite cable news program. I mean, I know Matt Whitaker. This story has been updated with Trumps past comments about knowing Whitaker."
2018-08-13,The Huffington Post,Carl Paladino Announces His Bid For Congress,"Carl Paladino, a Buffalo real estate developer and big Donald Trump supporter, announced Saturday that he intends to run for Congress in New Yorks 27th district. The seat is being vacated by Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who was arrested on charges of insider trading last week.

Paladino was co-chair of Trumps presidential campaign in New York. He most recently served on the Buffalo school board until the state education commissioner kicked him off in August 2017 for revealing confidential information about negotiations with the citys teachers union.

But members of the school board had previously voted for him to leave after he made racist comments in response to a local newspapers questionnaire about what he would like to see happen in 2017. Paladino said hed like President Barack Obama to die from mad cow disease and called first lady Michelle Obama a man who should go live with gorillas.

Paladino tried to downplay his comments and insisted they were not about race, and he later tried to claim that he meant to send them to only a few friends rather than the newspaper.

In 2015, Paladino bemoaned all the non-Americans walking around the University at Buffalo and specifically referenced the damn Asians coming here to go to school.

And in 2010, Paladino garnered national attention after WNYMedia.net published racist and sexually explicit emails Paladino sent to friends. They included a video called Obama Inauguration Rehearsal that appeared to be Africans dancing in traditional attire, racial epithets and pornographic images.

Paladino won the Republican nomination for governor in 2010, although he lost in the general election to Democrat Andrew Cuomo.

Collins initially said he was going to run for re-election but changed his mind on Saturday, allowing Republicans a chance to try to replace him on the ballot.

Nate McMurray, the town supervisor in Grand Island, is running as the Democratic nominee. The district leans Republican, encompassing wealthy suburbs of Buffalo and rural towns in the surrounding area between Buffalo and Rochester.

Paladino has plenty of competition on the GOP side. Erie County Comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, state Assemblymen Ray Walter and veteran and local radio host David Bellavia are among the others who have said theyre interested in the seat. Read a fuller list of the names that have been floated at the Buffalo News.

Interested candidates are competing to win-over the eight GOP county chairs in the district, who get to pick the nominee, if theyre able to get Collins name removed from the ballot."
2018-10-15,The Huffington Post,The Senate Judiciary Committees Only 4 Women Reflect On Kavanaughs Confirmation,"Bloomberg via Getty Images Senators Mazie Hirono (center) and Kamala Harris speak at a rally about Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings and the sexual assault allegations against the judge.

The only four female members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are angry that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and misconduct.

Women have had to put up with this bullshit for way too long, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) told New York magazines blog The Cut as part of the publications new Women and Power series.

Hirono, along with Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)  the only women among the committees 21 members  reflected on the controversial confirmation of Kavanaugh after Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford accused the judge of attempting to rape her when the two were in high school. Despite emotional testimony from Ford  and an angry denial from Kavanaugh  the Republican-led committee and the full Senate voted to install him for life on the Supreme Court.

I hope there will come a time when people like Dr. Ford can come forward, tell us their stories, and not be called a liar. Not be mocked by the president, no less, Hirono told The Cut. But that requires a culture change. Notice that theres all this pushback now of men being so afraid, as though we women just sit around thinking up ways to accuse them of things.

Harris added that conversations about sexual violence and rape culture need to be public, especially in the wake of the Me Too movement.

We should be having this conversation out in the open, in a way that gives dignity and safety to survivors. And frankly, I dont think this process gave Dr. Ford the respect she deserves, Harris said.

Ford quickly became a target of online harassment after she came forward, with people posting her home address on social media. Death threats forced her and her family into hiding. Even after Kavanaugh was confirmed, Ford and her family have been unable to return home due to ongoing security issues.

Women are credible, they are believable, they are electable, said Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee. But I dont think the cultures changed to the point where women are respected for what they do to the extent they should be.

In politics, power is when you get something done for the people you represent, she said.

Sometimes the result is a bill gets passed; sometimes its getting something done for a constituent, Klobuchar continued. But sometimes its just making people know that you have their back and that youre a voice for them, which is what I think happened at the hearing."
2018-11-07,The Huffington Post,Rashida Tlaib Ilhan Omar Win Become First Muslim Women Elected To Congress,"Democrats Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota both won their races for House seats on Tuesday, becoming the first Muslim women ever elected to Congress.

Omar will fill the seat of Rep. Keith Ellison (D), who was the first Muslim person elected to the body and left his seat to run for state attorney general.

After both facing crowded primary races, the progressive candidates were all but guaranteed to win in the general election, with Tlaib facing no Republican challengers in Michigans 13th District, and Omar the favorite to prevail in Minnesotas solidly Democratic 5th District.

Tlaib, 42, and Omar, 37, were part of a record number of Muslim candidates who ran in 2018, and an unprecedented number of women  specifically women of color  who were nominated.

I stand here before you tonight as your congresswoman-elect with many firsts behind my name, Omar said in her victory speech, to loud cheers and applause. The first woman of color to represent our state in Congress, the first woman to wear a hijab, the first refugee ever elected to Congress and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress.

Congress member-elect Ilhan Omars first words upon taking the stage: asalamu alaikum. The next words: al hamdulillah. My grandfather taught me that when you see injustice, you fight back. You do not give in to sorrow, you do not give in to sadness. You organize. pic.twitter.com/vyuYOKeC0r  Hannah Allam (@HannahAllam) November 7, 2018

Tlaib and Omar are also part of a wave of progressive Democrats headed to Congress, seeking to push the party establishment further left and supporting policies like Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage.

They join other women of color who made history on Tuesday  and who together will shake up the makeup of the overwhelmingly white and male halls of Congress: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress, and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts the first black congresswoman in her state.

Alexandria, Ilhan, Ayanna. I love these names! Tlaib said at a September summit celebrating women of color in politics. Yes, youre going to have to learn how to say our names.

Tlaib also became the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress on Tuesday. The Detroit-born mother of two first made history in 2008 as the first Muslim woman in the Michigan legislature.

I want you to know my mom, who is from a small village in the West Bank, theyre literally glued ... to the TV  my grandmother, my aunts, my uncles in Palestine  are sitting by and watching their granddaughter, the 42-year-old daughter of Palestinian immigrants said after her win, bursting into tears.

I want them to know as I uplift the families of the 13th Congressional District, Ill uplift them every single day being who I am as a proud Palestinian-American woman, she added, noting that for so many years Palestinians have felt dehumanized.

Omar  who was born in Somalia and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the U.S. at age 12  became the first Somali-American elected to Congress Tuesday. She previously made history when she was elected to the Minnesota House in 2016, becoming the nations first Somali-American legislator."
2018-10-30,The Huffington Post,Trump Says Hell Put Any Asylum Seeker From Migrant Caravan In Tent Cities,"President Donald Trump said Monday on Fox News that he planned to put any members of the migrant caravan who apply for asylum into new tent cities that would be all over the place, sharpening his recent efforts to politicize the southern border ahead of next months midterm elections.

Were catching; were not releasing, Trump said in the interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham. So if they want to come over, were not even doing that. Were not letting them into this country. If they apply for asylum, were going to hold them until such time as their trial takes place.

The president said he would order the construction of tent cities thatd be very nice. But he said he wouldnt spend hundreds of millions of dollars on structures to house anyone detained while awaiting the outcome of an asylum application.

Were going to put tents up all over the place, Trump said, before noting that theyre going to wait, and, if they dont get asylum, theyre going to get out.

His comments come amid nationwide attention over a 3,500-member migrant caravan that has traveled through Central America and into Mexico on its way to the U.S. border, where many people traveling in the group plan to apply for asylum after fleeing violence in Honduras. Trump said Monday he planned to deploy 5,200 troops to the region by the end of the week, even though the caravan itself, in which people are traveling mostly on foot, is weeks away from the border.

Critics have accused the White House of using the U.S. military to rally voters ahead of the midterms, especially since Republicans face a tough battle to retain control of the House of Representatives.

Having manufactured a crisis around the caravan, Trump is now explicitly vowing to waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money on it. When it comes to children, immigration detention is never appropriate under human rights law, Long said in an email to HuffPost. The detention of asylum seekers should be avoided apart from short periods necessary for screening.

Trump on Monday once again made baseless claims to Ingraham that many in the caravan were bad people, some of whom he said were in gangs. Hes repeated such refrains at campaign rallies in recent weeks, attacking his Democratic opponents as the party of crime and of open borders.

In July, a federal judge barred the Trump administration from issuing blanket detention of asylum seekers and ordered they be freed while their applications were pending as long as individuals werent a flight risk or didnt pose a threat to national security.

Its becoming increasingly harder to be granted asylum in the United States, according to new Department of Justice figures released Friday. The agency is approving asylum cases at the lowest rate in almost two decades as the White House has moved to roll back the circumstances under which foreign citizens are able to apply for such protections, an analysis by BuzzFeed News found.

The Migration Policy Institute found just 33 percent of asylum applications had been approved in the 2018 fiscal year, down from an average of 44 percent to 55 percent under President Barack Obama. The last time the approval rate slipped that low was 1999."
2018-10-27,The Huffington Post,Trumps Military Response To Migrant Caravan Foreshadows A Dark Long-Term Climate Policy,"GUILLERMO ARIAS via Getty Images A child in the caravan of roughly 7,200 Central American migrants headed north to the U.S.-Mexico border.

Now  with the White House poised to gut the federal governments only two major rules to reduce planet-warming emissions, and Trump threatening to cut aid to drought- and violence-afflicted Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador  critics say the administrations strategy to deal with climate change is taking shape, frustrating national security experts who say hunkering down and militarizing borders will do little to mitigate global warmings threats.

A quasi-fascist policy of fear-mongering about immigration and corresponding militarization of the border is clearly the major thrust of Trumps response to the mounting impacts of climate chaos, said Ashley Dawson, author of Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change.

Despite the repeated dismissals of climate science by the president and many of his top advisers, the Trump administration officially forecasts that the planet is expected to warm by 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century  a projection buried in a 500-page environmental impact statement in August.

Thats roughly double the temperature scientists say will cause cataclysmic drought, storms and sea level rise, and roughly four times the warming the planet has already experienced since the pre-industrial era. Under those conditions, more than 1 billion people globally could be forced to flee their homes by 2050, and 2 billion by 2100. Tropical regions  where many of the roughly 20,000 to 40,000 migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border each month in the past year came from  are expected to be hit the hardest.

Its difficult to draw a direct line between climate change and a migrants decision to leave home, and neither the United Nations nor nearly any other major countries currently offer legal avenues for asylum seekers fleeing the effects of global warming. New Zealand became the first country late last year to create a special status for climate refugees with 100 annual visas as low-lying island nations in its corner of the Pacific face existential threat of sea-level rise. On the opposite side of the ocean, a hotter climate is expected to parch once fertile lands. In an email, Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers University climate researcher, said its likely that increasing drought in Central America is making it more difficult for farmers there to make a living.

The President had willing partners in Congress and could have worked on immigration, border security, DREAMers and all that, Joseph Majkut, director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank, said in an email. But he didnt take advantage of that opportunity. Having missed the chance to seek actual reforms, we now get a militaristic and hasty response to a predictable stress.

Climate change [is] contributing to make nations unstable, both nations in our neighborhood and others abroad, said Femia, whose Washington-based policy institute includes former top national security advisers. The best way, from a security perspective, is to bolster the resilience of those countries so you reduce the likelihood of instability, reduce the likelihood of conflict and reduce the likelihood of displacement that might force outward migration.

That doesnt seem likely in the near term. The president attempted to cut funding for United States Agency for International Development by 33 percent this year, though bipartisan support for the federal governments dedicated aid agency staved off the proposal.

By deporting hundreds of thousands of Central Americans from the United States, the administration, like the Obama administration before it, is bolstering gang recruitment in countries like El Salvador, according to a December report from the International Crisis Group. That worsens the violence that many cite as a main reason for fleeing northward."
2018-07-27,The Huffington Post,Sen Claire McCaskill Confirms Russian Hackers Tried To Infiltrate Her Office Network,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri says Russian hackers tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate her Senate computer network, raising questions about the extent to which Russia will try to interfere in the 2018 elections.

McCaskill, who is up for re-election this year, confirmed the attempted hack after The Daily Beast website reported that Russias GRU intelligence agency tried to break into the senators computers in August 2017. The Daily Beast report Thursday was based on the sites forensic analysis after a Microsoft executive said last week that the company had helped stop email phishing attacks on three unidentified candidates.

While this attack was not successful, it is outrageous that they think they can get away with this, she said. I will not be intimidated. Ive said it before and I will say it again, Putin is a thug and a bully.

Her office would not give any details about the attempted attack or say how they learned about it. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he did not have immediate comment. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday night.

McCaskill, a Democrat in a state that overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump, is considered one of the most vulnerable senators up for re-election this year. According to The Daily Beast, the email phishing scam that targeted her office was similar to a successful Russian hacking of Democrat Hillary Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta, in 2016.

The report comes two days after Trump suggested that the Russians may try to help Democrats in this election cycle. He has repeatedly questioned the extent to which Russia interfered in the 2016 elections despite an assessment from the countrys intelligence agencies that they did. The intelligence agencies said Russia was attempting to help Trump win the election.

Im very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely dont want Trump!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2018

Trump tweeted Tuesday, without evidence: Im very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely dont want Trump!

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said the news confirms what he and others have warned for some time.

The Russians saw 2016 as a success, and theyll be back in 2018, unless we do far more to protect ourselves than were currently doing, Warner said, Unfortunately, the lack of leadership from the White House means that we still have no all-of-government approach to addressing this threat."
2018-05-30,The Huffington Post,GOP Rep Trey Gowdy Contradicts Trump On Informant Claim,"Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said the FBI acted appropriately when it used an informant to gather information about Donald Trump campaign advisers who allegedly had suspicious contacts linked to Russia prior to the 2016 election.

I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got, and that it has nothing to do with Donald Trump, Gowdy said Tuesday during an interview on Fox News.

Gowdy last week attended a classified DOJ briefing alongside other top lawmakers regarding the informant and the tactics the FBI had used during the 2016 campaign. The South Carolina congressman, who is retiring this year, is the first GOP lawmaker briefed on the informant to directly rebut Trump and his allies regarding the surveillance claims.

Trump has ratcheted up his attacks against the Russia investigation, the Justice Department and the FBI in response to the revelation. He claimed the agency infiltrated and spied on his campaign under the orders of President Barack Obama, and he demanded that the Justice Department investigate the accusations and turn over any relevant documents to Congress.

Trump again tore into the FBI during a rally in Nashville on Tuesday evening, insisting that his campaign had been infiltrated by his political opponents. Can you imagine? he said, to boos in the audience.

But Gowdy maintained the FBI was simply following Trumps orders when it investigated his campaigns ties to Russia.

President Trump himself in the [former FBI Director James] Comey memos said, If anyone connected with my campaign was working with Russia, I want you to investigate it, Gowdy said Tuesday on Fox News. Sounds to me like that was exactly what the FBI did.

Gowdy faulted Democrats, however, for not specifying that Trump isnt the target of the investigation. This had nothing to do with Donald Trump."
2018-02-28,The Huffington Post,Don Young Suggests The Holocaust Happened Because Jewish People Werent Armed,"In just the last decade of his lengthy tenure, Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) has made quite a few bizarre and insensitive comments, saying the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was not an environmental disaster, using a racial slur to describe Latinos and suggesting wolves could solve homelessness, among other controversies.

Last week, Young, who is currently the longest-serving member of the House, weighed in on the national debate on firearms by suggesting the Holocaust could have been avoided if Jewish people had armed themselves.

How many millions of people were shot and killed because they were unarmed? Fifty million in Russia, because their citizens werent armed, Young said during a conference in Juneau, Alaska Public Media reported.

How many Jews were put in the ovens because they were unarmed? he added.

The Anti-Defamation League rejected the idea that guns could have prevented the mass murder of up to 6 million Jewish people and millions of others during World War II.

Its offensive for anyone to manipulate the history of the Holocaust to score political points, the Jewish civil rights organization tweeted in response to Youngs comments, noting that the real causes of the genocide were anti-Semitism and hate.

Guns, or lack of them, did not cause the Holocaust. The Holocaust was the product of anti-Semitism & other forms of hate. Its offensive for anyone to manipulate the history of the Holocaust to score political points. https://t.co/OdB2w6XYro  ADL (@ADL_National) February 28, 2018

He was referencing the fact that when Hitler confiscated firearms from Jewish Germans, those communities were less able to defend themselves. He was not implying that an armed Jewish population would have been able to prevent the horrors of the Holocaust, but his intended message is that disarming citizens can have detrimental consequences, the statement read.

The ADL denounced a similar argument from a politician in 2015, when then-presidential candidate Ben Carson claimed in a section of his book, A More Perfect Union, that Through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda, the Nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance.

Pro-gun advocates have long argued that gun control was key to the German Nazi partys rise to power. But historians say that gun regulations were actually loosened for non-Jewish Germans, and many do not believe the limited number of personal firearms in Germany could have made an impact anyway."
2018-08-23,The Huffington Post,Trump Suggests Cooperating With Prosecutors Should Be A Crime,"President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that flipping to make a deal with prosecutors almost ought to be outlawed, and falsely claimed that his former personal attorney Michael Cohens crimes werent crimes.

In an interview with his favorite cable news show, Fox & Friends, that aired Thursday, Trump continued to lambaste Cohen, who pleaded guilty Tuesday to violating campaign finance laws at Trumps direction.

The president tried to distance himself by downplaying Cohen as one of many lawyers who have worked for him, adding that Cohen worked only part time.

You know, they always say the lawyer, and then they like to add the fixer, Trump said of Cohen. Well, I dont know if he was a fixer, I dont know where that term came from. But hes been a lawyer for me. Didnt do big deals, did small deals. Not somebody who was with me that much.

Trump added that he was somebody who was with me for probably about 10 years.

He worked for me  you could really say it was more or less part time, Trump continued. He had other businesses. He had other clients. Im not his only client.

But when asked if he directed Cohen to make the 2016 payments to silence Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in order to keep them from going public with alleged extramarital affairs, Trump pinned the blame on Cohen.

Trump falsely asserted that Cohens campaign finance violations arent even a crime and werent campaign finance  before pivoting to Cohens other charges outside of Trumps campaign related to tax fraud and his taxicab business.

A federal jury in Alexandria, Virginia, on Tuesday convicted Manafort for eight criminal counts related to tax fraud and money laundering, occurring nearly simultaneously to Cohens plea deal with federal prosecutors in New York.

In Thursdays interview, Trump again tried to claim that Manafort  who served as his campaign chairman during a critical time in 2016  barely worked for his campaign, and said that he didnt know Manafort well.

Asked about Trumps suggestion that flipping to make a deal with prosecutors should be a crime, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) seemed baffled.

Uh, I have to think about that a little more. Thats, uh  Ive never heard that argument before, Cornyn told reporters on Capitol Hill."
2018-07-21,The Huffington Post,Democrats Denounce Ivanka Trump For Hypocrisy After She Touts American Jobs,"The Democratic Party issued a scathing takedown of Ivanka Trump for gushing about the creation of American jobs while her own products are made exclusively overseas.

While Ivanka Trump is busy writing op-eds calling on American companies to create more jobs ... workers in countries like Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India are busy, too  working in conditions below industry standards to manufacture clothing and shoes for the first daughters namesake brand, said the statement issued Thursday by the Democratic National Committee.

The DNC statement, titled Ivanka Trump Is A Hypocrite, attacked the first daughters faux feminism and the reportedly poor working conditions and low wages at her overseas factories, which employ mostly women.

A senior White House adviser for her father, the younger Trump has praised the presidents new National Council for the American Worker and U.S. companies commitments to hire in the U.S.

The White House is also portraying the first daughter as a champion of the U.S. worker.

According to an investigation last year by The Washington Post, none of Ivanka Trumps products  including clothing, jewelry, handbags and shoes  are manufactured on U.S. soil. Factory standards for Trump-brand products lag behind those in other businesses in the U.S. apparel industry when it comes to monitoring the treatment of the largely female workforce overseas, the Post reported. Many American companies use outside auditors to ensure that factories comply with their conditions.

Workers making Ivanka Trump-branded products have complained of union intimidation, subsistence wages, long, exhausting hours, verbal abuse and sporadic compensation for overtime work, The Post and The Guardian reported last year.

In some factories, women were paid so little that they needed to leave their children with their parents to save money, according to the Post investigation, even as the first daughter pushes for paid parental leave and a better work-life balance for mothers.

Ivanka Trumps attorney Jamie Gorelick told The Post that the first daughter was concerned about negative reports about the treatment of factory workers toiling overseas for her brand, adding that she expects the company will respond appropriately.

Trump stepped back from running her company after her father invited her to work at the White House. But she still owns and profits from the company.

The company has been relatively upfront about manufacturing overseas  though it has not provided a list of facilities for further media scrutiny. The president of the Ivanka Trump brand, Abigail Klem, told a Washington Post writer for a PBS report last year that its simply unrealistic to manufacture products in the U.S. because of costs and because there arent enough workers here trained for the apparel industry."
2018-05-15,The Huffington Post,Most People Think Theyre Being Civil About Politics Their Opponents Disagree,"Most Americans believe that theyre pretty respectful about their own political opinions, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds  but few believe that their political opponents are paying them the same courtesy.

Nearly 80 percent of the public says that they are generally at least somewhat civil and respectful when it comes to politics, with 71 percent saying their friends and family are as well. But 40 percent or fewer think that civility is practiced by President Donald Trump, his supporters and opponents, the media, or politicians on either side of the aisle. Barely over a third consider it an apt descriptor of the nation as a whole.

Voters who supported Trump in the last election say that the president, his supporters and GOP politicians are usually respectful and that the media, Democrats and Trumps opponents are not. Voters who backed Hillary Clinton take the polar opposite view, although both sides largely agree that the nations political discourse has become something less than genteel. The rest of the nation  non-voters, and those who backed another candidate in 2016  largely dont think that anyone beyond their immediate circle is being polite.

Whether each of these camps should try to be civil, of course, is far from a settled question  one most recently most recently illustrated by the controversy over the White House Correspondents Association Dinner speech. That dust-up mirrored larger rifts among the presidents opponents over whether when they go low, we go high is still an approach that works in the Trump era.

Two-thirds of Clinton voters say its very important to them that political discourse is civil and respectful, compared to just under half of Trump voters who say the same. Only 35 percent of non-voters and third-party voters place an equal level of importance on civility.

Asked directly about their approach to the White House, however, Clinton voters say by an 18-point margin, 49 percent to 31 percent, that its more important for Trumps opponents to do everything they can to oppose his policies than it is to respect the current norms of the American political system. (Just after the presidential election, they said the same by a fairly similar 23-point margin.)

Within Clintons base, opinions on that question diverge modestly along several demographic and ideological lines. Age and education level dont seem to make much of a difference. But male Clinton voters are 10 points likelier than female Clinton voters to say Trumps opponents should do everything they can, regardless of political norms, while self-described liberals are 13 points likelier than those who call themselves moderate or conservative, and white Clinton voters 15 points likelier than her non-white supporters. Those Clinton voters who say they follow whats going on in politics most of the time are 24 points likelier to favor all-out opposition than those who pay less close attention.

2018-11-21,The Huffington Post,Federal Judge Shreds Trumps DOJ For Seeking So Many Delays In Census Trial,"ASSOCIATED PRESS The Trump administration keeps throwing up blocks in a case challenging Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

A federal judge in New York City strongly rebuked the Trump administration on Tuesday over its repeated attempts to slow down a lawsuit challenging the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman came in response to a request that he halt further proceedings in the trial until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on what evidence he could consider. The Supreme Court had rejected a very similar request to temporarily stop the litigation just weeks ago, the judge noted.

The judge, who sits in the Southern District of New York, did not hold back his frustration in his 7-page opinion, noting that the Department of Justice had submitted 12 separate requests to delay the proceedings since the Labor Day weekend.

Unless burdening Plaintiffs and the federal courts with make-work is a feature of Defendants litigation strategy, as opposed to a bug, it is hard to see the point, Furman wrote.

All along, the judge has expressed a desire to move the case along quickly, recognizing that any decision he makes is likely to be appealed to higher courts and that the issue needs to be resolved quickly so that the Census Bureau has time to print the census forms.

The lawsuit  brought by 18 states, the District of Columbia, several cities and a handful of immigrant groups  argues that the decision to add the citizenship question was motivated by discriminatory intent. They also say the decision should be set aside on the grounds that it was arbitrary and capricious.

In this latest effort to stall the proceedings, the Justice Department said that doing so would help conserve judicial resources, an argument the judge dismissed as galling.

If Defendants were truly interested in conserving judicial resources, they could have avoided burdening this Court, the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court with twelve stay applications over the last eleven weeks that, with one narrow exception, have been repeatedly rejected as meritless, Furman wrote. Instead, Defendants would have focused their attention on the ultimate issues in this case, where the attention of the parties and the Court now belongs.

The Justice Department appealed this latest motion to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit even before Furman had ruled on it  a highly unusual move that clearly annoyed the judge, who suggested the departments conduct in the case was sanctionable.

Defendants motion makes so little sense, even on its own terms, that it is hard to understand as anything but an attempt to avoid a timely decision on the merits altogether, the judge wrote. That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Defendants, once again, appealed to the Second Circuit even before this Court had heard from Plaintiffs, let alone issued this ruling on the motion."
2018-11-02,The Huffington Post,Obama Brings His Star Power To Florida For Andrew Gillum And Bill Nelson,"ASSOCIATED PRESS Former President Barack Obama rallies with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum (left) and Democratic Senate candidate Bill Nelson in Florida four days before the election.

If you dont like whats going on right now, dont just complain. Dont get anxious, he told more than 4,000 supporters jammed into the Ice Palace movie studios in a largely African-American section of Miami. Dont boo. Dont hashtag. Vote!

Obama had remained relatively quiet for the first year and a half of Donald Trumps presidency, but in recent months, with the midterm elections approaching, he has been hammering at Trumps policies and character.

Sounding relaxed in rolled-up shirtsleeves, Obama told his audience that Tuesdays election was critical for issues ranging from voting rights to the minimum wage to health care. He reminded them that major societal changes, from ending slavery to establishing LGBTQ rights, have often been followed by a backlash from the status quo  one step back for every two forward. Making this country better has never been easy, he said.

Demonstrators interrupted his remarks several times  and each time Obama tried to defuse the situation with humor. Why is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time? he said after the final protester was removed by security staff.

Obama won Florida relatively easily in his 2008 presidential run but more narrowly in his re-election bid four years later. He said defending his signature Affordable Care Act was one of the biggest issues on the ballot now and that Republicans  including current Florida Gov. Rick Scott, whos running for the Senate, and former Jacksonville area Rep. Ron DeSantis, whos trying to replace Scott as governor  have been trying to undermine and repeal the law for all eight years since it was passed.

Only now, with the midterms around the corner, he said, are Republicans saying they want to preserve one of its most important features: the protection of coverage for those with pre-existing medical conditions.

Thats some kind of gall. Thats some kind of chutzpah. Lets call it what it is. Its a lie, the former president said, adding that protecting the law was reason enough to return Nelson to the Senate. Florida, we cant let Rick Scott become the deciding vote.

Beyond the issues, though, Obama spoke at length about the angry rhetoric coming from Trump and his supporters as well as the most recent attempts to frighten voters with barely veiled appeals to racial animus.

Maybe most of all, the character of our country is on the line. In the closing weeks of this election, we have seen repeated attempts designed to make us angry and mean-spirited, Obama said.

He said fear-mongering tactics were not new  they were used in the midterms of 2010 and 2014 during his presidency. Now, in 2018, theyre telling you that the existential threat to America is a bunch of poor refugees a thousand miles away. Theyre even taking our brave troops away from their families for a political stunt, he said.

And as he has been doing in recent public remarks  and with the GOP touting strong jobs numbers released Friday morning  Obama pointed out that the strong economy that Trump and the Republicans now brag about is a continuation of the trend that began under his watch following the recession of 2008 and 2009.

Apparently right now the economy is so good. When do you think that started? he asked to laughter and cheers, adding that more jobs were created in the final 21 months of his administration than have been created in the first 21 months of Trumps.

Recent public polls show Gillum with a modest lead and Nelson with an even smaller edge. Using their voter turnout models, though, Republicans believe that Scott is likely to eke out a victory and that DeSantis could also win with a big Election Day turnout.

Obamas visit on behalf of Gillum and Nelson came sandwiched between two Florida trips by his successor. Trump staged a rally for DeSantis and Scott on the outskirts of Fort Myers on Wednesday and is scheduled to visit Pensacola on Saturday night. Both are Republican strongholds, while Miami is the biggest population center of largely Democratic South Florida."

But on Tuesdays live broadcast of ABCs Good Morning America, the former first lady joked about her 17-year-old daughter Sasha taking on Donald Trump.

I think, at this point, everybodys qualified and everybody should run, Obama told anchor Robin Roberts, prompting laughter from the audience.

I might even tap Sasha, she added. Sasha, you got some free time? I think youd do a great job.

Roberts asked Obama if she was saying that because of what we currently have. Obama laughed. You went there! Roberts added. You went there, Obama replied.

The former first lady, whose memoir Becoming goes on sale Tuesday, then told the host: Where I am is that right now we should see anybody who feels the passion to get in this race  we need them in there. And I think that the process will play itself out.

2018-10-30,Daily Beast,Ex-Rabbi at Site of Pittsburgh Shooting Tells Trump to Stay Away,"PITTSBURGHRabbi Chuck Diamond wants President Donald Trump to hold off coming here until after the funerals for 11 of his one-time congregants murdered by a gunman in the most deadly act of anti-Semitic violence in U.S. history.

I would plead with the president to wait, said the former rabbi at Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the mass shooting last Saturday. I also hope he would come in and offer his condolences after we have buried them and had a chance to mourn. The series of funerals began Tuesday.

Although details on exact time and place are yet to be announced the White House said Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will visit the Steel City Tuesday. Like all things related to Trump, the visit will be divisive in a way that has not been associated with former presidents. Some in the city are on edge over his failure to strongly and unequivocally condemn white supremacism after such a deadly and brazenly anti-Semitic act.

Trumps rhetoric is awful, Diamond told The Daily Beast and there are times when he needs to be stronger in his condemnation of rightwing violence. Diamond cites the Charlottesville rally after which Trump famously said, You also had some very fine people on both sides.

Diamonds pleas echoed those of Mayor Bill Peduto who cautioned Trump to confer with the victims families and warned that public safety dollars would be stretched to accommodate both the presidential visit and the succession of high-profile funerals. A former president of Tree of Life told Trump not to come, period, and a Pittsburgh branch of Jewish progress group Bend the Arc gathered more than 56,000 online signatures asking Trump to stay in D.C.

The mayor and county executive declined a White House invitation to join Trump, as did congressional leaders.

From her apartment in a nearby neighborhood Sarah Grumet, who grew up in Squirrel Hill, seethed at mention of Trump. He has spent two years preaching hate and xenophobia and violence and now he thinks he's wanted here and he thinks it's acceptable to come to our town when our whole town is sitting Shiva, said Grumet, 35, It's laughing in our faces.

She said she would prefer Trump spend the day refraining from Twitter or disavowing white nationalism.

Two nights after the shooting, Squirrel Hill sits in stunned silence. The continuous flashing of police lights continuously marks the crimes scene.

The street outside Tree of Life didnt open until Monday. With police cruisers and cable news vans surrounding the synagogue in the days after the tragedy, mourners left flowers in small piles on random street corners. The largest tribute is on a grass bank outside Chatham University.

The Squirrel Hill Cafe, the neighborhoods decades-old watering hole, was full on Monday night. A waitress apologized to patrons for the lack of seating at the bar. Customers were packed into the smoky, no-frills bar nicknamed the Squirrel Cage to drown their sorrows or discuss the latest developments in a quiet town that became the focus of international news on Saturday.

Randy Caputo, a 67-year-old retired U.S. Steel worker who now has an easy job at local motel, favors a visit from Trump, as long as he can mind his mouth.

I think it would be good to show his respect, said Caputo, who is also quick to inject that Trumps speaking habits cause him dismay.

The way he calls that guy in North Korea Little Rocket Man and that lady Pocahontas, I think he sometimes forgets hes president Caputo said. The only way you get respect is you give respect.

Chris Stalnaker, 36, taking a load off after working at a nearby eatery, is much less conflicted. I absolutely hate him, he said. I don't want him in Pittsburgh. I feel like he is inflammatory to every situation.

Id rather he didnt come here, said Matt Vandora, who is a bartender at the Squirrel Hill Cafe, shrugging his shoulders as if he was resigned to a presidential visit. He said he thought Trumps inability to comprehend things he says and how they affect people, made him act like a sociopath which was hardly what Pittsburgh needs right now.

Lesley Stewart, 25, heard the aftermath of the shooting unfold from her home a few blocks away. She said she was reluctant to speak out against Trumps visit because she didnt want to back up the notion that left-leaning people are intolerant.

Having said that she cannot forget what the president said after the murder at Charlottesville. Some good people on both sides, she recalled, which implies there are good neo-Nazis."

2018-02-13,Daily Beast,The Silicon Valley Giant Bankrolling Devin Nunes,"Weeks after they hired a controversial former Trump national security aide with ties to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA), top executives at the tech company Oracle made substantial donations to Nunes 2018 re-election campaign.

The donations, which totalled nearly $35,000 came from five executives, several of whom gave so much that they surpassed the legal limit and had to be refunded. What made the donations stand out, however, was not the size of them$35,000 was a relatively small amount considering the more than $1.2 million that Nunes has raised so far this cycle. It was the timing of the giving.

Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who worked as a top White House intelligence aide linked to former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, joined Oracle just weeks before its executives began writing checks to Nunes. Cohen-Watnick had arrived at the company under a cloud of controversy. During his time in the administration, he had been identified as having provided Nunes with reports that showed former National Security Adviser Susan Rice had requested the unmasking of several Trump aides listed in classified documents. That disclosure resulted in an ethics investigation into Nunes, who was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.

The unmasking scandal turned out to be vastly overstated. And it raised additional questions about Cohen-Watnicks qualifications for the job. He ultimately was let go from the administration in August as part of a staff cleansing by Flynns successor, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.

News that Oracle had hired Cohen-Watnick in its Washington DC office came in September. In early and mid-October, Oracles top officials began giving to Nunes. Edward Lloyd Screven, the companys chief corporate architect, wrote two checks to the congressman for $2,700 each that month. On October 16, Kenneth Glueck, a senior vice president, wrote two checks to Nunes for $2,700 each. That same day, Safra Catz, Oracles president, wrote a check to Nunes for $2,500. In late November, she wrote three more worth $5,200 (she was later refunded $2,500). Mark Hurd, CEO, would donate $5,400 in late November as well. So too would Oracles billionaire chairman and CTO Larry Ellison. He had $2,700 of his $8,100 in contributions refunded.

Oracle is a Republican outlier in Silicon Valley, and its executives right-leaning politics (and political contributions) present opportunities in Trumps Washington unavailable to competitors like Amazon, a frequent target of Trumps ire. Catz and Hurd are particularly close to the Trump administration, having both advised his transition team. Theyve also enjoyed personal access to high-level Trump administration officialsmost notably McMaster. Catz dined with him in July, a dinner over which the National Security Adviser reportedly called President Donald Trump an idiot and a dope. But neither Catz nor any of the other Oracle executives who gave to Nunes had donated to the the congressman before. Nunes does not represent the district where Oracle is headquartered.

The congressman does have influence over legislation involving government surveillance law, on which Oracle has spent a fair amount of money lobbying, including in the last quarter of 2017. Oracle has gone out of its way in the past to praise Nunes and his Democratic counterpart on the House Intelligence Committee, California Rep. Adam Schiff, for their handling of cybersecurity issues. The companys political action committee has donated to both congressmen. It would be slightly more than a month after the donations were made that Congress began seriously considering whether to extend, repeal or reform Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

But these five Oracle executives have not personally donated to Schiff this cycle or, for that matter, the chairmen or ranking members of the Senate Judiciary or Intelligence committees, all of whom would have played an outsized role in that debate over the 702 program as well. Indeed, for all but one of these executives, Nunes has been the only House member to whom they have donated this current cycle.

Oracle representatives did not return a request for comment. A source who works with the company said they were unaware of any fundraiser that would have been held by Nunes, at which the executives would have appeared."
2018-06-10,Daily Beast,To Ambush and Kill American Green Berets Al Shabaab Diverted a River,"The American soldier killed in Southern Somalia on Friday was part of a joint operation which had been in the works for years, The Daily Beast has learned. And by the time it began, the enemy was ready and waiting.

According to a U.S. Africa Command press release, combined force of Somalis, Kenyans, and Americans was conducting a multi-day operation to liberate villages in Lower Juba from Al Shabaab control and establish a permanent combat outpost designed to increase the span of Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) security and governance. Al Shabaab has been waging an insurgency to create an Islamic state in Somalia since 2006. In 2012, the group pledged its allegiance to Al Qaeda.

Late Saturday, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command confirmed the identity of the soldier killed as 26-year-old Staff Sgt. Alexander W. Conrad of Chandler, Arizona. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group. His specialty was gathering human intelligence.

African Union peacekeepers and American officials have told The Daily Beast that the missions objective was to establish a combat outpost intended to remedy problems American and partnered forces have had holding terrain retaken from Al Shabaab.

According to locals in the area, however, the increased presence of allied forces in recent weeks put Al Shabaab militants on high alert. The militants diverted water from the Jubba River to flood the area, compelling the joint force to build the combat outpost on a piece of higher ground where they were then ambushed on Friday.

The allied offensives target, the Jubba River Corridor, has long been a stronghold for Al Shabaab and one of its main transit routes into and out of northern Kenya, making the capture of the area a prime objective for allied forces. But poor weather, inadequate supplies, an insufficient number of soldiers from partner forces, and a lack of buy-in among key local and African Union security officials repeatedly has delayed the ambitious allied forces plan to retake the river corridor.

According to civilians in the area around Sanguni reached by telephone, two weeks before the attack on Friday in which Staff Sgt. Conrad was killed, Al Shabaab militants had taken a number of measures to protect their terrain: they told civilians living in the area to leave, they shed their military uniforms for civilian clothing, they brought in reinforcements from surrounding villages, and they dug out the banks of the Jubba River at a village called Jii-way, dumping the dug-up earth into the shallow riverbed itself to create a pseudo-dam.

As a result, water from the river began flooding the surrounding area making it nearly impassable: farms of mango and banana trees became wetlands and fruit and vegetable prices increased five fold in the nearby city of Kismayo as the remaining farmers left their land. They completely destroyed the nearby farms, the water reached as far as two or three kilometers from the river, said one local leader who preferred to remain anonymous for security reasons.

With the area now a marshland  a literal quagmire  the joint force was compelled to seek higher ground to build their COP in an area two kilometers away from the central village of Sanguni. The exact spot is called  Baar  or  Baarka Sangun i: once home to a bar run by the Italians who colonized the area and managed the farms along the Jubba River. Its situated on a hill under the shade of mango and banana trees, and in colonial times a semicircular wall enclosed a garden where Italians and well-to-do Somalis clinked wine glasses and enjoyed a light breeze coming off the river. By the time the joint force arrived with their trucks and excavators, physical remnants of that history were long gone.

Locals in the nearby village, Jeneraal Jay, who had fled their farms when they flooded, told The Daily Beast that on Thursday morning there was a firefight between Al Shabaab militants in the area and the allied forces in Baarka Sanguni. They said one civilian, a teenage girl, was killed in the crossfire. After the exchange, some families fled to the nearby town, Jamaame.

The following afternoon at approximately 2:45 P.M. local time, the roughly 800-strong joint allied force came under small arms and mortar fire from Al Shabaab militants, according to a statement by U.S. Africa Command. During the exchange, one U.S. service member was killed and four others were injured as was one member of a partnered force.

The death of the U.S. soldier is the first U.S. combat death on the continent since the Niger ambush in October and the second in Somalia in 13 months.

It comes as the Pentagon considers drawing down counter-terrorism forces across the continent. The proposed cut is the result of a review of American commando operations in Africa following the death of four U.S. soldiers in Niger last fall and is part of a wider discussion about aligning U.S. Africa Command operations with the new National Defense Strategy, which focuses on countering threats from global powers like China and Russia. If approved, the proposed drawdown would cut the number of American commandos in Africa by as much as 50 percent over the next three years.

U.S. Africa Command has some military presence in virtually every country on the continent, and while the proposed cut would likely significantly affect countries with already small American footprints, it may not have as large an impact in places like Somalia, which pose a more immediate terrorist threat and has long been a counter-terrorism project of the U.S., according to American security officials.

The Jubba River Corridor operation was itself the result of mounting political pressure. International donors to the AMISOM peacekeeping force have wanted it to demonstrate its effectiveness, which pushed AMISOM and its partners to finally undertake the long-planned offensive, according to American and AMISOM officials.

The European Union, the main financial donor to AMISOM, is currently reviewing its longstanding commitment to the peacekeeping force in light of new financial commitments related to security in the Sahel and migration to Europe. According to the Institute for Security Studies, E.U. officials are concerned about the effectiveness of the force given its lack of major offensive action since mid-2015. Countries contributing troops to AMISOM contend that the force has not had sufficient resources to undertake significant offensives in that time.

The sporadic operations AMISOM peacekeepers have undertaken have been criticized for their ineffectiveness. In recent years a familiar pattern has emerged in offensive actions by allied forces: joint operations would retake a town for a short time, but without the resources or troops to maintain a permanent presence, they would leave after a few days, and Al Shabaab militants would return. Though the tactic disrupts Al Shabaab activity for a short time, it does not allow for large swaths of territory to be retaken from Al Shabaab and put under the control of the Somali Federal Government.

In early February, a joint force of American Special Operators, African Union Peacekeepers, and the Somali National Security Forces retook Mubarak Town, the center of Al Shabaabs Mogadishu Attack Network which is used to create and move vehicle-born IEDs (car and truck bombs) from the Lower Shabelle region into Mogadishu. But a few days later, when many of the allied troops withdrew to a nearby AMISOM Forward Operating Base, Al Shabaab militants returned and threw scores of civilians in prison claiming they had passed information to the allied forces.

The Jubba River Corridor operation was supposed to remedy that sort of problem, and AFRICOM says it will continue. But Somali and AMISOM officials have expressed concern that the death of a U.S. soldier could stir the Pentagon to further restrict the operations of U.S. Special Operations Forces in Somalia, or increase the drawdown, which they say would disrupt an already fragile security situation.

All the security players  here play specific roles, Brig. Paul Lokech, Contingent Commander of the Ugandan forces within AMISOM, told The Daily Beast. If any of those players leave and no one else fills their role, it will leave a security gap, theres no question."

2018-04-11,Daily Beast,Reince Priebus Still Riding the Trump Train After It Rolled Over Him,"Reince Priebusnine months after he was ousted from his chief of staff role at the Trump White Houseis still on message, and in denial that there is or was anything amiss at the White House.

Priebus spoke at an event hosted by Georgetown Universitys Institute of Politics and Public Service, and reflected on his time in the chaotic West Wingadmitting that he sometimes got caught in the crossfire, and was careful not to mentioning the conflicts currently raging inside the West Wing.

He did not address his own ritual humiliation during his tenure as chief of staff (culminating with one of the first firing by tweet of the administration) instead he stuck to praising the presidents style, governance and even his Twitter feed.

When asked if he thought that the president adds into the anxiety surrounding government institutions, Priebus claimed that President Trump tapped into what voter thinks about institutions.

What they think about the EPA and [the Department of the] Interior, its not good, Priebus said. They dont like it. They think they waste money, and they have to pay for things to do nothing for their life. He failed to mention that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has been mired in scandal for weeks, starting with his $50-a-night Capitol Hill rental, and progressing towards his allegedly unnecessary spending habitsincluding federally funded flights back to his hometown and his alleged practice of punishing underlings who questioned his spending.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has been scrutinized for mixing official travel (and their expenses) with political events. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson also was recently grilled for his purchase of a $31,000 mahogany dining set for his office.

Priebus also said that Trump wasnt necessarily adding to the anxiety of major institutions, but he was simply forcing every department to look at itself. For example, he mentioned hiring freezeswhich he sees as a caring of these institutions. The State Department hiring freeze was highly scrutinized when it was put in place, and is said to have inflicted damage to the agency after former Secretary of State Tillerson rolled it back in February.

One recently retired diplomat told Foreign Policy that it still left the department worse off than it was before the hiring freeze. You dont get to call a partial fix of a self-inflicted gunshot wound a win.

He had more rosy words for the chaos in the White House, particularly about tariffs. He said that the internal debate slowed things down, but Trump eventually grew tiresome of the back-and-forth.

You should be comforted that there are people in front of president who are arguing tooth and nail, that are arguing [tariffs are] bad, Priebus told the crowd. Gary Cohn was making those arguments, but in spite of his best efforts, he went to the other side... [Trump] got sick of hearing people out, and returned to default position.

Priebus was steadfast in his praise for Trump throughout the short talk. Despite him attempting to get the president to toss Twitter while he was still in Trumps orbit, he talked up Trumps unique brand. He claimed the president has been good for party, and returned the GOP to party that thinks the American worker is worth fighting for.

He also said that no one in this generation could replicate what Trump did in 2016, musing that maybe another candidate in 30 years will turn to Trumpian tactics in campaigningbut no one could trump Trump right now. As far as the 2020 elections are concerned, Priebus has his pick made.

In the current situation [for the Democrats], things are not very good. Theres no way Kamala Harris or Bernie can do it. I think Biden is formidable, but I dont know if he can make it through a primary fight, Priebus said. It wont be easy, but if Dems dont think of something better, I think the president wins reelection."
2018-11-19,Daily Beast,Scouted CBD Products You Can Easily Add Into Your Routine,"As the world watches the debate on marijuana legalization, the other half of the drug that isn't as much of a debate has been quietly taking over everything from seltzer to bath salts. Introducing cannabidiol (CBD), a naturally occurring cannabinoid in the hemp plant, which offers all the anti-inflammatory properties of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) without the mind-altering effects.

Health conditions where CBD has great results include acne, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, autism, seizures, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel disease and syndrome, menopause, migraines, multiple sclerosis, nausea, premenstrual syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, and more, says Laura Lagano, integrative cannabis nutritionist, co-founder of the Holistic Cannabis Academy and author of The CBD Oil Miracle: Manage Pain, Improve Your Mood, Boost Your Brain, Fight Inflammation, Clear Your Skin, Strengthen Your Heart, and Sleep Better with the Healing Power of CBD Oil.

Its also a powerful beautifier and skin-saver, according to Dr. Jacqueline Schaffer, M.D., founder of Schique Skincare and author of Irresistible You: Smart and Schique Solutions for Clear, Radiant, Youthful Skin. She began singing its praises ever since mother began using it to alleviate painful skin cancer symptoms.

CBD oil has loads of vitamins and fatty acids, which help promote hair growth and strengthening of the hair follicles, she says. When it comes to skin, CBD oil benefits autoimmune-type skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis and people who fall into the dry and sensitive category. It also helps relieve pain, itchiness, and dryness.

But can there be too much of a good thing? Though CBD is not intoxicating, Lagano says, it is psychoactive. Thats why it works to regulate mood. You need to find your sweet spot for CBD, whether in an edible, tincture, gel cap, or spray.

This silky smooth serum seeps into your pores for maximum moisture absorption. Full-spectrum hemp oil harvested from Colorado (because where else?) works with Korean herbs like mulberry bark and Panax ginseng to breathe new life into tired skin. K-Beauty and CBD? These are the buzzwords that 2018 beauty dreams are made of.

Our eyes and lips are usually the first of our facial features to suffer from the effects of Arctic temps and, well, time. In this restoring eye and lip gel from Isidiol, Eidelweiss plant stem cells from the Swiss Alps and hemp oil work to even skin tone and stop the clock. Its like a two-in-one shampoo and conditioner for your face.

This restorative balm is for those problem areas that stay Sahara Desert-dry no matter the climate. Oolong tea and cocoa butter are your best defenses against the elements, while bioactive chlorophyll from virgin hemp seed carries oxygen to your cells, delivering long-lasting moisture. A little goes a long way.

Whether you watch cute dog videos on the elliptical or train competitively, protein is essential for repairing microscopic muscle tears and boosting muscle mass. Not only is protein crucial for recovery, but so is 300 milligrams of CBD isolate per container to help you come down from that runners high and into a clear-headed pain-free state of bliss.

Ginger and turmeric have long been celebrated for their powerful medicinal properties, both proven to alleviate nausea and reduce the risk of cancer respectively. Add five milligrams of CBD to the mix, and youre basically invincible. Here, water-soluble bioavailable hemp ensures every last drop of the good stuff dissolves into your tea.

Oh, honey. Whats that you said? Need a discreet shot of energy during the 3 p.m. slump? Each locally-sourced honey stick contains 10 milligrams of CBD-saturated hemp oil to mix into your tea, or gulp down straight (hey, no ones judging).

2018-06-12,Daily Beast,Heres Why Trump Looks Like Kims Bitch,"SINGAPORE  By Tuesday afternoon here, it was as if the signatures flourished by President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un on their joint statement had begun to fade already beneath the hot light of criticism. Analysts made the point repeatedly that the summit of the century had come and gone with very little to show. At least, not for Trump.

Sure, there had been a lot of tough talk beforehand. A senior White House staffer reportedly said the Trump Doctrine is, ""We're America, Bitch."" The optics and drama had drawn the superstars of television news to this island city state and, for a few days, gave the impression that Trump might be able to return home with one, just one, major foreign policy victory.

But when the document was seen (shown to the press by Trump when he showed off his signature) it was very hard to claim that the omission from the summit declaration of the hitherto sacred formula CVIDcomplete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearizationwas anything other than a huge concession to Kim Jong Un. He loathes the words that would actually compel him to surrender his arsenal.

Instead, Kim would only sign on to wording that says his country ""commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" which is by any standard pretty tentative language.

Until this week, CVID was supposed to be sine qua non: the sanctions would not be lifted until that was achieved. But at his rambling press conference after his morning of diplomacy, Trump even revealed the extent of the compromise hes willing to make: Complete has become, maybe, 20 percent.

That part of the press conference transcript is worth reading not only for its substance but also for its incoherence. (To be sure, Trump said he had not slept for 25 hours, but that probably was not the only reason Kim remarked earlier in the day that the whole scene was like something out of science fiction, or, perhaps in better English, that it was all pretty surreal.)

Trump admitted hed been told complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization could take 15 years, and he obviously couldnt square that with Kims demand for sanctions relief soon.

A 15-year process? Assuming you wanted to do it quickly, I dont believe that, said Trump. I think whoever wrote that is wrong. There will be a point at which when you are 20 percent through you cant go back.

How does Trump know this? I had an uncle who was a great professor for 40 years at MIT. I used to discuss nukes with him all the time. He was a great expert. A great brilliant genius. Dr. John Trump. MIT sent me a book on my uncle. We used to talk about nuclear. You talk about a complex subject. It is not just get rid of the  rid of the nukes. When you hit a certain point, you cannot go back.

How long will that take? We dont know, but it will be quickly.

At other times Trump resorted to the language of a declaration as signed by Kim and South Koreas President Moon Jae-in at the truce village of Panmunjom on April 27: We are asking for the establishment of a new U.S.-DPRK relationship, and when it came to verification of whatever the North Koreans were doing to get rid of their nukes and missiles, it will be verified as we develop a lot of trust.

Oh yes, Trump said, U.S. and international inspectors would be there to be sure Kim was living up to his word, but Trump seemed to have every expectation he would. He [Kim] was very firm, in fact, he really wants to do this.

In the real world, by any estimate, and with complete goodwill, given that the North Korean reactor at Yongbyon 60 miles north of Pyongyang has fabricated 40 to 60 warheads and the best spy satellites are incapable of revealing what else the North has going at facilities in caves and tunnels around the country, dismantling and verification are going to go very slowly.

Just as important as the sanction issue is the future of the 28,500 American troops in South Korea, many of them now headquartered at a sprawling, expanding base about 40 miles southwest of Seoul. I want to bring our soldiers back home, said Trump, reviving a mantra that he recited often during his presidential campaign. But, he added, thats not part of the equation right now.

Then, almost as an afterthought, he added, We will be stopping the war games  that is, unless or until its clear North Korea is not denuking as it should.

That announcement might be sensational considering that North Korea has objected strongly every time American and South Korean troops engage in joint exercises, most recently Max Thunder that featured warplanes from both countries zipping above the South for 10 days in May.

U.S. and South Korean generals, who love every chance they get to test their toys, let it be known they had not heard a thing about cancelling or even toning down the war games, which Trump described as provocative and expensive. (The word provocative is a favorite description of the war games in North Korean propaganda. Probably Trump heard it a lot before and during his meeting with Kim.)

A spokesman for U.S. Forces Korea had no updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises, notably a show called Ulchi Freedom Guardian that is staged each August involving thousands of troops. As far as the American forces in Korea are concerned at this point, he said, we will continue with our current military posture.

A South Korean official at the national security office was equally emphatic. There was, he said, no change at all.

Kim Jong Un, before taking off aboard an Air China plane in the evening, avoided any comment beyond the pleasantries that he had exchanged with Trump when they met in the Capella Hotel on secluded Sentosa Island,  but he seemed to have triumphed simply by making certain the document that he signed did not go beyond generalities.

Kim did agree on one added touch that Trump treated as a major victory  that was the last of the four points, which opened the door for American search teams to look for the bodies of about 6,000 U.S. troops still listed as missing in action from the Korean War. Trump said that on the campaign trail relatives of the missing often approached him asking what he might do about this if elected.

Trump neglected to mention, however, that in the past American search teams already visited North Korea in search of remains. U.S. diplomats have been raising the possibility of resuming searches in recent years, but those overtures were rejected when tensions rose dramatically in 2017. (One might also note that the image of American troops from the Korean war, as taught to the North Korean public in the famous Atrocity Museum, is nothing short of satanic.)

If the declaration appeared disappointing, Trump sought to give the impression the process would move at almost lightning speed. Kim, he said, might even begin issuing orders as soon as he arrives back in Pyongyang. He suggested there was already a deal, made after the declaration was signed, for Kim to shut down a missile engine test site which, Trump said, was clearly visible to U.S. satellites. Of course the big issue is not what the U.S. can see, but what it cant.

We have to get things moving fast, said Trump, blaming his predecessors in the White House for failing to resolve the problem of North Koreas nuclear program. It would have been much easier years ago, he said. I was given a tough hand just as he was with the Iran deal.

The comparison was unfortunate considering the Iran deal actually had stopped Iran from developing warheads or accumulating enough fissionable material to produce them.

Trump repeatedly deflected questions about North Koreas human rights record, distinguished as the worlds worst. He said he didnt really want that to get in the way of the summit negotiations, such as they were. Brushed aside were tens of thousands of prisoners in the Norths sprawling gulag system, along with Kims murder victims, including his half brother. In Trumps exercise of style over substance, he was not going to let human rights considerations deflect from delusions of success.

Instead, Trump preferred to accentuate the positive, the guarantees the United States is making to Pyongyang for the security of the Kim regime, and the bright future ahead for the people of whats long been called the Hermit Kingdom.

Hes going to be happy, Trump told George Stephanopoulos on ABC. His country does love him."
2018-09-20,Daily Beast,This May Make You Weep Miley Cyrus Sister Is Selling Her Tears Online For 12000,"According to every person who has ever coached their friend through a breakup, it takes more muscles to smile than it does to frown. But how many muscles does it take to slip into a pair of $60 Sadness sweatpants, bring a bottle of squeezy cheese into bed, and wallow your night away?

Noah Cyrus, the 18-year-old younger sister to Miley, might know.

In celebration(?) of the release of her EP Good Cry, Cyrus took it upon herself to release a line of sad-girl merch with PizzaSlime. Along with the sweats, Cyrus took one for the team and bottled up her own tears in droppers that can be yours, forever, for only $12,000. (But you should run, not walk, to this pity party, as the line is only available for 48 hours.)

The sell for the tears runs as follows: ""This is approximately 12 tears made by Noah Cyrus as a result of sadness. Human digestion of these tears is not suggested cause tears are generally pretty salty and that would just be super fucking weird if you drank someone else's tears.""

Roy Orbison may have had the best song to cry to of all time. Unlike the Big O, the Little Cs preferred method of music promotion is to capitalize off her generations alarmingly high rates of depression and suicide.

In August, Cyrus revealed to L'Officiel that she has struggled with anxiety and depression, and those issues reportedly inspired the self-admitted emo-ness of her sound. As she said, Ive been struggling with depression, and (its) okay to feel those feelings.""

There is a strength that comes through admitting your emotions are valid. Maybe for some, wearing the Sadness sweats and sry im trash hoodie are a way to rail against the stigma of talking about mental health issues.

Whether shoppers are getting exploited, or finally seeing representation they'd spend $120 on a sweat in pursuit of, is up to interpretation.

This collaboration comes one week after Cyrus reported split with the rapper Lil Xan (real name: Diego Leanos).

According to Leanos, the brief relationship was all a PR stunt. Cyrus, and Columbia Records have denied this claim.

Whether they were dating or not, such drama is enough for at least one round of $12,000 stress crying.

This isn't the first time a line has tried to make mental illness trendy. Back in 2014, Urban Outfitters was called out for selling a printed with the word ""Depression."" (The retailer later pulled the top from its shelves.)

Noah Cyrus' collection of sobbing accoutrements might make you go Whaaa? at first, but anyone whos been 1) sad and 2) had access to the Internet could have seen it coming. Depression is a main theme of Internet humor, particularly in memes.

Pictures of shy-looking puppies are accompanied by captions that describe the pressures of social anxiety. A photo of Kermit crying will include a joke about seasonal affected disorder. Even the New York Times has reported on the meme seen round the world of an anthropomorphic dog sitting calmly in a room on fire thinking, This is fine.

As I-D reported in 2017, these funny, digestible posts have helped open a dialogue about mental health. Great, right? Reducing the stigma of depression is all fun and games until PizzaSlime jumps in to fetishize female tears.

PizzaSlime was founded by Stoveman and Hobin, two humans who told Us Weekly they use the monikers to preserve a sense of anonymity. That mystery has only helped the duo earn fans of several Kardashians, Lady Gaga, and Diplo. Their M.O. is to keep a finger fixed on the pulse of what's going on in the tabloids, and produce pieces that make a statement about what's buzzy in entertainment land.

Quoth the Stoveman: ""We love pop culture because it gives you something to talk to your parents about and it's what you talk about at the office water cooler. We use pop culture as a way to be part of those conversations.

The line's clothingmostly t-shirtsare basically wearable memes, with purposefully low quality standards. One shirt reads ""Ugly But Honest,"" and looks like something you'd pick up for 50 cents at a yard sale.

PizzaSlime also sells a menagerie of millennial oddities such as a $15 used condom wrapper (sold out!) and a pack of Plan B (this is what happens when you deny women easy access to contraceptives, people!)

As for Noah's $12,000 tears, PizzaSlime reps did not respond for The Daily Beasts request to comment on how the liquid was collected, or if the bottle actually contained human tears at all. (Meanwhile, I'm waiting for the app that tells me how much my plebeian tears are worth.)

For anyone concerned over the fetishization of female malaise, consider the wise words of my favorite sad girls, Fiona Apple, at the 1997 VMAs.

This world is bullshit. . .and you shouldnt model your life about what you think we think is cool, and what were wearing, and what were saying, and everything. Go with yourself."
2018-04-23,Daily Beast,Waffle House Hero Is Raising Money for Attacks Victims,"James Shaw Jr., who grabbed the scalding barrel of an AR-15 to take it away from a gunman in Nashville who massacred four people and shot two others at a Waffle House on Sunday, has already raised more than $16,000 for the victims of the rampage.

Police are on the hunt for suspected shooter Travis Reinking, 29, who allegedly killed Taurean C. Sanderlin, 29; Joe R. Perez, 20; Deebony Groves, 21; and Akilah Dasilva, 23.

Shaw, who has been hailed as a hero by witnesses and authorities alike, created a GoFundMe account for those injured in the shooting, in which a nearly naked Reinking allegedly started shooting at a Waffle House at about 3:30 a.m. Sunday.

Please take the time to donate as all of the proceeds will be given to the families, Shaw, 29, wrote on the page. Thank you again for your generosity and blessings!

You dont get to meet too many heroes in life, Waffle House Chief Executive Walter Ehmer said of Shaw, at a press conference several hours after the attack. We are forever in your debt.

I was completely doing it just to save myself, Shaw, who was grazed by a bullet and treated for a minor gunshot wound, said at the press briefing. Now, me doing that, I did save other people. But I dont want people to think that I was the Terminator or Superman or anybody like that. It was just, I figured, if I was going to die he was going to have to work for it.

He added, It was life or death.

Nashville schools are on a lockout Monday as police continue a manhunt for Reinking. The affected schools have already been searched and cleared by local police, but no guests or visitors will be allowed inside until the suspected shooter is apprehended."

2018-10-17,Daily Beast,Stephen Colbert Slams Trump for Stormy Daniels Horseface Slur,"With the midterms just three weeks away, Stephen Colbert reluctantly gave President Trump credit for his victory in the defamation lawsuit filed against him by Stormy Daniels and her lawyer Michael Avenatti Tuesday night. As the Late Show host explained, a judge not only threw out the suit, but also ordered her to pay Trumps legal fees.

Now, OK, thats tough, but if shes looking for a way to raise money Ive got a good idea, Colbert said. Launch a GoFundMe campaign titled, For $10 million I will stop describing Trumps penis.

Colbert went on to say that he found the judges reasons for dismissing the case upsetting, given that he ruled Trumps tweet calling Daniels a liar was protected by the First Amendment because it was the kind of rhetorical hyperbole commonly associated with politicians in the United States.

Its only normal because Trump made it normal! Colbert exclaimed. Like how now its normal to be buddies with Kim Jong Un yet fear the cruel and devious Canadians.

And then there was Trumps tweet in response to the ruling in which he took advantage of the new normal by calling Stormy Daniels Horseface and threatening to go after her.

Yes, Horseface, Colbert said. You heard it straight from the horses ass."
2018-10-17,Daily Beast,Trump Defends Saudi Arabia Vladimir Putin in Flattery-Filled Fox Business Interview,"Following the disappearance and likely assassination of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, every major Western media organization pulled out of Saudi Arabias upcoming Future Investment Initiative, nicknamed Davos in the Desert. Every major Western news organization except one, that is: Fox Business Network.

Perhaps it was no coincidence that President Donald Trump chose that network as the latest stop on his flood the zone media tour, sitting down with newly installed prime-time host Trish Regan for a conversation in which he continued to cast doubt on the widely accepted conclusion that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had Khashoggi killed for speaking out against his regime.

It depends whether the King or the Crown Prince knew about it, in my opinion, Trump said, when Regan asked what action his administration would be taking against Saudi Arabia. If they knew about it, that would be bad, he added.

Saudi Arabias our partner, our ally against Iran, he said. Theyve been a great ally to me, he added, despite previous assertions that he has no financial stake with the Saudis. If the U.S. does give up its supposed $110 billion arms deal with the Saudi Kingdom, he asked, Arent we just hurting our own country?

The interview also contained plenty of flattery from Regan, who highlighted the enthusiasm of the crowds at Trumps recent rallies. She told the president that his economic accomplishments are significant and there is a lot to be proud of and dismissed with an eye roll the suggestion from critics on the left that the good news is just a result of President Obamas policies finally taking effect.

He didnt even help, Trump said of Obama. When I hear that and when professionals hear that, they laugh. Even professionals from the other side.

The hosts only response was, Sure.

Regan did ask Trump how he will overcome the Republican Partys terrible approval ratings among female voters but failed to correct him when he bragged about how well he did with women in the 2016 election. The president frequently conflates the percentage of women who voted for him (41 percent) with the percentage of white women who voted for him (52 percent).

The men stay with me, I dont know why, Trump said, making the host giggle.

At another point, Trump dismissed Michael Avenattiwhom he once again referred to as Michael Avianteas not a serious opponent for the 2020 election, reminding the host that he just beat him in a defamation lawsuit. Asked if he really plans to make Avenatti and Stormy Daniels pay his legal fees as a judge ordered, Trump replied, Are you serious? Of course, adding, Theyll pay a lot.

Towards the end of the interview, Trump was back to playing his greatest hits of no collusion! and witch hunt in reference to the Russia investigation. The president pointedly would not say whether he would keep Attorney General Jeff Sessions around after the midterms. I'm not going to tell you that, well see what happens. But I think it was a disgrace, he said of Sessions recusal.

In one of her more critical moments, Regan told Trump, I wondered why you werent tougher on Putin, referring to the Helsinki summit back in July.

Trump said it would have been easier for him to be tough on Putin, asking, They want me to go up and have a boxing match with him on stage? He admitted he was nice to Putin, but insisted everyone thought the performance was great before he got on the plane home and started hearing the fake news report that he wasnt tough enough.

In fact, the terrible reviews for Trumps performance on that stage in Helsinki were swift and brutal, from all sides of the political media spectrum. In addition to Regan, who called it horrible, several other typically fawning Fox News personalities pilloried the press conference as a disgusting display.

I think they are laughing at us, Trump said of Russia. This stupid investigation hurts us from having a great relationship. He repeatedly disputed the suggestion that Russia has tried to sow chaos in America and seemed bemused at that phrase, which he said came from Old English. As for his closed-door meeting with Vladimir Putin, Trump said he told him no more meddling, undercutting his own point in his next breath by adding, if you did meddle.

Just as the Saudi government has assured the Trump administration that they did not have Khashoggi killed, the president said Putin told him Russia did not meddle in the 2016 election. In both cases, he took their word for it. The last thing that Putin wants now is Trump, the president added, baselessly. Hed much rather have Clinton."
2018-03-20,Daily Beast,Charlotte Pence Is Surprisingly Cool With John Oliver Trolling Her Bunny Book,"As of Tuesday morning, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is still out-selling Marlon Bundo's Day in the Life of the Vice President by Charlotte Pence on Amazons best-seller list. And the vice presidents daughter seems totally chill about it.

Charlotte and her mother Karen Pence were on Fox Business Network with Maria Bartiromo to promote their new book when the host casually brought up the fact that Olivers parody book about a gay bunnyrevealed on his HBO show Sunday nighthad just knocked James Comeys upcoming memoir off of Amazons top spot.

I mean, I think you know, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery in a way, Charlotte said. But also, in all seriousness, his book is contributing to charities that I think we can all get behind. We have two books giving to charities that are about bunnies so Im all for it really.

Karen Pence stayed notably silent on the matter. But later, Charlotte Pence retweeted the Fox Business clip of her positive reaction to Olivers book.

Her comments deviate dramatically from the statement put out by her books publisher. Its unfortunate that anyone would feel the need to ridicule an educational childrens book and turn it into something controversial and partisan, a spokesperson for Regnery Publishing told CNN on Monday.

As for those charities that we can all get behind, they include The Trevor Project, which aims to help save young LGBT lives and AIDS United, which strives to end the AIDS epidemic in the United States. As Oliver pointed out on his show, Pence has a horrendous record on those issues.

The vice president has supported so-called conversion therapy for LGBT Americans and once proposed diverting HIV/AIDS funds towards  institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior. The Pences book tour will include a stop at the headquarters of the Christian conservative, anti-gay group Focus on the Family.

And while 100% of proceeds from Olivers book go to those charities, only an unspecified portion of the profits from the Pences book will go to less controversial non-profit organizations that focus on combating human trafficking and providing art therapy to children.

For the most part, Charlotte Pence has tried to stay mostly apolitical as she has promoted the new book. But there was a telling moment on The View Tuesday when co-host Sunny Hostin asked her about Marlon Bundos political leanings.

I dont know, I guess youd have to ask him that, she said. I think he kind of hops down the middle of the aisle. He brings people together.

Could she have been talking about herself?"
2018-03-13,Daily Beast,Trump in California Says You Wouldnt Even Have a Country Without Border Wall,"President Donald Trump said the country would not survive long unless a wall is built on the border with Mexico during a Tuesday visit to California to look at prototypes of the wall.

For the people who say no wall, if you didnt have walls over here, you wouldnt even have a country, Trump said. The president also said he wants the wall to have see-through capability.

The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas, added Trump.

Last week the administration sued California for its so-called sanctuary city policies laws allowing local law enforcement to refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials.

Demonstrators in California protested Trumps arrival and chanted No ban! No wall, the AP reported. San Diego Organizing Project member Cornelius Bowser told The Daily Beast, We value immigrants. Building a border wall is a waste of money.

Trump declared he would build a wall on the Mexico-U.S. border during his campaign announcement in June 2015.

""I will build a great walland nobody builds walls better than me, believe meand I'll build them very inexpensively, he said.

We will build a great wall along the southern borderand Mexico will pay for the wall, Trump reiterated during an August 2016 rally, shortly before election day.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto responded on Twitter that his country would never pay for a wall. Nieto recently canceled a meeting with Trump over continued disagreements over who would fund the border wall, per The Washington Post. This happened all despite Trump reportedly confessing to Nieto during an August 2017 phone call that the wall is actually the least important thing that we are talking about.

Days after his inauguration, Trump issued an executive order that called for the walls construction as a way to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nations southern border in order to lower the influx of undocumented immigrants.

Last year, the Department of Homeland Security said the wall could cost $21.6 billion, almost twice as much as Trumps $12 billion estimate during the campaign. The border wall factored into the immigration debate earlier this year when Trump declared that negotiations with Democrats over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program must include funding for the border wall, as The Daily Beast reported. DACA was set to expire on March 5 until a federal judge blocked the administration from ending the youth-focused immigration program."
2018-04-11,Daily Beast,Zuckerberg Gets More Questions About Diamond Silk Than Facebooks Role in Myanmar Genocide,"When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Capitol Hill this week, he was bound to face a variety of difficult questions ranging from his companys handling of user information to the proliferation of fake news over its pages.

For Republican lawmakers, however, the presence of the enigmatic CEO has provided them the opportunity to press on a separate, though related, matter: the treatment of a pro-Trump YouTube duo.

During the course of two days, at least four lawmakers have quizzed Zuckerberg over reports that Facebook flagged the content of Diamond & Silk as unsafe to the community.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) started it off by alleging that conservative American voices have been silenced by Facebooks content screeners and specifically cited Diamond & Silk, the flamboyant Trump boosters who began their career as a YouTube video duo and have since become Fox News regulars with President Trumps ear. (One senior administration official told The Daily Beast that the devoted duo have such a close relationship with Trump that they practically serve as senior economic advisers.)

The pro-Trump duo recently claimed that Facebook blocked some of their content because it was deemed unsafe to the community. A rep for the site confirmed this week that they were ""reaching out to the creators of Diamond and Silk to try to resolve this matter.""

This is actually a concern that I have... making sure that we dont have any bias in the work that we do, Zuckerberg told Cruz. I think it is a fair concern.

Zuckerbergs answers on Tuesday apparently did not suffice because during Wednesdays hearing on the House side, he was peppered with a handful more Diamond & Silk-related questions.

Why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as Diamond & Silk? Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) breathlessly asked. That is ludicrous. They hold conservative views. That isn't unsafe.

In that specific case, our team made an enforcement error and we have already gotten in touch with them to reverse it, Zuckerberg asserted.

Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) then set Zuck up for yet another Diamond & Silk-related dig. Do you subjectively manipulate your algorithms to prioritize or censor speech? she asked.

There are types of content like terrorism that I think we all agree we do not want to have on our service, Zuckerberg replied. So we build systems that can identify those and can remove that content and were very proud of that work.

Let me tell you something right now, Blackburn snarked in response. Diamond & Silk is not terrorism.

Moments later, it was House Majority Whip Steve Scalises turn.

The Diamond & Silk example, where you... described it as mistake. Were the people who made that mistake held accountable in any way? the Louisiana Republican asked.

Congressman, let me follow up with you on that, a stoic Zuckerberg responded. That situation developed while I was here preparing to testify, so Im notI dont know the details of it.

Facebooks treatment of Diamond & Silk gets to a larger issue of whether the private company views itself as an open platform for political content of any stripe, or whether it feels it can and should apply editorial controls. But the sheer number of specific questions about the pro-Trump pair was a remarkable illustration of how congressional hearings almost always devolve into partisan politics.

Later in the hour, Rep. Billy Long (R-MO) brought out a poster with Diamond & Silks picture, and read to Zuckerberg a question submitted directly by the duo. What is unsafe about two black women supporting President Donald J. Trump? was their question.

While lawmakers obsessed over Diamond & Silk, they almost completely ignored Facebooks role in Myanmars ongoing genocide.

United Nations human-rights experts investigating what has been described as the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people stated last week that the social-media platform is to blame for the rapid spread of propaganda and hate speech against the stateless minority.

Additionally, The Daily Beast reported last year, Rohingya activists found their posts documenting the genocide mysteriously disappearing from Facebook.

The only mention of this connection came Tuesday during the joint Senate commerce and judiciary committees hearing with Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

During his allotted time, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) repeatedly pressed the social-media titan on the matter, citing specific examples of violent propaganda that fell through Facebooks content-screening cracks.

Whats happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy, and we need to do more, Zuckerberg pledged. We need to ramp up our effort there dramatically. He vowed to hire more Burmese-speaking employees to help filter out the violence-flaming content.

As of press time, not a single member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked Zuckerberg about his sites role in aiding genocide abroad."
2018-11-08,Daily Beast,Lucy McBaths Win Puts the New Georgia on Full Display,"This is, frankly, not the column I expected to write today. After all, the pundit classmyself includedfocused on big ticket gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. Flipping the House was a forgone conclusion. Democrats won some close races and lost some others. The results, in so many cases, mirrored conventional wisdom. That is to say: There were few surprises.

And then came Lucy McBatha 58 year old Joliet, Illinois native and Atlanta transplant.

A single mother and retired Delta Airlines flight attendant, McBath first made national headlines after the shooting death of her son Jordan Davis, who was unarmed, as he sat in the backseat of a friends car in 2012. She had never thought about running for public office before, she is quick to say, but McBath would tell you that something in her changed when she was forced to bury her son.

Almost overnight, she became one the nations most recognizable gun control advocates. That notoriety, along with a healthy dose of elbow grease, helped her win Georgias 6th congressional district.  The incumbent, Karen Handel, conceded the election Thursday morning.

It was a stunning upset. McBath managed to do what Jon Ossoff could not in last springs closely watched special election: Turn out just enough Democrats and swing voters to flip an otherwise red-leaning district. McBaths experience as an activist certainly proved valuable as she campaigned door-to-door. She had next to no money, and Handel walked in as an experienced campaigner who previously represented parts of the district as a Fulton County commissioner and as a former Secretary of State.

Handel all but trounced Ossoff, who did not live in the district and declined to make a second bid, in the special election to replace Tom Price. It should be said that while Ossoff avoided gun rights issues, McBath embraced her role as a grieving mother who simply wanted reasonable reforms. Handel attempted to paint her opponent as an extremis, who was out of step with the good people of the north Atlanta metro. Even though McBath was polling ahead by a few points as Election Day approached, few thought she would actually win.

You see, as Andrew Gillum learned in Florida, the Bradley Effect is still real, 40 years after Tom Bradley ran for governor of California. Just as there are some people who will not tell a pollster that they favor Donald Trump, there are others who will publicly say they intend to vote for a minority candidate when they fully intend to pull the lever for their white opponent. Bernie Sanders is right when he says that white people sometimes have trouble voting for African American candidates, even if they agree with them on most of the issues.

Maybe that had some impact on the McBath-Handel race. But what we know for sure is McBath could not have won the right-leaning, majority white district without getting votes across racial, cultural and partisan lines.

In the end, the race was razor close. Both women went to bed Tuesday night separated by just 75 votes, knowing the race wouldnt be decided until at least sunup. Now, as of this writing, the dust has settled, and McBath won by more than 2,000 votes, or one full percentage point.

There is a certainly a tasty bit of irony that a previously unknown African American woman rose to the national spotlight, quickly emerged as a leader on gun safety issues and will now take former House Speaker Newt Gingrichs seat. It says something that Georgias 6 th congressional district was drawn specifically for Gingrich and its lines adjusted over the years to maintain it as a solidly Republican district.

The Atlanta metropolitan areas ever-shifting demographics all but guaranteed that the 6th would one day be a swing district and then become solidly blue over time. The fact is that more African Americans and Hispanic families are fleeing the city limits for the suburbs where taxes are lower and they can get more bang for their housing buck.

It took a coalition of white, black and Latino voters to put McBath in Congress.

I have worked in and around Georgia politics (or covered it as a journalist) for nearly half of my life. Eons ago (er, in the mid-80s), when I was in high school, the City of Roswell was practically all-white. Heck, I didn't even know that Alpharetta, Georgia existed until I was 25 years old. Both of those north Fulton County towns are decidedly more diverse today, even if they remain predominantly white, than they ever have been.

Then, too, Cobb and Gwinnett Countiestwo of the most populous in the state were once conservative bastions. In fact, no statewide contest could be decided without them and they were the reasons the GOP maintained a lock on statewide offices for the last two decades or so. For Republicans, winning there and in rural areas meant mopping up the state.

Hillary Clinton won those counties in 2016, and that shocked a lot peopleat least people who havent ventured outside of the I-285 perimeter in a good long while. Stacey Abrams carried both in her race for governor, and those votes may spell the difference between a narrow loss and a Thanksgiving run-off.  Part of the reason why McBath did so well is the strength of the Abrams machine. While McBath ran a strong campaign in her own right, its clear that having Abrams at the top of the ticket drove the energy necessary to put her over the top.

Abrams may not have won the governors race, but she was a major factor in the McBath win.

But given the fact that Clinton carried that part of the metro in 2016, it was probably a bad idea for Handel to attempt to use the former Democratic nominee as an albatross. It was a mistake, just as was trotting out Michael Bloombergs name. The former New York mayor isnt exactly a boogeyman in the north metro-- the largest concentration of wealth in the state. Handel seemed to think she was running in deep red, rural Georgia and not the decidedly more affluent, better educated 6 th district.

Then too, there was something telling about Handel skipping out on a chance to campaign with Donald Trump. He isnt exactly a fan favorite in the north metro, where college degrees and six and seven-figure mortgages are not uncommon. In those well-manicured subdivisions, our nations Blowhard-in-Chief would have a difficult time filling up a high school auditorium. Theres a reason the president went instead to Macon, Georgia, about 80 miles southeast of Atlanta, where thousands showed up to greet him.

In the final analysis, Handel had to know that she was always on borrowed time given the way the district is reshaping itself. Many thought Republicans could hold the 6 th for at least one or two more cycles. Her loss nowand the potential for a statewide runoff between a white man and a black woman in the governors race-- is confirmation about who we are becoming in Georgia.

If there is a lesson today for Republicans, it is this: You cannot draw your way out of every dilemma.

UPDATE: Handel beat Ossoff in last spring's special election 51.9 to 48.1 percent."
2018-10-11,Daily Beast,Cops Left Her Sister to Drown in a Sheriffs Van During a Hurricane Now She Wants Them Jailed,"For the past month, every second Donnela Jewels Green-Johnson has gone without answers about her sisters death has been a second too long.

Nicolette Green, 43, was one of two female mental-health patients who drowned last month while being transported to higher ground in a sheriffs van. The vehicle was swept away by the rising floodwaters of the Pee Dee River in the wake of Hurricane Florence. The two deputies in chargeStephen Flood and Joshua Bishopsafely escaped the submerged van. But Green and fellow patient Wendy Newton, 45, died inside the van.

Newtons family declined to comment on the record for this story.

After learning of her sisters death via breaking news on TV, Green-Johnson has made repeated attempts to contact authorities to demand answers about why her sister, who was 15 months older than her, was left to die.

But the mother of four has only been met with silence, she saideither repeatedly put on hold or never receiving a call back.

These people need to be held accountable and it falls on more than just the two deputies, she told The Daily Beast.

They act like Im some demon because I am wanting answers. Thats not fair. They demand answers of civilians all the time and we have to be forthcoming immediately, the middle school teacher added. They dont want to be held accountable. We absolutely want criminal charges brought against both men.

Immediately following the womens deaths, three law-enforcement agencies launched investigations into what Horry County Sheriff Phillip Thompson deemed a tragic accident. Flood and Bishop were placed on paid administrative leave.

The sheriffs office spokeswoman, Brooke Holden, confirmed to The Daily Beast on Tuesday that the two men are still on paid leave as the investigation continues.

When asked for an update on the internal investigation, however, Holden referred all inquiries to the State Law Enforcement Division due to a pending investigation, adding that Horry County Sheriff's Department has complete trust and confidence in their probe.

But for Green-Johnson and her family, the lack of any immediate consequences for the deputies is a slap in the face for the victims families and friends, [protecting] their men at the cost of their honor and integrity.

She surmised that if she had driven into flood waters while responsible for two passengers, she would already be in handcuffs.We are fighting the good old boy system here, she railed. It is obvious manslaughter, reckless endangerment with gross negligence. Whether or not they press charges, who knows?

While an investigation will surely look into whether the deputies should be held criminally liable for Greens and Newtons deaths, Green-Johnson believes authorities are stalling to hold the men accountable, despite some details suggesting poor judgment.

The Pee Dee River was considered a  major flood river and had been closely monitored by officials after Florence, Horry County Sheriffs Office spokeswoman Brooke Holden told The Daily Beast last month. Despite that, the deputies chose to drive around a road barricade, where they encountered the rivers flood waters, pinning their van against a guardrail.

The water is deep, fast, and contaminated, Marion County Coroner Jerry Richardson told The Daily Beast at the time. They were trying to negotiate with it and it just didnt work out.

Making matters worse, Green and Newton were restrained in the back cage at the time, making it impossible for the deputies to get to them through a padlocked door separating the front seats from the holding area.

Horry County authorities confirmed to the The Daily Beast that the standard police-issued Ford van used to transport the two mental-health patients had only two exit points: the front side doors and a set of double doors on the back of the vehicle, which was padlocked. The van also contained a video-recording device that was retrieved by state investigators.

My understanding is that they didnt have a key to the lock and the side exit was unavailable to the women because it was blocked by either guardrail or pressure from the water, said Scott Bellamy, the Green familys attorney.

The two women drowned while the deputies climbed atop the submerged van to wait for rescue teams from Marion and Horry counties to arrive, after which they were transported to a nearby hospital.

The fate of the two deputies depends on the South Carolina Law Enforcement Divisions inquiry, spokesman Thom Berry told The Daily Beast, adding that no further comment can be made while the investigation is ongoing.

Initially, the quick action of state agencies proved promising to the grieving families, and Sheriff Thompson said in a statement the day after the drowning that his department was working hand-in-hand... to cooperate in this investigation. Two additional investigations, including a traffic investigation and an internal investigation, are taking place.

But since then, the grieving families say theyve been met with silence.

I had to call and leave messages a week after the incident occurred, an exasperated Green-Johnson explained. I had to reach out to them! Since then, when I questioned their professionalism and their lack of compassion for the victims families, now the [state] investigator wont return my phone calls... He is either scared of me or has absolutely no professionalism.

The family has anxiety that the investigation will not be full and complete, and while I dont believe any agency has any reason not to be complete, I am trying to gather all information for the family, Bellamy, the family attorney, added.

The Greens have also grown especially agitated by their inability to speak with the sheriff since meeting with him two days after Nicolettes death.

You sat across from me and my parents, in our lawyers office, and you expressed your condolences.  Like idiotslike grieving, naive idiotswe believed you, Green-Johnson told The Daily Beast she wishes she could now tell Thompson.

She continued: We clung to the old-fashioned idea that right was right, wrong was wrong, and that when a man gave his word it meant something. You promised that justice would be served and you promised that Horry County and your department would do right by the victims. Sir, you have not kept your word.

The lack of communication prompted Green and her family to reach out to state politicians, where they were met with similar silence.

Politicians in the state wont answer my phone calls, emails, nothing. They wont get back to me. Elections are coming up and they dont want to be associated with a polarizing issue like this, Green-Johnson said, adding that Republican Sen. Tim Scotts office finally returned her call Wednesday to say they will demand an investigation timeline. It has a lot of uh-ohs attached to it, especially for a Republican state. They dont want to piss off their Republican constituents by being seen as antagonizing law-enforcement officials.

The scene of the incident is still blocked off in Marion County, as large portions of the road have been washed away by the floods. Theres a makeshift memorial placed by the Green family near the site, on the side of Highway 76: A wreath, pink and white flowers, and a cross with the names Nikki and Wendy painted above.

The sheriffs van is no longer there, as it was extricated from the waters and investigated five days after the incident. But before it was towed from the scene, the Green familys lawyer discovered that investigators left behind Nicolette Greens baseball cap on the floor of the cage where she died.

Authorities said they did not view the hat as necessary for their investigation and so they left it in the van. But for Green-Johnson, its symbolic of how she feels officials have treated the victims and their families.

It was just carelessly left on the van floor, like trash. Which is how they treated my sister and Wendy, she said."
2018-07-15,Daily Beast,Dennis Rodman Bombs Harder Than Ann Coulter at Bruce Willis Roast,"HOLLYWOOD, California  What on Earth was Dennis Rodman thinking?

On Saturday night at the Hollywood Palladium, the man who helped bring Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un together became the latest in a long line of punching bags at The Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis. Willis may have been in the hot seat, but Rodmana last-minute addition to the daistook a lot of the heat.

Like Mike The Situation Sorrentino and Ann Coulter before him, Rodman was the latest non-comedian to experience what its like to not only bomb on a big stage but then get utterly destroyed by pros like Roastmaster General Jeff Ross, seasoned stand-ups Nikki Glaser and Lil Rel Howery and wildcards like perennial favorite Martha Stewart.

The nights roastmaster Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who played a younger version of Willis in Looper, got things started when he introduced peacemaker Rodman at the top of the show. Dennis may be the only person on the planet who can prevent a nuclear war, he remarked. So I guess this is goodbye.

Dennis is the only person who can wear a MAGA hat and have it be the least upsetting part of his wardrobe, Glaser joked during her hilarious set, adding that its fun to meet someone with whatever illness Roseanne has but in a giant black man.

When I look at Dennis, I immediately think of the N-word: nuclear war, Martha Stewart said when she took the podium. She went on to say that had someone told her in the 90s that in 2018 Rodman would be Americas last best hope to prevent nuclear war between the U.S. and North Korea, she would have said, Dennis Rodman is alive in 2018?

When the NBA champion finally took the podium near the end of the show, things got off to a rough start when he was apparently too tall for the mica stage manager had lower it and ask him to start over. He began by commenting on all the jokes throughout the night about who was the worst actor on the stage. You all are, he said. That was the punchline.

Rodman told Martha Stewart that the next time she goes to prison, she should call him. I will secure your release. Get it? Because he sort of helped get American detainees released from North Korea. Im fucking drunk, he added, out of nowhere, at one point.

Every time he failed to get a laugh for a joke, he would chuckle to himself and say, OK, on with the show. When he had to repeat a joke for the third time, he reminded the audience that hes never done this kind of thing before, saying, Let me get through this. It wasnt easy.

And then there was this joke directed at Willis, probably his best of the night: You keep making these bomb movies. But guess what? So does Kim Jong Un. But at least Kim is smart enough not to release his. Unfortunately, it seems as though Rodman was not smart enough to hire a competent comedian to write jokes for him.

Give it up for our next secretary of state, Dennis Rodman! Jeff Ross, who walked the red carpet as Kim Jong Un flanked by sexy female guards, said, following the man he referred to as Kim Jong Unintelligible. Marveling at the bizarre relationship between the two men, he added, You think Kim Jong Un is a nice guy and he thinks youre Scottie Pippen.

Of course, most of the nights jokes were directed at Willis. When I spoke to Ross at Comedy Centrals Clusterfest in San Francisco last month, he said that Willis told him I just want you to know, and tell everyone else, not to hold back. I want you guys to throw rocks, because Im going to throw them right back.

I was so moved by that, Ross added at the time. Because most people go into these roasts nervous. We live in such a touchy society right now and heres a guy going, Bring it.

Bruce Willis isnt exactly known for his smile, but he appeared more than happy to laugh at himself throughout the roast. There were the expected bald jokes, but also a few more inspired bits about his checkered movie career, messy divorce from Demi Moore and the invention of Planet Hollywood.

You went from Hollywoods leading man to Demi Moore looking at you and going, Id rather fuck the dumb guy from Dude, Wheres My Car? Ross said of Willis. And then there was the inevitable too soon joke about Planet Hollywood: Anthony Bourdain ate there. He said it was the saddest moment of his life.

Though hes not known for comedy, one of the best performances of the night belonged to Edward Norton, who just directed Willis in the upcoming adaptation of Jonathan Lethems Motherless Brooklyn. Eschewing traditional jokes, Norton delivered a brilliant speech about how he should have focused on becoming a global dickhead powerhouse movie star like Willis instead of chasing things like Oscar nominations and respect that brought down the house.

But that was before Norton was one-upped by the nights big surprise guest, Demi Moore, who showed up to roast her ex-husband to his face with their three amazing, beautiful children in the audience. Four if you count Bruce, she quipped.

Bruce said the end of our marriage was his biggest failure. Dont be so hard on yourself, youve had plenty of failures, Moore joked, adding that their marriage was like The Sixth Sense: you were dead the whole time.

The evening ended, as it always does, with a set from the man of the hour. Buckle up, bitches, this is ass-whooping time! he began, before firing back at his roasters and calling it a night."
2018-10-15,Daily Beast,Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Expecting First Child,"Meghan Markle is pregnant and will be having a baby in the spring, Buckingham Palace announced today, hours after the couple touched down in Australia for their first extended foreign royal tour.

The couple have 76 public engagements over the next 16 days.

There was intense speculation that Meghan was pregnant this weekend after she arrived at the wedding of Princess Eugenie on Friday wearing an oversize blue coat, and the suspicion was heightened when she disembarked from a plane in Sydney last night holding two plastic folders in front of her stomach.

Later this week, Meghan is due to visit Fiji and Tonga, despite health organizations warning that the Zika virus is present and active there.

The palace said that Meghan had received medical advice and the trip was going ahead as planned.

The palace said, Their Royal Highnesses are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in Spring 2019.

Their Royal Highnesses very much appreciate all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share their happy news.

The palace also revealed that the news was circulated among senior family members ahead of Princess Eugenies wedding Friday.

The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted for the couple and were able to congratulate them on Friday at the wedding in person, said the statement.

The revelation that family members were told at or before the wedding is unlikely to please the Yorks, who wanted the focus to be exclusively on Eugenie.

This morning, Sarah Ferguson, Eugenie's mother, sent out a volley of tweets recapping the events of the wedding without offering a congratulatory message to Meghan and Harry.

It also made sense of a rare sight: the queen's famously abrupt daughter Princess Anne smiling broadly as she talked animatedly to a grinning Meghan before the service started.

Meghans mother was mentioned in the official statement but there was no reference to her father, whom Meghan has cut out of her life since he betrayed the royal couple by giving a series of aggressive and highly critical interviews to global media after the wedding.

Ms. Doria Ragland is very happy about the lovely news and she looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild, the palace said.

Harry is 34 and Meghan turned 37 this summer.

At the time of his engagement, Harry said he and Meghan planned to start a family in the near future and he has made no secret of his desire to have kids over the years.

Meghans pregnancy appears to have been trouble-free so far, in contrast to Kate Middleton, who suffered with extreme morning sickness, and given that the palace said the baby is due in the spring, it seems reasonable to assume that Meghan is safely past the 12-week point.

So a new royal baby in April seems the likeliest bet now."
2018-10-01,Daily Beast,Fox News Fired Him for Calling Kavanaugh Accusers Skanks Now Hes Airing the Networks Gossip,"After an unhinged Twitter tirade last Thursday, in which Fox News contributor Kevin Jackson called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaughs sexual-assault accusers lying skanks, the right-wing network fired him almost immediately.

Kevin Jackson has been terminated as a contributor, a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. His comments on todays hearings were reprehensible and do not reflect the values of Fox News.

Just a few days later, Jackson re-emerged on Monday, sitting down with fellow pro-Trump radio host Joe Piscopo, and hitting back against his former employer.

Fox is dumb, Jackson said in the radio interview, first spotted by Mediaite. Jackson had frequently appeared on the network over the past several years, largely providing his pro-Trump commentary and occasionally co-hosting talk shows like Outnumbered.

Ill just give you some inside baseball, Jackson told Piscopo. I could have said something to save my job. Fox was like Yeah you want to say this or do that? Hell no!

He further lamented: I could still have a job at Fox, if I wanted to say the right thing.

Jackson said he felt compelled to fire off the sexist tweets last Thursday after the nonsense he witnessed during Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Fords testimony before the Senate judiciary committee.

Lying skanks are what these 3 women are, and we ALL know more, Jackson wrote in one of those Thursday tweets, adding that leftist women are skanky for the most part.

He called out Ford specifically in another, declaring that the academic problems she said stemmed from the alleged sexual assault were just the result of her PROMISCUITY!

Dang girl, stop opening your legs and OPEN A BOOK! the conservative firebrand tweeted.

There is not a conservative woman I know who would accuse a man of doing what Kavanaugh did they say this womanthis verminis doing, Jackson angrily told Piscopo, defending the tweets that got him fired.

So I called her what she is.

After Piscopo asked Jackson whether Fox News was simply afraid to give him his own show because he is an edgy black man, the ex-Fox contributor ranted against what he views as the networks hypocrisy in firing him for reprehensible words.

Ed Henry was hanging out with strippers while he was married, Jackson said about the former networks chief White House correspondent who took a leave of absence and a demotion after it was revealed in 2016 that he had an extramarital affair with a Las Vegas cocktail waitress.(Jackson also falsely claimed Henry had his own show on the network. He did not.)

Jackson additionally singled out Fox News host Jesse Watters, whose wife filed for divorce earlier this year amid reports that the conservative host, beloved by President Trump, had an affair with a colleague. Watters currently co-hosts The Five along with his own weekend show, titled Watters World.

Jesse Watters, who just recently divorced his wife, or is in the process, and hes hanging out with some young chick that he did, Jackson said.

If thats what Fox decides they want to have on, congratulations to them."
2018-02-28,Daily Beast,Its Time for E to Pull Ryan Seacrest From the Oscars Red Carpet,"The Oscars red carpet, once arguably the slightest and most inane part of awards season, has suddenly become the most dramatic.

When Variety published a story Monday detailing an ex-stylists claims that Ryan Seacrest allegedly abused her, one of the immediate reactionsoutside of horror, disgust, frustration, and, yes, even tinges of skepticismwas how this would affect Seacrests status as the most high profile stop on the Oscars red carpet.

According to Suzie Hardy, Seacrests former stylist, the TV personality and media mogul subjected her to years of sexual abuse and harassment, including grinding his erect penis against her while clad only in his underwear, groping her vagina, and at one point slapping her buttock so hard that it left a large welt still visible hours later. Seacrest denied the allegations, his lawyer alleged that Hardy was extorting him, and E! released a statement saying it launched an investigation into Hardys claims and found insufficient evidence to confirm them.

E! confirmed Tuesday that Seacrest would still host the networks red carpet pre-show on Sunday.

Barely 12 hours later, another former co-worker of Hardys told NBC News that he witnessed Seacrests alleged harassment: She would go to tie his shoe and Ryan would shove her head toward his crotch. I saw that more than once.

More, Page Six is reporting that publicists are encouraging their clients to avoid Seacrest entirely on the red carpet, should he remain E!s host. Which he shouldnt. Its time to fire Ryan Seacrest from the Oscars red carpet.

Without making any ruling on the veracity of either partys claimswe couldnt presume to do sohaving Seacrest on the red carpet Sunday night is a misjudgment that does far worse than tee up a PR catastrophe for the E! network. It is an act of tone-deafness that doubles as an act of aggression on the women and stars who are put in the awkward and unfair position of weighing whether to make a political statement, or even judgement of guilt, by snubbing Seacrest.

The optics of him keeping his position is borderline insane.

Sundays ceremony comes at the end of an award season defined by the #MeToo movement and Times Up campaign. The resounding message has been that enough is enough when it comes to the lack of consequences for the predatory behavior and sexual misconduct of Hollywoods power players. It also has very much been about ending the kind of power dynamic that forces women into compromising positions, otherwise risking professional repercussions.

There is such inherent hypocrisy, after championing the message these women have been preaching these last months, to force them directly into one such compromising position: confront the accusations against one of Hollywoods most powerful and influential men, or (and again without ruling on his guilt) seem to dismiss or condone the allegations by being interviewed by him.

Weve already witnessed just how impossible all this for the celebrities.

Scandal star Bellamy Young was asked a leading question Monday night at the premiere of A Wrinkle in Time about whether Seacrest should step aside from the red carpet in the wake of the allegations against him. She said yes, in a perfectly reasoned, perfectly woke answer: I think this is the time to step aside and let someone of equal talent that is beyond reproach to be in charge.

Its unclear if by her own volition, or under pressure from concerned flacks worried that she may have put herself in poor favor with those in Seacrests large orbit, but Young issued an apology the next day. I apologize to Ryan Seacrest. He has been exonerated from the allegations I was told about on the carpet, so my opinion is different now, she said in a statement.

Suddenly someone elses scandal became her own, which has been the case time and again over these last months as we have put these actors on the spot to speak for, against, on behalf of, or in condemnation of a spectrum of Bad Mens bad behavior. The sound bite becomes the headline that births the think piece. And all after a 30-second exchange an actor had with an interviewer on a red carpet.

This may be a slight tangent, but Allison Janney and Anna Faris made a great point about this during a bit on Faris Unqualified podcast this week, on which Janney was a guest. They mocked the high-pressure, wildly unpredictable nature of red carpet interviews during a role-playing exercise in which Faris played an entertainment journalist grilling Janney on everything from who she was wearing, what research she did on her character, whether shes been sexually harassed, and if she thinks there was collusion with Russia.

The lunacy of the breadth of questions was the point of the comedy bit, but there was a harsh truth to all of it. Especially now, weve set up these gotcha traps for these actors to talk their ways into. On the one hand, its wonderful that red carpet has taken on weightier subject matter this year. But it was inevitable that the evolution would be problematic as well.

Seacrest, ironically, has always been the best of the myriad red carpet hosts in balancing the frivolity of the fashion and pageantry with more meaningful questions. At least he was the interviewer least likely to induce whiplash when following up questions about mani-pedis with what it means to be a woman at this time in our country.

And, along with his power, he has many, many friends in the industry. People really like the guy. Maybe thats exactly what E! is banking on, that his wide net of friends wouldnt embarrass him on Sunday by slighting him. But as the showing of support for Catt Sadler at the Golden Globes proved, that might not be the best gamble for the network to make.

E! is part of the NBC Universal umbrella of networks. It is the same umbrella of networks that wouldnt run Ronan Farrows Harvey Weinstein investigation, sending him to The New Yorker. That sat on the notorious Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape. That fostered an unsafe working environment in order to placate Matt Lauer.

Maybe for once it could get things right."
2018-09-01,Daily Beast,With McCain Funeral Underway Trump Tweets About Fox and Friends and Heads to a Golf Club,"As Republicans and Democrats prepared for Sen. John McCains funeral service at Washington National Cathedral Saturday morning, Donald Trump sequestered himself in the White House, tweeting lines from a recent Fox & Friends episode, quoting one of his favorite commentators, Dan Bongino.

You have a Fake Dossier, gathered by Steele, paid by the Clinton team to get information on Trump, the president posted, quoting from Bonginos Fox hit. The Dossier is Fake, nothing in it has been verified. It then filters into our American court system in order to spy on Barrack Obama and Hillary Clintons political opponent...Trump, and now we find out that there wasnt even a hearingthat Donald Trumps 4th Amendment right to privacy was signed away...and someone in there is swearing that this stuff is true, when it wasnt? This is the scandal herea police state.

Trump misspelled Obamas first name, but did not misspell Dan Bongino whon the president specifically namechecked and credited in a second tweet.

There were other posts from President Trump on Saturday morning. He vented about how there is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal. He quoted lawyer Alan Dershowitzs media criticism. He referenced Judicial Watchs Tom Fitton and blasted the supposed anti-Trump corruption enabled by the leadership at the Deep State rogues gallery of the FBI and Department of Justice.

Shortly after the flurry of Twitter missives, the president settled into his private golf club in Virginia, just as the speeches at McCains DC funeral were already underway. It was a funeral that the McCain family had all but banned the sitting president from attending.

And yet Trumps presence still loomed at Washington National Cathedral, where at least two of the eulogies appeared to take digs at Trumpism, if not at Trump himself.

McCain was a critic of Trump and his behavior, and the 45th president of the United States hated the late senator enough that even after news of his death broke, Trump did what he could not to perfunctorily honor McCain.

The death of her father, Meghan McCain said at the ceremony, represented the loss of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.

The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great, she said, to a burst of applause, in what appeared to be a clear dig at Trumps campaign slogan, Make America Great Again.

For his part, Trumps predecessor and the man who beat McCain in the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama, used part of his eulogy to denounce a style of American politics of which he certainly views Trumpism a part. Obama knocked those who engage in bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage, and described a politics that pretends to be brave and tough but in fact is born of fear.

There were other swipes that appeared to be thinly veiled comments on Trump and the news of the day, some of which came from the heart of Trumpworld.

[email protected] ran for @POTUS ONE time and WON! Some people will never recover from that. #SorryNotSorry Yes,  #MAGA, Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser on the Trump re-election campaign, tweeted on Saturday morning, affixing an American flag emoji to the end of her post.

As of the early afternoon, Trump himself had yet to publicly weigh in on the service or the late GOP senator this weekend. For his aides, that is probably for the best. Earlier this week, a senior West Wing official told The Daily Beast that as long as Trump didnt hate-tweet McCain or any of the funeral speakers directly on Saturday, theyd be satisfied."
2018-08-02,Daily Beast,QAnon the Pro-Trump Conspiracy Theory Now Believes JFK Jr Faked His Death to Become Its Leader,"Believers in the bizarre pro-Trump conspiracy theory called QAnon were out in force at the presidents rally in Tampa, Florida on Tuesday, waving signs and cut-outs of the letter Q in front of the television cameras.

The surprisingly large number of Trump supporters who believe in the off-the-wall conspiracy theory and the attendant media attention marks a new height of attention for QAnon, which grew from the internet swamps of 4Chan and 8Chan.

Its there, starting in October 2017, that an anonymous poster dubbed Q began leaving cryptic clues that Trump supporters used to construct an alternate interpretation of current events where Trump is constantly battling evil forces.

For QAnon believers, special counsel Robert Mueller isnt really investigating the Trump campaignhes actually working with Trump to take down a cabal of deep-state plotters and pedophiles. Soon, QAnon fans believe, Trump will team up with the military to throw top Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama into Guantanamo Bay.

But what QAnon believers actually believe in constantly changing. After taking advantage of the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich and promoting dangerous ideas like Pizzagate, QAnon supporters have found a new tragedy to exploit: the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., son of the late president.

Until July, QAnon supporters believed that Q, the anonymous online forum poster whose cryptic clues make up the conspiracy theory, was a high-ranking Trump administration official, or maybe even Trump himself. But now, a good portion of QAnon believers have become convinced that Q is none other than JFK Jr, even though he died in a plane crash nearly 20 years ago.

July was a rough month for QAnon followers. After making a post on July 4, Q didnt leave any clues for 20 days, marking the longest gap between Q hints since the scheme began in late October 2017. That left QAnon believers without much to do, leaving their imaginations to run even wilder than usual. It also meant that anyone who wanted to sway the often very gullible people who believe in QAnon had a chance to sway them in a new direction.

Around the middle of July, a new figure named R appeared in the 8Chan forum devoted to QAnon research. (R is the letter in the alphabet after Q.) The anonymous poster, who was soon dubbed Ranon, posited that Kennedy hadnt actually died in a plane crash off the coast of Massachusetts. Instead, hed faked his death to avoid the supposed deep-state cabal that is at the center of QAnon and teamed up with Trump to kick off a decades-long strategy. While Trump had laid the groundwork for his presidential bid, QAnon believers posited, Kennedy had become Q.

The idea that Kennedy and his wife were alive and living under pseudonyms added an unstable new element to a conspiracy theory that has already inspired an armed man to shut down a road near the Hoover Dam and encouraged QAnon believers to help fund a bizarre vigilante sex trafficking operation in Arizona.

YouTube videos about the new theory have garnered hundreds of thousands of views. On Reddit, QAnon supporters wondered about the portents behind Trump meeting Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, the anniversary of Kennedys death. One popular YouTube video claimed that QAnon had proven how JFK JR was revealed to be ALIVE. On 8Chan, believers launched a new board devoted to considering the theory that Kennedy was still alive. Amazon T-shirt vendors began selling shirts that said JFK Jr. = R.

Incredibly, QAnon believers claim Kennedy has even appeared in public at Trump rallies, posing as just another Trump. They latched onto a picture of a bearded, middle-aged man in glasses standing in the stands behind Trump at one rally, claiming that the man was actually Kennedy in disguise.

In fact, the man looks nothing like Kennedy. But QAnon supporters ran wild with the theory anyway, trying to use facial aging programs to prove that he was Kennedy, who would be 57 today.

JFK Jr was not a stupid man he KNEW what they did to his father, one well-received Reddit thread read, claiming that the man at the Trump rally was blatantly disguised.

QAnon believers began sifting through details of the mans life for proof that he was actually Kennedy. They looked at the people standing next to him at the rally, suspecting that another rally attendee was Kennedys wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, who was also killed in the crash. They analyzed the mans name for clues and saw one in footage of the man near a DoubleTree hotelas in body double.

In late July, whatever person or group is behind Q returned to posting and denounced R, its newfound rival for impressionable Trump supporters. Still, the Kennedy theory persists among a segment of QAnon believers. On Wednesday, a day after the Trump rally in Tampa, QAnon supporters online were once again analyzing pictures of rally attendees for proof that the Kennedys are still alive."
2018-02-25,Daily Beast,Teachers Belong in Classrooms Teaching,"My mother was a school teacher. Taught elementary school for more than three decades. Only thing she ever packed in her classroom was lunch for those kids too poor to afford one.

She was a devout Catholic, a widow, an independent woman who went back to school after my father died when my brothers and I were quite young. She understood loss, loneliness and love of family.

It occurred to me many times across the past few days that she would be both angry and amazed that many people including the preposterous president want to have teachers with guns in schools; emotion erasing common sense here.

A lot has been said and written about the issue of having teachers adept at using a gun trained and ready for the day when the next male mental case walks into Home Room or AP History with his brain on fire and his hands holding an AR-15. Of course the effort to encourage faculty firearms is led by President Bone-Spurs who is so quick to call others cowards and so ignorant to claim and believe that establishing schools as Gun Free Zones makes them magnets for massacres.

Does anyone believe, actually believe, that those whose minds have been destroyed by disease, despair, anger, illogic, insanity would have turned from the door at Columbine, at Sandy Hook? At Virginia Tech? Stoneman Douglas High? because they thought their English teacher or lacrosse coach kept a Glock in the cabinet?

This is a young madman at the door. Not a thinking, rational person.

And here is your designated teacher suddenly alerted to a shooting siege that is already underway. Here we go, armed and ready, safety off, out in a hallway filled with students screaming, running toward some sort of seclusion and safety.

The designated faculty defender has a pistol, not an assault rifle. The teacher is well trained. The teacher has spent hours at the range becoming intimately familiar, adept, with the weapon. After so much range time the teacher is an expert marksman. Can shoot the eyes out of a paper target, over and over.

Then, there in the hallway, comes the shooter. In the swiftest second the teacher has ever known multiple things pass through the teachers mind faster than light: the shooter has an assault weapon. The shooter is young.The shooter, Oh My God, is a former student. And the shooter is an actual human being. No paper target here. A person. A kid whose name the teacher almost recalls. The teacher, like almost everyone around us, has never killed another human being.

And in that single split second of hesitation, while all those emotions and reactions whirl through this one normal persons mind the teacher is shot dead by that crazy person in the corridor who is not thinking at all and does not hesitate. The crazy person, the kid with the assault weapon, showed up with a mad purpose and is there doing what he is doing because his demons told him to kill.

Teachers belong in classrooms, teaching. Not in coffins, another casualty of a political culture and a Congress so lacking in courage and character that it continues to bury common sense each and every day, living with more fear of losing an election than any fear of losing another student or now perhaps a school teacher thought to be adept with a gun."
2018-11-25,Daily Beast,The New York City Private Mansion with the Citys Best Mirrored Gold Room,"The Payne Whitney Mansion on Manhattans Upper East Side is a case study in insecurity.

Some buildings and engineering marvels sum up the age in which they were built: The Golden Gate Bridge and Rockefeller Center tell you all you need to know about vaulting mid-century American ambition. Likewise, New York Citys Payne Whitney Mansion, staring across 5th Avenue at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, also defines a period of American history: that long moment between the Civil War and World War I when rich Americans fretted about their perceived lack of cultural identity and sophistication.

Built during the Gilded Age, the 5th Avenue marble mansions along Museum Mile on the Upper East Side were inhabited by the 1 percent of the 1 percent. Because castles and palaces are scarce in this country, the elite did what wealthy Americans always do: built brand new mansions and stocked them with paintings, sculpture, lyres, music stands, tapestries, and all sorts and styles of uncomfortable furniture from France and Italy. They were not discriminatingit just had to be old. A marble statue of a little archer was housed in the Payne Whitney house for decades before someone figured out that it was a genuine Michelangelo.

For the rich, it was not enough to be the kings and queens of industry. They wanted to be seen as such. How else do we explain something like the Venetian Room in the Payne Whitney House? Designed by the Gilded Ages favorite architect and decorator, Stanford White, who also designed the mansion that contains it, the Venetian Room looks like Midas just walked through: mirrors and marble and porcelain from floor to ceiling, nearly all of it framed in gold or coated in gold leaf. It looks like a mini-mint, and its message is unmistakable: only people with more money than they know what to do with possess such an extravagant room.

Bought by France in 1952, the Payne Whitney mansion now houses the cultural services center of the French Embassy. While it regularly hosts lectures, films, performances, exhibits, and perhaps even your wedding reception, its not usually open for tours (the top floors, now mostly office space, are closed to the public). But even though only a few rooms have been fully restored to their original opulence, the house is very much worth a look, for the surprises uncovered during renovations and for some uniquely American touches. So if you get a chance to go, pounce.

I got in during Open House New York, the once-a-year chance to marvel at New York City architectural gems that are off limits, partially or entirely, for the rest of the year. An annual event since 2001, OHNY is a fantastic opportunity to explore art and architectural interests that are not listed in tourist itineraries and may not even be known or frequented by natives. This years city-wide open house took place October 12-14, so that ship has sailed. But mark your calendar for next year. Fall is a beautiful time for walking tours.

In 1902, Oliver Payne commissioned White to build the Beaux Arts mansion as a wedding gift for his nephew, Payne Whitney, and his new bride, Helen Hay. Approaching the five-story building today, one can see that the exterior takes its inspiration from 16th-century Italian architecture. The Italian Renaissance influence continues into the marble lobby, at least as long as the eye is trained toward the center of the room, at that little boy carved by Michelangelo that tops a small fountain (full disclosure: this statue is a copythe original is now housed across the street at the Met). Glance at the room surrounding him, though, and its clearculturally, artistically, estheticallythe Payne Whitney mansion is an American mess. But beautiful.

Originally the house stood alone on a plot of land in the newly developing Upper East Side overlooking Central Park, which is why it boasts grand windows that allow light to fill the rooms, a rarity in New York City then and now. The structure simply wasnt hemmed in by neighbors. And, with the city expanding, architects were exploring newer ways to convey wealth.

For the Whitneys, White pulled out all the Beaux Arts stops. The house and decoration that resulted is busy as hell, with all the styles (Roman, Greek, Italianate, French neoclassical) vying for dominance in an uneasy balancing act. The architect was an artist at heart, but he was businessman enough to please his clients. His genius lay in applying both impulses to every detail. Before selecting the marble for the mansion, for example, White asked Oliver Payne what kind of marble was used in his childhood home, so White could connect the house not only to European aristocracy but also to family history.

The interior takes its cues from the Italian Renaissance. The details throughoutthe capitals that top the columns, the molding, and trelliseswere repeated throughout to give a sense of continuity and unity from room to room. White introduces these architectural elements in the immense marble foyer, where the boy stands inside a rotunda beneath a domed ceiling, or the illusion of a dome achieved with painted lattice crosses and overlapping green leaves that frame eight medallion paintings depicting children playing along the border. Like the Michelangelo sculpture, the painting, which had been covered with 70 years of dirt and soot, was an unexpected treasure revealed when the foyer was restored in 1987.

The room isnt entirely faithful to the 16th century, and White used the 16 columns surrounding the dome as an enclosure to separate the receiving area from the narrow hall that leads to the rest of the house. Whites use of classical and Renaissance principles serve the purposes of privacy.

The Venetian Room, a parlor just off the main entrance hall, is a shift in style with its mirrored walls and gold accents, and might just be the most literal representation of the Gilded Age in New York City. Completed in 1906 just before White was murdered, the Venetian Room was his last contribution to the mansion, and, for that matter, his last professional creation. The lattice from the rotunda painting is echoed in the metal cornice with pastel porcelain flowers twining through it in the Venetian Room. Despite its name, the room looks like a miniature of Versailles Hall of Mirrors and evokes several centuries of French style. Its furnishings are a simulacrum of the aristocracy Americans were appropriating, and not without a little confusion. The clock on the mantelpiece dates from the era of Louis XIV, our guide said, or Louis XV. The furniture is 18th century French. Portraits from France and Italy from the 18th and 19th century bedeck the walls.

The Venetian Room was Helen Hay Whitneys favorite room in the house where she lived from her wedding to her death in 1947. She loved the room so much that before she died she had it disassembled and stored to protect it. In 1997, it was reassembled and given to the French embassy, which had it reinstalled in its original home. The most recent restoration was completed this year, although unfortunately the original ceiling wasnt salvageable. Its now painted a neutral dove gray with faint clouds that are mostly indecipherable but do not detract from the magnificence of the assemblage.

Another gem revealed by the restoration process is a stained-glass window designed by New York-based John La Farge, one of the preeminent American designers of stained-glass of the late 19th century. For decades, the window, entitled Autumn, was hiddenand forgottenbehind a wall between the second and third floors (the exterior window remains bricked in, so no light passes through the glass). La Farge used opalescent glass, which contains an iridescent mineral that creates its milky texture, as well as double layers of glass to create subtle shades.

Our guide stopped at Autumn and gave some insight into why he believes it hangs where it does: This is an interesting point of contact between Stanford White and Helen Hay in that its almost an artifact of both their rejected artistic ambitions. Stanford White, as a child, wanted to become an artist. He tells his father. His father is terrified, and says, Go talk to John La Farge. John La Farge tells Stanford White, I know you want to be an artist, but theres no money in it. Nobodys going to appreciate the arts in America. You should be an architect instead. As for Helen Hay, you cant read it but the inscription at the bottom [on the plaque beneath the stained glass window] is from one of her poems. Before she got married, Helen Hay was very interested in being a poet, had several works published, which her father then promptly seized and had destroyed, because this wasnt an acceptable thing to do. So I like to think of this window as a place where Stanford White is almost commiserating with Helen Hay to a certain degree.

Interestingly, John La Farge, the artist, was aware of Americas insecurity about its identity. You can hear it in that advice he gave Stanford White. He knew that all the indigenous art that Americans could wantand celebrate as a culture unique to itselfisnt good enough. There is still something within themselves that Americans deem provincial and unrefined, and so they embrace the history in which they play no part, because royalty is still the highest form of stature in life and its a concept not easily shed.

The last of the excavated treasures is also unequivocally American: a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe that was found in a wooden crate sitting in one of the storage rooms at the mansion. How it got there nobody knows, but we do know she wore it, because a writer researching a book on Monroes life discovered photographs of her in the dress. According to our guide, the labels on the crate indicate that the dress was a direct shipment from France to America, to the French Embassy. Some people think there might have been an exhibit in Paris, some sort of Hollywood memorabilia, and it just kind of ended up here and disappeared. And then, theres also this crate, which its paired with that says, Milton Greene. Milton Greene was one of the eminent photographers of Marilyn Monroes time. As for as how it all actually ended up herewere still unsure.

One of the public spaces in the mansion that you can visit at any timeand one of the best parts of the building, for my moneyis the Albertine Bookstore, which opened in 2014 and occupies part of the first and second floors. It is, according to the Albertine website, the only bookshop in New York devoted solely to books in French and English with more than 14,000 contemporary and classic titles from 30 French-speaking countries.

Albertine, named for a character in Prousts In Search of Lost Time, was designed by Jacques Garciaknown locally for the NoMad Hotel in Manhattan. He created the stores rich, inviting interior with its wooden bookshelves, chandeliers, and sconces. The ceiling on the second floor is hand painted a beautiful, almost Atlantic blue with gold details that arabesque along the outer edges of the ceiling to become more concentrated and dynamic as they form a lyrical zodiac swirl that is consumed by a central sun. Its a modern adaptation of Franz Von Stucks music room at the Villa Stuck in Munich. Because it is technically part of the embassy, the Albertine is not just culturally but literally part of France and therefore complies with the French law that book prices cannot be reduced by more than 5 percent. Fixed book prices protect a rich network of publishers and booksellers in France and nourish its biblio-diversity. The French are just more civilized when it comes to art and culture, and the spirit of supporting it."
2018-06-19,Daily Beast,The Must-See Othello at Shakespeare in the Park Racism and Power in Pass Over,"Whether the performance is or isnt great, just being at Free Shakespeare in the Park, as produced every summer by New Yorks Public Theater, is a particularly sweet bit of New York magic. This time last year, it was also a fire conductor of absurd controversy, as the right wing leapt frothingly on a performance of Julius Caesar, featuring a Trumpified central character.

In the first of this summers productions, Othello, directed beautifully by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, there is no overt flirtation with present-day politics. Yet every Public production at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park opens with a now-familiar statement of inclusion and principle delivered via the speakers by the theater's artistic director Oskar Eustis. Free Shakespeare in the Park is an exercise in cultural as well as artistic aspiration.

So, whatever anyone writes, go if you havent done it before. A wonderful performance at the Delacorte enhances, and is enhanced by, the surroundings; the same surroundings can supply a useful diversion from a sub-par one.

Watching a play in the open air, surrounded by the trees and shadow of the trees, early evening sunshine fading to inky night, is its own best, intensifying effect.

The most recent Othello in New York before this was Sam Golds turbo-macho production at the New York Theatre Workshop in late 2016, starring David Oyelowo as noble and too-easily gulled Othello and Daniel Craig as the scheming Iago, wrecking lives and love, with verbal poison deposited in multiple ears.

If that production, in tight combat fatigues, felt modern and claustrophobically intense, Santiago-Hudsons, in traditional costume toughed-up with modern, tight leathers, takes full advantage of the Delacortes wide and open stage, well furnished by Rachel Haucks simple design of movable arches, with a lofty tower and levitating bed.

Othello remains a fascinating play, because the most complex character is not its title character, but his nemesis, Iago.

Chukwudi Iwuji plays Othello with a gravelly command that is its own rejoinder to the racism over his being a Moor, which is so virulently expressed to his face and behind his back. The play's first puzzle is that his loyalty to his beloved Desdemona (Heather Lind) leaks away far quicker than the depth of his professed love would suggest.

While we may not understand the suddenness of his fury (and his being fooled by a handkerchief), what we absolutely do understand is Iwuiji's rawly expressed, wounded betrayal, however misplaced it is.

The central couple, in this production anyway, are Iago (Corey Stoll) and his wife, Emilia (Alison Wright, giving the evening's most impressive performance as Desdemona's loyal maidservant). Stoll brings a balanced mix of wit and menace to one of theatre's greatest villains; lying to people's faces with ease, and telling us all about it. He does it, he sets out to destroy Othello, because he can and feels as if he should. We both laugh at his shameless manipulations, and are also revolted at the damage it causes.

Why Iago really does what he does is a teasing mystery (as his closing lines suggest, he'll never reveal all), but in Stoll's rich performance it seems to be about acquiring control rather than power. He delights in being an agent of chaos, and Stoll signals the extremity of his sociopathy in glancing moments of violence: a sudden verbal outburst, a frantic slapping of his own face.

Wright's commanding embodiment of Emiliawith the not-to-be-messed-with accent-edge of Wright's native North East Englandsignals that she knows her husband's capacity for villainy even before she has the full knowledge of it. Her final assertion of powerher insistence to speak and have her voice heard, to have the truth airedis as much an assertion of gender equality as it is the urgent and overdue application of truth.

Just as in the 2016 production, Emilia's devotion to Desdemonacrystallized in a conversation they have about women's place in a man's world, and a patriarchal definition of marriage, and in their final scene togetheris as forceful an expression of love as Othello expresses to Desdemona.

What this company does above all is make Othello the play understandable. Listen to Iwuji enunciate clearly what love means to Othello, and also what jealousy means to him. Listen to how Lind refuses to capitulate, as Desdemona, to the vilification suddenly foisted upon her. Even more minor characters like Roderigo (Motell Foster), and Cassio (Babak Tafti) make their characters understandable to us, and in return we become invested in them.

Othello may end in a galloping rush, but the clarity of this production, the interpretation and conveyance of Shakespeare's words to us, is a gift of both dramatic pleasure and comprehension, with flourishes such as Othello's murder of Desdemona, and scrapping and swordfights bought thrillingly to stage-filling life by Santiago-Hudson. Sure, the trees and darkness of Central Park are magical around you, but in this Othello there is enough magic on stage to command all your attention.

Othello is at the Delacorte Theater, NYC, until June 24. Details here.

It is rare for an audience to leave a play in total, presumably shocked silence; but such was the response of everyone attending a recent performance of the powerful Pass Over at the Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, which opens Monday night.

Antoinette Nwandu's play, imaginatively directed on an almost bare stage by Danya Taymor, seems, initially, to be about two close friends, Moses (John Michael Hill) and Kitch (Namir Smallwood). These two young black men in their early 20s are hanging on a street that is both their patch, but also their prison. They want something else from life. They're not sure what. They call each other the 'n' word freely, with affection and not-affection.

On Wilson Chin's sparse set, the most dominant piece of furnishing is a street light, which futters in and out of life. There's a small wire mesh cage to sit on, and a metallic stand.

But we are not just in a modern city. The program tells us that as well as a ghetto street, we should also imagine we are on a plantation in 1855, and Egypt, a civilization built by slaves, in the 13th century BCE. Nwandu's point is that racism has roots, long and unyielding. (A filmed version of the Steppenwolf production of the play, directed by Spike Lee and also starring Hill, is streaming on Amazon Prime.)

The play is at once very real, while also dwelling in a kind of magical, non-literal space, leaping across time and defying reality. When a police car approaches (unseen by us), Marcus Doshi's shafts of blue lighting suspend both Moses and Kitch in frozen fear.

The play's most mysterious figure is played by Gabriel Ebert, who serves on the LCT's artists' committee. The white Ebert is dressed in upper class-signaling flannels. Weirder, this blankly chilling guest is carrying a basket with food for a picnic with his grandmother. If he seems like Little Red Riding Hood, lost and from another time and possibly the world of fairytale and allegoryhis provisions include an (all-American) apple piethen he is also the Big Bad Wolf. (In the play's neatest optical illusion his picnic basket is bottomless.)

There is the bantering friendship-based humor between the excellent Hill and Smallwood, and also in the cultural disconnect and mistrust with the white interloper in their midst (they challenge Ebert to say the 'n' word), and cannot understand why he is there. But the laughter is uneasy: there is something utterly sinister about Ebert's character and his repetition of ""gee golly gosh."" Ebert also appears later as not just an abusive, racist policeman, but also a sexually abusive one.

Nwandu herself has said that the play is about ""two young black men deeply disenfranchised by society and community."" The inspiration for her writing it was the anger she felt over the death of Trayvon Martin and subsequent acquittal of George Zimmerman for his death. In her teaching career, she has come into contact with you young black and brown men who are victims of stop-and-frisk and ""constantly in peril of getting caught up in different systems.""

The play was an effort on her part to ""keep engaged in the American experiment as a citizen of this country who is feeling so angry and betrayed by what the country is."" Pass Over is intended to ask of its audiences, she said: ""Are we a nation that values young black men's lives? Who are we as a nation?""

The play does this extremely effectively, and offers no easy answers; indeed, only an incident that comes from another realsm offers Kitch the opportunity to exclaim delightedly: ""We've transcended race,"" near the end.

Nwandu covers so much in this lean, resonant 85-minute play: friendship, fear, racism, power, control, and a black powerlessness and sense of abuse that has soaked so much into the skins of Moses and Kitch they consider, a terrible way out. There is also, near the end, a transformative expression of black power.

But Pass Over isn't done; Nwandu has a far harsher, and deadlier, message to convey about white privilege and power, its exercise over centuries and maintenance into unseen futures. Confronted with that, and the play's damning, final words and horrible guttural sounds, is perhaps why a mostly white audience left the Claire Tow Theater in total silence.

Pass Over will run at Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center Theater, until July 15. Book here."

2018-03-21,Daily Beast,Joe Biden Id Have Beat the Hell Out of Trump in High School for Disrespecting Women,"Joe Biden appears to be itching for a fight with President Trump.

Appearing Tuesday evening at a University of Miami event, the former vice president declared that a younger version of himself would have had no problem resorting to fisticuffs to teach Trump a lesson about dignity.

When a guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it, Biden said during the anti-sexual assault It's On Us event. They asked me if Id like to debate this gentleman, and I said no. I said, If we were in high school, Id take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.

Biden, who is often discussed as a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, went on to refer to Trumps infamous locker-room talk excuse for his vulgar words about women.

Ive been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life, Biden said. Im a pretty damn good athlete.

He quipped: Any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest SOB in the room.

This is not the first time Biden has spoken about Trump in these particularly aggressive terms.

In October 2016, shortly after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape, the then-veep similarly said hed fight Trump if the two were classmates.

The press always asks me, dont I wish I were debating him?"" Biden said at a rally for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. No, I wish I were in high school. I could take him behind the gym. Thats what I wish.

And then, while addressing Trump bragging about nonconsensually groping women, Biden was even more repulsed.

What he said he did and does is the textbook definition of sexual assault, he said at the time. Think about this: it's more than wrong, he said because Im famous, because Im a star, because Im a billionaire, I can do things other people cant. What a disgusting assertion for anyone to make."
2018-05-22,Daily Beast,Vaping Killed Vapers Dont Care,"Vaping is having a rough couple of weeks.

Theres what appears to be the first death by vape, once considered the millennial response to cigarettes, the potential safe replacement to the oddly human oral fixation of sticking something that blazes fire on one end into ones mouth.

Firefighters responding to a fire earlier this month found 38-year-old Tallmadge DElia with severe injuries to his face. Officials believe the lithium battery, used to generate heat for the smoke thats emitted at the end of a vape, got so hot it exploded, causing the fire and killing DElia.

Then there was the case of an 18-year-old hostess at a rural Pennsylvania restaurant who decided to try using e-cigarettes, according to a case study in Pediatrics. Within three weeks, the woman developed a rather nasty conditionwet lungthat included coughing, labored breathing, and stabbing pains in her chest, eventually sending her into respiratory failure.

While the woman made a full recovery, it took only three weeks for her lungs to collapse, a side effect that doctors blamed squarely on vaping.

Both reports come on the heels of the Food and Drug Administration announcing that it was going to crack down on e-cigarettes and vaping, sending warning letters to companies that sell e-liquids that look variously like juice boxes, cookies, and candies. Companies selling these products have a responsibility to ensure they arent putting children in harms way or enticing youth use, and well continue to take action against those who sell tobacco products to youth and market products in this egregious fashion, Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, said in an accompanying statement.

But the sobering news stories will likely have little to no effect on vaping, often referred to as Juuling, for Juul, the brand name of the vape that leads the pack in both sales to adolescents looking to vape and social media influence.

Sherry Emery, the director of Health Media Collaboratory and a senior fellow in public health at the University of Chicago's NORC research center, has focused heavily on the vaping and smoking industries. She said upcoming research shes done on vaping advertising and teen usage from social media shows that these teens will look at negative news and just shrug, pull out their Juul, and inhale.

Emery acknowledged that the news that an exploding vape pen actually killed a person might give teens pause, mostly because its the first death by vape explosion and carries with it violent imagery. Theres also the immediacy of death, something most users dont associate with vaping, whose implicit watered down smoking brandinglike smoking, but safermakes it easy for users to believe vaping doesnt cause disease or death.

Itll be really interesting to see what the reaction of the exploding vape pen is since its so shocking, she told The Daily Beast. Its so dramatic that he blew himself up.

But the news that the FDA is cracking down on vaping, or that serious conditions like wet lung could occur as a result of vaping, will probably not register with the majority of vape users. Thats because the jury on the science of vaping remains hazy, simply because vaping is so new and accurate scientific analyses of its health effects require years of data.

What doesnt help is the social media marketing genius of companies like Juul. On Juuls Instagram (@juulvapor, whose bio is The satisfying alternative to cigarettes), the company appeals directly to its millennial and Gen X base with minimalist lifestyle-y posts that present juuling as cool, chic, and artistic, often promoting vaping as a substitute or alternative to smoking. Posts carry disclaimers about the nicotine content of Juuls and explicitly state that they are intended for use by adults.

But what makes Juuls social media marketing more surreptitious and potentially subversive is how its affiliate partners use Juuls upscale branding to carry the water for Juul, Emery said.

That means Juul maintains a pristine legal front image of being only marketed for adults, but those who service Juul could reach out to teens and bring in that valuable demographic without sullying the brands reputation.

Emery says vaping seems bulletproof against negative news coverage because of the industrys expert use of social media and take advantage of the as-yet-unknown verdict on the health front. Their marketing is spectacular, she said. Theyve really found a way to reach teens.

Emery and her colleagues will publish a study soon that shows the spike in Juul-related tweets in the past year. The number remains flat between February 2015 and December 2016, when tweets start to jump. Theres a minor bump in the summer of 2017, but between October 2017 and December 2017, Juul-related tweets go from about 20,000 per month to close to 160,000 tweets per month. (The study is not yet published, though it has been reviewed and accepted, which is why The Daily Beast cant publish the graph in question.)

Juuls initial arrival on social media was rather boring, which may explain the initial low numbers, says Emery. When Juul came on our radar, there were daily fluctuations, but you didnt see that dramatic rise till just then, she said. But the affiliate accounts are expert teen talkers: They tap into meme culture. They come up with these great memes that tie back to the devices and make them cool, make people want to try them, she said.

Its not a new technique, to be sure: Emery and other tobacco industry researchers have long pointed to the industrys keen understanding of its demographic to market its products. Think of the Marlboro cowboys brash, stereotypical masculinity, or Virginia Slims, whose slimmer design played into many womens desire to appear more elegant and chic while smoking. Vaping is doing the same thing with its shrewd understanding of demographicsexcept now its playing into a more vulnerable, younger audience.

To most vapers, Emery says, wet lung sounds gross and terrible, but also distant and something that might have happened to the woman just because of bad luck. Its far away, vapings technically not been proved to be unhealthy, and the electronic puff not only looks cool but its fruity or candy-tinged flavor is pretty tasty, too.

It doesnt help that vapings root word, vapor, conjures images of steam, something water-based and otherwise innocent. Cigarette smoke smells like tar, burns a visible filter, and tastes like eating smoke (with menthol, minty smoke). Vaping, on the other hand, is sleek, cool, gently foggy, with a light flavor that makes the smoking experience more pleasurable than bumming a light from whoever is on the corner.

So does that mean were stuck? That nothing can make vaping look uncool and potentially save hundreds of thousandsmaybe millionsof lives?

Andy Tan is with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. A new study he and his co-authors published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence seems to suggest that PSAs might earn eyerolls, but they also could be effectiveespecially if they have a lot of smoke in their imagery.

Tan and his team thought portrayals of vaping might trigger stronger urges to smoke among adults who are smoking and vaping at the same time, perhaps using vaping as a potential substitute for smoking or a way to quit smoking. The thought process was that vivid vaping imagery with plumes of smoke might act as a trigger.

But thats not what happened at all. The study used 171 smokers and 122 dual users between 21 and 30, showed them various PSAs, then asked about any change in habits that ensued. It turned out that smokers who were exposed to anti-vaping PSAs with vapors in the imagery versus the actual act of vaping were turned off from the practice and claimed a lowered intention to smoke and purchase cigarettes or vape in the next hour. Dual users also found the cloud of smoke off-putting.

Why thats the case is still unclear to Tan and his team, though Tan did point to various iconic anti-smoking PSAs that feature clouds of smoke. Perhaps the smoke makes what one is really breathing incancerous fumesmore real, less sexy, and more immediate than carefully curated images of vapes on Instagram. Young people, Tan said, found the vapor, not the vape, off-putting, which means that so long as adolescents and those in their 20s see images of vapes being used with minimal or next to no smoke, theres not muchnot even bad newsthat can make vaping look not attractive outside of billowing smoke.

Of course, Tan said this study has huge caveats: It needs to be replicated, he told The Daily Beast. And we only had two sites, one in Boston and another in Lansing, Michigan, so we cant say this is generalizable. But he does agree with Emery that news of death by vape doesnt matter to vapers: Young people dont really read the news, he said. Its a very temporary negative slant on the product.

Frankly, I dont think it will make a difference, Emery said of the recent spate of negative news on vaping. Vapers gonna vape, it seems."
2018-10-23,Daily Beast,Trump Rallies With Cruz Who No One Really Likes,"Everything in Texas is just bigger, Donald Trump said on Monday night in Houston. At one point, he even referred to one-time presidential rival Ted Cruz as a really good friend of mine.

With Donald Trump stumping for him on the hustings in Texas, Ted Cruz looks well positioned for reelection in November.

But thats nothing to brag about. A Republican president shouldnt have to go to Texas in October to campaign for an incumbent GOP Senator, nor should there be any doubt about a Republican Senators reelection in the Lone Star State.

A Republican beating a Democrat in Texas is like the Dallas Cowboys defeating Texas A&M. Its not an accomplishment... its what youre supposed to do.

Thanks partly to the Kavanaugh effect, but mostly just due to political gravity reasserting itself, Ted Cruz will likely cruise to victory on November 6. (Theres always a chance the stars will align, and ORourke will pull off a miracle. But that looks increasingly unlikely.)

On the heels of Trumps Texas speech, it now appears Team Cruz can breathe a sigh of relief. Instead, they should be vowing to correct their past mistakes.

The fundamental problems persist. Ted Cruz is unlikeable, and the Republican Party faces a looming demographic catastrophe in Texas.

First, though, the lay of the land: Right now, Cruz is leading ORourke by 7 to 10 points among likely voters. The bad news for Cruz, though, is that ORourke has a 24-point lead among Hispanics.

To win the election, ORourke would have to win something like 67% of Hispanic votes. That probably wont happen, but the fact that it wont should be cold comfort for Cruz.

As recently as 2014, Republican John Cornyn actually won the Latino vote in Texas. Just four years later, Cruz (who is Hispanic) will perform significantly worse among Latinos than Cornyn. In fairness, ORourke is an exceptionally appealing candidate, who also happens to be a fluent Spanish speaker. ORourke deserves credit, but the main person to blame for Ted Cruz being in this predicament is Ted Cruz.

Almost immediately upon winning election to the Senate, Cruzs ego and ambition stunned even those of us who are close watchers of politicians. Instead of paying his dues, being a team player, and learning the ropes, Cruz immediately seized the spotlight by saying and doing the kind of outrageous and provocative things that someone, circa 2012, might imagine a Republican would have to say and do to win a Republican caucus in Iowa.

It didnt have to be this way. What ifand stick with me herewhat if, instead of spending a couple of years gallivanting around Iowa, Ted Cruz had devoted himself to Texas?

What if he were more interested in Abilene than Ames, more focused on Dallas than Des Moines?

Instead, Cruz chose to attack Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to cause a government shutdown as part of a quixotic plan to defund Obamacare, and then to spend a ton of time and energy (and donors money) running for president (where, ironically, he was humiliated by Donald Trumpwho essentially called Heidi Cruz ugly and suggested Cruzs dad was somehow involved in the Kennedy assassination).

Imagine if, instead of spending all of that time running for president, Cruz had gone hyper-local. He might have devoted himself to Hispanic outreach, helping identify, recruit, and train young Texas Latinos to run for local office as Republicans. Imagine if he devoted himself to keeping Texas Republican for a generation, using his status as a prominent Hispanic-American Republican to head up a well-funded outreach operation.

Despite being poised to win in November, to many Americans, Ted Cruz is simply not likablesomeone who is seen as overly ambitious and phony. Hes a cross between a slick lawyer and a fire-and-brimstone preachera Republican simulacrum of Al Gore circa 2000 (although Gore actually won his partys nomination).

Instead of putting his political ambitions first, Cruz should spend the next six years putting the Republican Party and the people of the state of Texas first. (He appears to have received this message. This weekend, Cruz pledged that if re-elected, he would serve a full six-year term.)

Lets be honest: Fixing Ted Cruz is a heavy lift, but even that is still only part of the equation. The larger problem is that his likely victory next month will only serve to mask the fact that Texas Republicans face a demographic challenge. As the Texas Tribune observes, Since 2010, Texas has gained more than three times as many Hispanic residents than whites.

Unlike California, Texas Republicans have generally been able to perform fairly well with Hispanics (see George W. Bush and John Cornyn). But since the rise of the Tea Party (and now, the election of Donald Trump), Republicans fear of Hispanics voting as a bloc for Democrats might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Again, ORourke is an exceptional candidate, but if you consider that Cornyn won the Hispanic vote in 2014 and that Cruz is losing it by 24 points, this trend does not bode well for Republicans.

For years now, political observers have been warning that Texas is changing. Every time that outcome fails to materialize, it reinforces the notion its just talk. Elections are a lagging indicator of demographic change. Ultimately, though, demographics can be destiny.

Lets be clear: If Republicans start out with an electoral map that shows them losing California and New Yorkand then have to fight tooth and nail just to win Texasits essentially game over.

Instead of celebrating, Cruz and Texas Republicans need to rededicate themselves to finding a way to win the future.

If theyre smart, they wont let a likely victory keep them from confronting some serious challenges ahead. Instead of celebrating on November 6th, Ted Cruz and the Republican Party should both consider that they just dodged a (metaphorical) bullet. And more are headed their way."
2018-09-28,Daily Beast,Azealia Banks vs Grimes Might Have Gotten Elon Musk Sued by the SEC,"If Elon Musk had smoked weed in high school and didnt try so hard around women, then maybe Securities and Exchange Commission wouldnt be suing him for fraud.

In a Thursday filing, the SEC accused the Tesla founder and CEO of making misleading statements about Teslas finances. The feds said Musk had falsely suggested in an August tweet that he had secured the funding to take his company private when its stock hit $420 per share. Tesla did not even have discussions about funding, let alone the money, the SEC alleges. Instead, Musk allegedly cited the $420 figure to impress his then-girlfriend, electro-pop musician Grimes, who had recently taught him about the numbers significance in marijuana culture.

Grimes role came to light last month after she feuded with the rapper Azealia Banks, who leaked Grimes texts about Musks bizarre behavior at an ill-fated mansion hangout.

Am considering taking Tesla private at $420, Musk tweeted on August 7. Funding secured.

420 is a weed culture in-joke about the time of day to smoke, 4:20.

Musk, 47, is apparently new to marijuana. He got into weed cuz of me, Grimes texted Banks last month, according to screenshots the rapper leaked. Musk is super entertained by 420, Grimes continued. Musk made headlines earlier this month for smoking a joint on a podcast, taking uncomfortable puffs of smoke and grimacing on camera.

Banks portrayed Musk as an out-of-control drug novice in a long Instagram story last month. Banks claimed she had flown to California for a music collaboration with Grimes.

I waited around all weekend while grimes coddled her boyfriend for being too stupid to know not to go on twitter while on acid, Banks wrote, adding that she was staying with the couple. They invited me here to stay and told me I couldnt bring my boyfriend ... it was probably some weird threesome sex shit to begin with.

Banks went on to accuse Musk of begging investors for money on the phone while she was there. Grimes and Banks later exchanged texts in attempt to repair their relationship. Banks leaked those texts which included one predicting Musks forthcoming SEC trouble.

He just got into weed cuz of me and hes super entertained by 420 so when he decided to take the stock private he calculated it was worth 419$ so he rounded up to 420 for a laugh and now the sec is investigating him for fraud, Grimes texted Banks, according to the leaked texts. cool! well that bodes well.

The SEC reached a similar conclusion in its Thursday complaint against Musk.

Musk stated that he rounded the price up to $420 because he had recently learned about the number's significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price.

For all Musks attempts to impress Grimes, its not clear the pair are still dating. They unfollowed each other on social media last month, spurring speculation that they had broken up.

Banks, meanwhile, has suggested that she and Grimes collaborate on music about Musks SEC investigation.

Grimes and I need to finish our song and make the soundtrack to this investigation, the rapper told Business Insider. Music is powerful and the songs we started on were clutch."
2018-11-05,Daily Beast,Christine Hallquist Gina Ortiz Jones and the Other LGBT Candidates to Watch Out For in the Midterm,"On Election Night 2018, there are more LGBT-related storylines to follow than just the sheer number of out candidatesalmost 250, according to recent estimates. Tuesdays vote could also deliver the first transgender governor, the first openly bisexual Senator, and the first body of Congress to pass the long-anticipated Equality Act.

At the same time, one state might end up repealing statewide nondiscrimination protections for transgender people via public vote for the first timeand no, its not a red one.

Indeed, underneath what LGBT advocates have dubbed a rainbow wave is a midterm that could prove monumental in myriad ways for a community that has seen many of its rights fights stall under the Trump administration. Here are five stories to watchand what they would mean for LGBT people.

Former energy company CEO and openly transgender woman Christine Hallquist won the Democratic primary in the Vermont gubernatorial race back in August, but she has to overcome steep odds Tuesday against Republican incumbent Phil Scott, who recently posted a 14-point lead in a poll conducted by Vermont Public Radio and Vermont PBS.

Hallquist herself joked in an interview with The Daily Beast that she is more interested in becoming the first Vermont governor to unseat an incumbent since 1962 than she is in becoming the first transgender governor in United States history.

If she wins Tuesday, Hallquist would also be the highest-ranking transgender elected official in the country because, to date, there has never been a transgender person in the Congress. Still, as Hallquist previously told The Daily Beast, shes campaigning not on national precedents but on local issues: In Vermont, Im going to get elected because of what I do for Vermonters, she said.

Shes not the only LGBT gubernatorial candidate who could make history Tuesday night, either. LGBT advocacy group Freedom for All Americans told The Daily Beast in an email that, in effect, every letter of the acronym will be covered in a gubernatorial race this year: Jared Polis, who is openly gay, is running for Colorado governor; Oregon governor Kate Brown, who is bisexual, is up for reelection; and Texas Lupe Valdez would be the first out lesbian governor in the country.

Pay no mind to the fact that Massachusetts is a blue state. So is California, and LGBT advocates still grimace at the memory of Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot initiative that made same-sex marriage illegal in the Golden State.

On Tuesday night, Massachusetts could set a very different sort of precedent than the one it set 14 years ago when it became the first state to permit same-sex marriage: Thanks to a ballot measure known as Question 3, it could become the first state to roll back transgender protections through a public vote.

The protections in question prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity in public accommodations like restroomsand they were signed into law by Republican Governor Charlie Baker in 2016.

But a concerted effort from anti-transgender groups has put the question on the ballot in whats been seen as a political test for the viability of such measures: If you can roll back transgender rights in LGBT-friendly Massachusetts, the logic goes, you can roll them back anywhere.

Polling on the question was initially closer than LGBT many advocates expected this June, with nearly 40 percent of voters across two polls saying that they would vote against the protections.

A more recent poll by Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, however, suggests that LGBT rights groups may have successfully made their case: 68 percent said they would vote Yes to keep the protections while only 28 percent said they would vote No.

LGBT advocates like to quote a common saying: If youre not at the table, youre on the menu. In this context, that means that if LGBT people arent holding elected office, their rights are more endangered.

Election Night 2018 could see several LGBT people pulling seats up to that most coveted of figurative political tables: the U.S. Congress.

Today, there are only seven openly LGBT people in Congress. This year, advocacy group Victory Fund has endorsed 14 LGBT people running for either the House or the Senatesome of them running for re-election, but many of them relative newcomers.

To date, for example, there have only been two openly lesbian or bisexual women in Congress: Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin and Arizona congresswoman Krysten Sinema, who is now running for Senate.

Depending on Tuesday nights results, they could be joined by Lauren Baer from Florida, Iraq War veteran Gina Ortiz Jones from Texas, openly bisexual woman Katie Hill from California, Tracy Mitrano from New York, Angie Craig from Minnesota, and Sharice Davis from Kansas.

Several men, too, would be the first openly gay member of Congress from their state: Rick Neal in Ohio, Chris Pappas in New Hampshire, and Sean Patrick Maloney in New York.

One important LGBT moment that might happen Tuesday night has more to do with general control over the House than it does with electing LGBT candidates specifically.

In 2015 and 2017, Democratic lawmakers in both the House and the Senate introduced the Equality Act, a federal bill that would ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity at the federal level.

Legislatively speaking, this is the brass ring for the LGBT community: a simple law that would apply in all 50 states, regardless of existing local laws or previous court rulings. Many fights would be won overnight. Of course, without control of Congress, the Equality Act has failed both yearsand there will still likely be years to come before it becomes law.

But if Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives as projected in many polling analyses, party leadership has promised to make passing the Equality Act a major priority, as The Daily Beast noted.

If Republicans maintain control over the Senate as expected, however, the bill would likely fail thereand President Trump would almost certainly veto it anyway.

Still, though, the Equality Act clearing a body of Congress for the first time would mark an important step forward for the bill, which will likely be introduced many more times before making it to a presidents desk.

In the short term, voting on the Equality Act in a Democratic House and sending it to a GOP-controlled Senate would help keep LGBT rights in the national political conversation at a time when support for LGBT people is growing among voters.

In the absence of the Equality Actand in the presence of a White House that has rolled back many key LGBT protectionsthe state-level fight for LGBT rights has never been more crucial.

Only 20 states and D.C. have laws that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, leaving wide swaths of the country unprotected.

Advocacy group Freedom for All Americans says that they are focused this election cycle on gubernatorial races in Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Michigan, and Arizona that could help determine whether non-discrimination laws get passed, with CEO Masen Davis saying in a statement that this would be one of the most important ways we can generate momentum for action at the federal level.

According to the Movement Advancement Project, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, and Arizona do not have any laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, although they are in some cases bound by federal court rulings that would ban such discrimination.

There are also a large number of LGBT candidates running for state legislature on Tuesdayand that table/menu saying would apply at this level as well.

According to Victory Fund, there are 213 out LGBT people who made the ballot for statewide office this yeara staggering number given current levels of representation. There are, the group noted, more LGBTQ people ... running for statewide office this cycle than at any other time in U.S. history.

According to a December 2017 report from the Victory Institute, there are currently a little over 100 openly LGBT state legislators nationwide. The effects of boosting that number, even by a little bit, would be no substitute for more sweeping federal-level LGBT protectionsbut it could help get new state laws passed in the meantime."
2018-02-28,Daily Beast,Roy Moore Consultants New Project A Conspiracy-Theorizing Pro-Trump News Site,"Veterans of failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moores campaign have quietly taken on their next venture: ownership of a right-wing news site run by a former Breitbart writer whos called Alex Jones my Walter Cronkite.

The site, Big League Politics, is a notable outpost of pro-Trump viewpoints and anti-liberal conspiracy theories on the internet. Its editorial division is run by Patrick Howley, a former writer for prominent conservative news sites such as Breitbart News, the Daily Caller, and the Washington Free Beacon.

Since its founding, Big League Politics (BLP) has been a standalone corporate entity. But earlier this year, it was acquired by Mustard Seed Media, a company run by a political consultant who previously worked for Moores campaign.

A merging of an ostensible news website with a political operation doesnt happen every day, and for good reason. Under its new ownership, Big League Politics will be in a position to cover high-profile political figures that are simultaneously paying consulting fees to the sites new owners.

But what made this new media-consulting hybrid even quirkier was what came after the acquisition.

Earlier this month, @MooreSenate, the Twitter account belonging to Moores campaign was transferred to Big League Politics. The accounts 75,000 or so followers were kept intact, but metadata shows that the accounts handle and profile were changed. The websites official Twitter account, meanwhile, was rebranded as Howleys personal account.

Asked about the acquisition of @MooreSenate, Reilly ONeal, who runs Mustard Seed Media, enthusiastically confirmed that it now owns Big League Politics.

Big League Politics is a fast-paced news site led by a team of talented investigative reporters, filmmakers, and citizen journalists who are determined to report the truth when the mainstream media wont, ONeal told The Daily Beast in an email.

ONeal declined to provide details about how BLP came into possession of the Moore campaign Twitter account. But he himself has business ties to the failed Alabama candidate. Moores campaign paid two of ONeals other companies more than $730,000, according to Federal Election Commission records. It paid another $130,000 in total to GOP consultant Noel Fritsch, a firm Fritsch runs, and another firm that lists his home in D.C. as its mailing address.

Both Fritsch and ONeal have collaborated on a number of political projects and, a source familiar with Big League Politics operations says both are now heavily involved with the website.

Fritsch did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did Howley.

In conservative journalism circles, the BLP editor in chief is seen as a talented writer who is nonetheless prone to unhinged outbursts. At the Daily Caller, he was known to send rambling, occasionally incoherent, late-night emails to the entire newsroom.

His far-right politics and conspiratorial take on opposition to President Donald Trump color the editorial tone of Big League Politics, which he has led since its inception last year. Among the under-covered stories that BLP has focused on is a conspiracy theory surrounding the 2016 murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich. The site has published dozens of stories fueling speculation that the murder was related to the release of DNC emails that the U.S. intelligence community believes were obtained by Russian hackers.

In a column for the Daily Caller shortly after Trumps inauguration, Howley hailed a leading Seth Rich conspiracist, right-wing radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, as a journalistic paragon, and detailed the nefarious deep state conspiracy out to undermine the new, transformative president.

Barack Obama from the White House pushed us in the direction of outright civil war in the streets, Howley wrote. Now, hes acting like Robert E. Lee if hed never surrendered at Appomattox, waging a guerrilla campaign in the foothills to destabilize the American republic for years to come. And unlike Lee, hes acting under the supervision of George Soros and his Muslim Brotherhood overseers.

Those sorts of conspiracy theories have earned Big League Politics attention and traffic on the pro-Trump right. But the site has had a hard time translating that traffic into a steady revenue stream, according to a plugged-in source familiar with its operations.

Its initial deal with Mustard Seed, which put the company in charge solely of advertising, was a way to boost its promotional efforts and bring in some ad dollars. But ONeal was more interested in taking over the site wholesale, though the terms of the sites transfer to Mustard Seed remain unclear.

In its new corporate form, Big League Politics is under the auspices of consultants whove made millions campaigning for the types of political candidates that receive friendly coverage from Howley and his crew of reporters.

Big League Politics has written favorably, for instance, about Paul Nehlen, the white nationalist Republican candidate challenging House Speaker Paul Ryan. Nehlens campaign has paid Fritsch about $32,500 in salary and consulting fees since last year. Its also paid Capital Square Funding Group, ONeals fundraising firm, about $7,000 this cycle.

The site has also extensively covered Corey Stewart, a former candidate for Virginia governor and now a contender for U.S. Senate in the state. Stewarts gubernatorial campaign paid Fritsch and ONeals consulting firm, Tidewater Strategies. His Senate campaign has paid Capital Square and Fritschs Southern Pines Strategies.

Big League Politics isnt ONeals first foray into the political news business, and at least one other media property he controls has promoted his consulting firms clients. First in Freedom Daily, a North Carolina-centric conservative news site owned by Mustard Seed Media, has promoted political efforts by two of ONeals clients: North State Leadership Council and North Carolina Gun Rights.

Stories promoting both of those groups were written by Spencer Hardison, who works for Tidewater. Hardison began contributing to Big League Politics this month."
2018-10-18,Daily Beast,Dear God Hillary Clinton Please Just Go,"Were three weeks out from the 2018 midterm election, and Hillary Clinton is popping up again like a Halloween ghoul who keeps rising from the grave to terrorize the American public; only this time accompanied by the increasingly #MeToo burdened uber-villain, Bubba.

The Clintons, it seems, cant seem to call it quits, even if it means leaving members of their own party cringing and many more voters ready to headdesk themselves into a coma.

This time, its happening courtesy of a pay-through-the-nose-to-see-them rehab tour. Because if theres one thing America hasnt had enough of over recent decades, its efforts by the Clintons to recast themselves as normal, likeable people, as they cash checks and play the victim.

Previous editions of this show have included Hillarys two Senate runs and two presidential runs, which, depending on ones perspective, were either an attempt to show independence from her husband or to be compensated for his myriad screw ups.

But despite the last run ending with a loss to Donald Freaking Trump, the most flawed candidate Republicans could conceivably have run in 2016, it appears that nothing will get Hillary out of our political debate once and for all.

Hillary remains caught up in the delusion that the only reason she lost in 2016 was because of Russian interference. She does not seem to have fully processed the fact that she lost the electoral college, the only vote that counts.  She touts the fact that she got nearly three million more votes than Trump while conveniently leaving out that her tally of the vote still fell well below 50 percent.

Both of the major party nominees in 2016 were so unlikable, flawed andlets be candidunethical that lots of us just couldnt pull the lever for her even if we couldnt stand Trump. According to a study from American National Election Studies, the words most associated by voters with Hillary in 2016 were experienced liar. Is it logical that shed want to rehab her image, given all this? Perhaps. Is it possible? No. Do we need to watch her try? Definitely, definitely, definitely not.

That might be especially the case if youre a Democrat.

Hillarys continual pursuit of limelight and headlines ensures that the image of the Democratic Party remains an outdated, outmoded, and frankly despicable for far too many voters. This comes at a time when leading Democrats are attempting to focus voters attention on the future2020, and beating Trumpand jostling for the role as the new party leader.

It also undercuts Democrats positioning as the only party that really cares about #MeToo and that will fight for survivors, a contrast Dems are only too keen to spotlight in the wake of Brett Kavanaughs confirmation to the Supreme Court and ongoing allegations about President Trumps treatment of women.  Only sheer partisan convenience could allow someone to insist that Dr. Christine Blasey Fords testimony is credible while downplaying the numerous allegations of mistreatment (and worse) made by women against Bill Clinton.

For the Democratic Party, about the best that can come of this latest Clinton revival is that no matter how unpalatable any of its leading lightsSen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Sen. Cory Booker, or othersare individually, theyll look like downright appealing the longer Hillary hangs about.

But her doing so does not signal that the Democratic Party is actually living in the present, and focused on beating Trump. Rather, it suggests the party wants to turn American politics into the new edition of Groundhog Dayonly with no Bill Murray or actual groundhog. Isnt it time to let the Democratic Party move on from its Clintonite past, and to give someone else a go?

One of the reasons Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been so refreshing isnt just because the more Democratic Socialist-driven, modern Democratic Partywhich is populated to a greater degree by younger voterswants a younger, more progressive avatar to embrace. Its also because even Republicans are starting to get weary of bashing the Clintons now; though some of us will undertake it still as a public service.

Clinton is like the target youve already shot dead-on so many times the paper has gone to shreds. There are few more column inches to be written, but even Fox News personalities have begun to act a little bored when they dive into Hillary-focused narratives these days.

All of which suggests that for Republicans, too, its time to move onto fresh fights, with fresh adversaries. We want the newest bad guy, not the evildoer from the biggest show in the freaking 1990s. Maybe in 2020 that will be Warren, Gillibrand, Harris, or Booker, or any one of the other 20-some people that might potentially run for president on the Democratic side. But its a dead certainty that it isnt the lady weve seen inveighing against the right wing for stealing things she seems to think she or her husband are inherently entitled to for decades now.

Its time for Hillary and Bill to get off the stage and quit seeking the public adoration theyre clearly never going to get to the massive degree they crave it. Be content, like so many other party elders who turned out not to be winners, in working behind the scenes to help to deliver wins for other, better, up-and-coming, appealing voices.

Yes, others have stuck around past their primes. Mitt Romney, a candidate with a similar resume of high profile presidential losses, is now running for Senate. But his circumstances are different. He was asked to run for the seat that he will soon occupy by its current occupant and hes maintained strong ties to Utah. Even then, his continuing presence on the political stage irks a ton of Americans who wish he too would go away quietly.

So, Hillary, ditch the rehab tour. Dispense with TV appearances. Recognize that whether its lauded or not, you did make some kind of a difference (yes, even Hillary did a couple of things right in her various terms in public office), and be content to leave it there.

Zombie movies for Halloween are fun. But whether youre a Democrat, a Republican, or neither, theres only so much zombie politics you can take. Thats what the Clintons essentially offer nowa brain-devouring, egocentric version of Democrat-ism lurching and festering onward, seemingly endlessly."
2018-10-10,Daily Beast,Taylor Swift and Cardi B Rock the American Music Awards Red Carpet,"Cardi B was back to her flamboyant best on the AMAs red carpet. Taylor Swift shimmered. Other stars chose pink, while a few were paying shoulder-padded homage to 1980s Dynasty."
2018-03-25,Daily Beast,Stormy Will Eat You Alive How a Porn Star is Making Trump Worlds Lives Hell,"As the 2016 presidential campaign entered its homestretch, Donald Trump and his team were drowning in the fallout of the infamous grab em by the pussy tape and the torrent of sexual assault and harassment allegations that were subsequently made against the future president.

It was like walking through a minefield every day [in that last month], a former Trump campaign adviser recalled to The Daily Beast.

But in that final month on the trail, there was something else weighing on Trumps mind, even more than the assault allegations. According to three top campaign officials, speaking to The Daily Beast on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, Trump began pressing senior staffers about the specific dates that the women were alleging that the assaults, affairs, or harassment took place.

If the date fell within the time period of the early stage of his marriage to Melania Trumpand the birth of their son BarronTrump would suddenly care more about the story and quiz campaign aides more closely about it. Officials concluded that Trumps true concern was not so much being accused of sexual harassment as it was, in the words of one aide, about pissing off Melania.

One of these accounts of a consensual relationship that drew Trumps intensified interest was published at the website The Smoking Gun under the title, Donald Trump And The Porn Superstar. The piece reported on Trumps alleged sexual affair with Stephanie Clifford, an adult-film actress known by her stage name, Stormy Daniels. Such an affair would have taken place not only while Donald and Melania Trump were newlyweds, but soon after Barron was born.

A year into the Trump era, the story of Stormy has morphed from a late-campaign nuisance into large-scale presidential crisis.

The president may be able to fire Mr. [Robert] Mueller and others who may challenge him, but he cannot fire me, or my client. We will not be going away any time soon, Michael Avenatti, Daniels attorney, told The Daily Beast. If they [in Trumpworld] are upset about what has transpired over the last two weeks, they are really going to be upset when they see what is going to transpire over the next few monthsbecause the last two weeks havent been a warm-up lap.

Inside the chronically chaos-driven Trump White House, Stormy Daniels is a high-profile hassle and headache that now must be managed on a daily basis. According to two sources familiar with the situation, the White House press operation has at least one person whose job it is to monitor the latest developments on the Daniels front.

Senior Trump aides say they generally go out of their way not to talk to the president about the tsunami of press coverage. Why would I talk? one White House official asked, noting how uncomfortable an exercise it would be. With everything else going on, why would I want to do that?

Publicly, the White House strategy of handling the Stormy situation, aides say, is simple: Stress that the White House has previously addressed the matter, they have nothing to add, and move on to the next question.

The presidents outward-facing approach has been steadfast silencea stark contrast to how aggressively hes gone after women whove accused him of sexual misconduct. When the White House press corps yells questions at him about Stormy, he stays mum. His Twitter feed has yet to address the continuous coverage of the alleged affair on cable news.

But even as the president has stayed publicly silent on the issue, he and his team have ramped up a legal effort to fight it.

Trump has hired Charles Harder, known for representing Hulk Hogan in the sex-tape lawsuit that decimated Gawker. (On March 16, Harder filed court papers announcing Trump would join Essential Consultantsthe LLC his longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen created to pay Danielsand request her lawsuit change venues from Los Angeles County to federal court, as well as enter private arbitration.)

Brent Blakely, who represented Paris Hilton in a trademark lawsuit against Hallmark, was retained by both Essential Consultants and Trump. In a court filing, Blakely claimed one or both of them could seek $20 million in damages against Daniels, or $1 million per violation of her nondisclosure agreement.

And Jill Martin, a Trump Organization attorney, has signed an arbitration document for Essential Consultants. News of her apparent involvement raised eyebrows, as it seemed to contradict Cohens claim that President Trump wasnt a party to the hush agreement and $130,000 payout to Daniels. Martin told The Wall Street Journal she filed the paperwork in her individual capacity until a New York-based attorney was approved to practice in California. But it also suggested that Trumpland was taking the matter increasingly seriously, no longer content to try and brush it away.

The legal escalation comes as Daniels has shown little sign of being intimidated into silence. She gave a brief, largely biographical, interview to The New York Times and is set to appear on 60 Minutes Sunday eveningan appearance Trumpworld was considering seeking an injunction to stop, according to one report.

Daniels attorney also has suggested that more will come after the 60 Minutes episode airs. On Thursday, Avenatti posted a cryptic Twitter photo of a compact disc in a safe, apparently hinting that Daniels may have photographic or even video evidence of her relationship with Trump.

As the Daniels saga has persisted in the news, pro-Trump allies outside the White House have responded with shrugs. Some even suggest that the charges maybe be part of a vast anti-Trump conspiracy.

When I first met Donald Trump in the 1980s, he was known as a playboy. His playboy nature is baked into his candidate model today, Michael Caputo, a Republican operative and a veteran of Trumps presidential run, told The Daily Beast. The same people who attempted to find and fund women who would make allegations against [Trump] in 2016, I believe, are the same forces behind the not-so-coincidental lawsuits now, initiated by Stormy Daniels.

Caputo added that in the end, after the entire 1990s debacle behind [Bill] Clinton and his paramours... he came out of the presidency wounded but vindicated... Donald Trump will be wounded but vindicated.

But if anyone can take down a president, Stormy Daniels is the one, friends and colleagues argue.

Stormy will eat you alive, Michael Vegas, an adult performer who starred in Daniels Unbridled, told The Daily Beast. She has a reputation in the business where people are afraid of her. But not because of a mean streak, Vegas added. She simply knows what she wants and how to be direct.

Shes not a numskull, the actor said. I believe she has the gusto and bravado to actually pull this off. When asked what he meant, Vegas replied: Expose the president for what hes been doing. Expose him for his hypocrisy.

Rachel Starr, another X-rated actress, called Daniels one of the most respected women in the porn industry but someone whos notoriously private.

I think its safe to make the assumption that she knows something, said Starr, who maintains her neutrality when it comes to politics and Daniels battle with Trump. I would find it very hard to believe that she would bring something to the public eye, to this level, if there wasnt any substance to what she is saying.

Even without Trump using his large bullhorn and social media presence to attack her, the pressure being placed on Daniels has been heavy. Alana Evans, who previously revealed that Trump chased Daniels around his hotel room in his tighty-whities, told The Daily Beast that she and Daniels are receiving threats from Trump supporters, angry at the soap opera engulfing the White House.

Theres a crazy who has been sending Stormy threatening emails, said Evans, who says the same man tried to add her on Facebook. The alleged stalker told Daniels that hes going to kill her at her dance appearances, and have his army come for her and at one particular strip performance, he was going to shoot her, Evans said.

Evans, a fellow porn actress, said the industry is gloating over what Daniels has already done. And though Trump may be acting as if nothing is taking place at all, they are confident that he will, eventually, have to answer for his actions.

She is taking him on, Evans added. And its going to be her words, if anyones, that takes that man down."
2018-09-02,Daily Beast,The Insane Experience of Riding the Worlds Highest Tidal Wave,"Dont white knuckle this part, our guide says from behind the wheel of the red zodiac as we bomb along the brown river. Save that for when the tidal bore comes. Were on the Shubenacadie River (Shubie for short) in Nova Scotia, Canada, waiting for the highest tides in world to come barreling back into the Bay of Fundy and up the river.

Weve already been well briefed that we will get very wet. Our boat will fill with water. And if we like our sunglasses and hats, we should stash them because they are unlikely to stay on our heads. Were also told to cinch up our life jackets nice n tight in case our guide has to grab the handle at the neck and pull us out of the river. Kim Artz has fished out more than a few rafters in her 18 years of guiding on the Shubenacadie. Ninety-nine percent of them are laughing when I get them, she assures us with a grin, her blonde ponytail flying.

Artz and her colleagues at Tidal Bore Rafting Resort study the tide tables and know exactly when the tide comes in to the Bay of Fundyall 53 feet of itand when the action will start and stop on the river. Theyve been taking guests out on the river since the 80s, and in the years since a handful of other outfitters have joined the fun, loading zodiacs with up to eight people (plus a guide) to motor on the river for a few hours.

Dozens of rivers around the world experience tidal bores. Its the first wave of water that rushes back into a river as the tides rise in the adjacent ocean. Tidal bores from Alaska to India attract hard core surfers. Others are too dangerous to play with. Some only happen a couple of times a year. But here on the sandy Shubenacadie, the tidal bore reverses the flow of the river twice a day, every day, creating the only place on Earth thats ideal for up-river rafting. (If youre a really keen on tidal bores, you can learn more dropping by the free Fundy Tidal Interpretive Centre a few miles up the road).

As we wait for the tide to do its thing, our flotilla of zodiacs pulls up to a sandbar to kill a little time. We get out and wander around. We write our names in the sand and wade into the shallow water to cool off, floating on our backs for a while. Then we hop back into the zodiacs and motor past red cliffs of mud while trying to keep count of dozens of bald eagles flying in and out of the tree tops. Its all very peaceful as we wait for 160 billion metric tons of tidal water to come sloshing back our way.

Eventually Artz announces nonchalantly, Here comes the tidal bore. We look up to see a big white wave bearing down in the distance. Its moving at a pretty good clip, about seven miles an hour. Artz hits the gas in the zodiac and hugs the shoreline as we head toward the wave. I tuck my hat into my life jacket, double check the straps are tight, and reach behind me to start white knuckling the ropes tethered to the zodiac.

We overshoot the tidal bore, turn around to go with the flow and head straight into four or maybe five foot waves. The first one washes over us and, as promised, drenches us to the bone. The second wave fills the boat to the brim before draining out the back. As we gear up for the third wave, the woman across from me starts laughing, maybe manically. Im laughing too, but Ive learned very quickly to keep my mouth shut as we crash into the moguls of water.

Unlike white-water rafting, where the river rushes over rocks, this water is taking the shape of waves as it rushes over the sand, says Artz. I dont understand the physics of standing waves, but I do get that its a good idea to brace my legs against the side of the zodiac as we circle back for another go. Artz moves fast to get in as many runs as we can before the roller coaster ride ends. As the water gets higher, you lose the friction from the sand that causes the waves, and the river goes flat, she says.

We get in six or seven trips in about 20 minutes before heading to a narrower part of the river where the brown water is churning violently and looks, I think, the way things will appear at end times. This is the washing machine and we go through the cycle a few times. Finally, thoroughly washed, rinsed and spun out, the zodiacs take us to the river bank where we ditch our life jackets to go mud sliding.

You guys are always our entertainment at the mud slides, says Artz. Its hard to decide which is more fun: climbing up the banks looking for footholds in the thick gobs of chocolate mousse-like mud or sliding down and landing in the river with a splash. Regardless of our ages, and theres a big range, were all behaving like were eight years old. The adults are always the last ones back in the zodiacs, says Artz. Sure enough, the guides have to tell us more than once to climb back in. We do, eventually, and a little reluctantly, and we arrive back at the resort wet, muddy, and happy.

And maybe a little more curious about the magic of tides. Theres nothing like learning about the gravitational pull of a celestial body than slamming into a wave or two. But as opposed to white water rafting, where you have to wear a helmet and know what youre doing, on this river trip (which costs about $45 to $73 [$60 to $95 CDN]) grade school kids to grandmas just need to know how to hang on in this real-life water park.

After a couple of showers, I hang my once-blue-now-brown bathing suit on the deck at my cabin in the woods and walk to the campfire to swap muddy stories over samples of local beers and ciders. We eat dinner on a giant deck overlooking the now-gently flowing river. We feast on lobster, rolls, and salad. After a little bowl of ice cream and berries, we head back to the campfire for a few samples of rum and a few more stories. As we settle in for the night on the quiet banks of the Shubenacadie, lunar forces are at work pulling the water out again."
2018-09-24,Daily Beast,Team Trump Swears Its Not Trying to Overthrow Irans Mullahs,"The Trump administrations Iran hardliners want to underscore something as the United Nations annual diplomatic confab gets under way: theyre not trying to overthrow the Islamic Republic.

Regime change is not the administrations policy, John Bolton, President Donald Trumps national security adviser, said in response to a question from The Daily Beast. What we expect from Iran is massive changes in their behavior.

Boltons official disavowal of regime change is almost bound to hit a wall of skepticism. As The Daily Beast reported last week, on Saturday the presidents lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, spoke alongside a cultish Iranian exile leader at a conference devoted to replacing the Iranian government. The end of the Islamic Republic, could be in a few days, months, a couple of years. But its going to happen, Giuliani said.

That left senior administration officials once again scrambling to say theyre not planning on Iraq War 2.0. (Were not looking to do regime change anywhere, averred U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley on Sunday.)

Instead, Bolton told a press conference near the United Nations that, as the annual General Assembly opens, the U.S. is pushing a program of maximum pressuremuch like the administration termed its North Korea policy, which has yet to yield visible progress toward the unilateral North Korean nuclear disarmament Trump desires.

Its pathway to exert maximum pressure, however, is complicated by another major theme the president plans on pushing at this years summit, according to Bolton, Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Its a reprise of Trumps first U.N. speech, last yearnational sovereignty, something diplomats are likely to read Trump as defining in opposition to the U.N. and other multilateral institutions.

Waving a pocket constitution before reporters, Bolton portrayed sovereignty in nationalist and populist terms familiar from his tenure as U.N. ambassador in George W. Bushs administration. Infringements on sovereignty are not infringements on abstractions or infringements on the government, theyre infringements on the people themselves, Bolton said. The Constitution is the highest authority we recognize.

As he has throughout his diplomatic career, Bolton has expressed disdain for international institutions when their prerogatives diverge from U.S. interests. Two weeks ago, he warned that the U.S. would prosecute International Criminal Court officials who pursue an inquiry into alleged U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan, calling the court itself illegitimate.

Thats of a piece with major diplomatic rollbacks the Trump administration has pursued. Its abandoned the meticulously negotiated Paris climate accords on fossil-fuel emissions reductions, and it abrogated the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated along with France, Britain, China, Russia, Germany and supported by the European Union. The U.S.s European partners are now attempting the precarious balancing act of keeping Iran compliant with the spirit of the dealthat is, not restarting its shuttered nuclear programwhile navigating the return of American sanctions on their companies that seek to do business in Iran.

The administration thinks its Iran approach is working as Irans economy reels. Pompeo heralded a forthcoming November wave of sanctions that will target crude-oil exports and business with Irans central bank. On Wednesday, Trump will helm a U.N. Security Council session on counterproliferation that will focus substantially on Iran, in an effort to rally the world to join in the maximum-pressure campaign. You can bet the president will have well-deserved strong words for the Iranian regime, which is among the worst violators of U.N. Security Council resolutions, if not the absolute worst in the world, Pompeo said.

But that has to overcome substantial foreign and particularly European dissatisfaction at the U.S. for pulling out of the Iran deal and risking a path to war.

Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, laid out an agenda that runs counter to the one Trump will present this week. Defending multilateralism, he vowed to defend the Iran deal, the climate accords and multilateral bodies that Bolton rubbished, like the ICC and the U.N.s Palestinian-focused refugee agency.

I think President [Emmanuel] Macron will have a very frank conversation with President Trump, Le Drian told reporters at the French mission in New York. I think the two can take stock of what they disagree and agree on....Its not a confrontation. Trump and Macron are scheduled to meet one-on-one on Monday, a date when, Pompeo said, Trump will also meet with South Koreas Moon Jae-in and Egypts Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.

Whether its security issues, economic issues, human rights or anything else, the president is asking for countries to exert their sovereignty to solve challenges and listening to what America can do to help, Pompeo said Monday. But the thing about sovereignty is that other countries have it too and can exercise it in ways that frustrate Trumps agenda."
2018-04-13,Daily Beast,The Royal Shakespeare Companys New King Lear Is Pretty Funny for a Great Shakespearean Tragedy,"Are the characters in the Royal Shakespeare Companys latest production of King Lear, opening Thursday night at BAM Harvey Theater, having too much fun? It certainly feels so in places. Lear himself, the great tragic king of drama played by Antony Sher in this production directed by Gregory Doran, is here not the familiar booming then splintered regal foghorn of yore.

In Shers conception, Lear is mercurial, sprightly, impish, mischievouseven in the depths of his madness, betrayed and bereft, and zoning in and out of reality, he affects a little jig to dance off the stage.

It is a commanding performance, but it is also one that bucks Shakespeares text, and our expectations of it. Some of those great speeches and memorable lines bubble up from Shers throat. We catch them, but he deploys them as a fading elderly man rather than with guttural enunciation.

The charismatic Pappa Essiedu plays the villainous Edmond as less reptilian schemer and more bored and vengeful usurper of order. His illegitimacy is only one engine for him to target his father, Gloucester (David Troughton), and good brother Edgar (Oliver Johnstone). The rest of his letter-driven schemes is a chess game against himself to smirk and sneer through. Johnstone himself is marvelous, particularly for the long stretches of the play where hes clad only in skimpy cloth and covered in muck, ranting away as Poor Tom the beggar.

Goneril (Nia Gwynne) and Regan (Kelly Williams) are fabulously venomous, and also furious at their father Lears lackadaisical disregard for their futures. Lear condemns them in some of his memorable speeches of the playand Sher delights in each onebeginning with his initial ringing denunciation of poor Cordelia (Mimi Ndiweni), banished after not telling him she loves her father fulsomely enough. She is dressed in white at the beginning, but far from her scheming sisters meek and pliant victim.

The scuffed, peeling, ornate interior of the theater provides a natural backdrop for Shakespeares greatest tragedy. Niki Turners set design is a rough floor covering that is a kind of arena for the drama, and later becomes a sodden, outdoor backdrop when the storm comes. Little illuminated rivulets also course down the stage.

There is the odd blasted bush to signify heathland, and a softly lit backdrop that acts as a silhouette for an impressionistic battle scene. Lear is conveyed in at the beginning, wearing the most fabulous, shaggy coat, on top of a glass terrarium as if a regal specimen.

The see-through-box theme returns later as a container for the characters involved in the terrible plucking of Gloucesters eyes. This time the box just seems a hokey, unnecessary visual trick. If it was to stop the blood from spraying the audience in the front rows, the actors could have just looked off to the side.

At a key moment, when the drama of King Lear is at its most visceral, it separates the audience from its characters, and totally needlessly. It looks like a gimmick, particularly as the show is mostly period and suddenly we are facing the structural basics of a Damien Hirst installation.

Directors note: Yerma at the Park Avenue Armory does good box. Dont box for the sake of it. The production features color-blind casting, which is excellent, but its three messengers, waiting on others orders, are all played by black female actors, which seems at best a lazy oversight.

Certain parts of the text about power and corruption ring so true they merited the audiences sighs. Indeed, the attention to the text, the actors understanding of it, and their vivid animation of the words held us rapt for over three and a quarter hours.

Graham Turners Fool and Antony Byrnes Kentthe former in white with skullcap and pompoms, and the latter with head tattoosare particularly piercing, trying to help and cajole Lear with riddles that make devastating sense and rough comedy.

Think of Lear near the end, now all in white, a loose strait-jacket, and a regal laurel crown. He has learned that the mad are wise, the wise mad, and that heenabler, bully, loving, irascible, foolish, vain, lost and now foundis at the nexus of every contradiction about power that the play proposes. What is left for him but to imagine just playing and being with his beloved Cordelia, to show love and be loved, and need not much more?

Performances of King Lear continue at BAM until April 28. Book here."

2018-05-01,Daily Beast,57 Indicted in White Supremacist Meth and Kidnapping Scheme,"Fifty-seven people linked with six Texas white supremacist groups face charges in an alleged drug and kidnapping conspiracy, according to an indictment unsealed Monday.

The loose affiliation of Texas white supremacists allegedly trafficked meth across the state since at least 2015. But the network imploded when a member of the white supremacist Aryan Circle allegedly stole money from members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, blamed someone else, then helped kidnap and cut off part of the scapegoats finger.

The indictment from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, names the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, the Aryan Brotherhood (unrelated), the Aryan Circle (a splinter group of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas), the Peckerwoods (loosely affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas), the Soldiers of Aryan Culture, and the Dirty White Boys. The groups, many of which incorporate Nazi imagery, are known for their involvement in drug trafficking.

In 2016, feds charged 17 Aryan Brotherhood of Texas affiliated-people who allegedly ran a meth ring across east Texas. Aryan Circle members were also recently indicted in Louisiana for the murder of one of their own members. Although the Aryan Circle members claimed the man was killed in a random convenience store shooting, authorities reportedly overheard the victims wife and another woman discussing plans for a coverup while on the phone with 911.

The six white supremacist groups allegedly worked to traffic meth with Tango Blast, a collection of predominately Hispanic gangs in Texas.

Throughout the investigation, agents stopped the flow or seized over 190 kilograms of methamphetamine, 31 firearms, and seized approximately $376,587 in cash, the U.S. Attorneys office said in a statement.

Nearly three years of alleged drug trafficking came to a violent head in January or February 2018. Thats when Justin Animal Nelson of the Aryan Circle allegedly tried to sell $600 of meth to two Aryan Brotherhood of Texas members. A man described in the indictment as Victim A was supposed to be the go-between for the two groups. He gave Nelson the $600. But when Nelson didnt hand over the drugs, Victim A was forced to return to the Brotherhood empty handed.

Angry about  the missing money, members of the Brotherhood allegedly went to confront Nelson, who lied and told them Victim A had stolen the $600. Members of the Aryan Circle and the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas then allegedly kidnapped Victim A, pointing a pistol at his head and threatening to murder him. Nelson allegedly chopped off part of Victim As index finger with a hatchet, while a woman bashed Victim A in the back of the head with a blunt object, trying to knock him unconscious.

The white supremacists allegedly held Victim A hostage for days, and told Nelson to murder him at another location. Nelson, the real culprit behind the $600 swindle, appeared unable to go through with the murder, and eventually let Victim A escape.

The indictment accuses various members of the gangs with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, possession of controlled substances with intention to distribute, and possession of firearm by a felon, among other charges.

Other people accused in the indictment have their own sordid criminal histories. Joshua Lane, the first defendant in the complaint, was previously arrested on firearms charges in September, court records show. The second defendant, Craig Wheezy Wilbur, has a litany of drug offenses to his name and the third defendant, Maricella Segoviano, made headlines in 2014 when her then-boyfriend stole a car with two toddlers inside. Segoviano allegedly swiped the fathers wallet from the car.

When police arrested Lane again in November, he rammed police cars with his SUV, according to a criminal complaint. A police officer shot Lane once, believing him to be reaching for a gun in the SUV. After Lane was treated and transported to a jail, he had an ominous conversation with officers.

""Hopefully there won't be a next time,"" a police officer told him, according to a transcript included in the complaint. ""Stop getting into trouble.""

""Yeah,"" another officer said, ""you might not survive the next time.""

""You might not, either,"" Lane said."
2018-07-10,Daily Beast,Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Trumps Overly Dramatic Supreme Court Announcement,"Jimmy Kimmel taped his first show back from a July 4th break before President Donald Trump announced Judge Brett Kavanaugh as his second Supreme Court pick Monday night. But that didnt stop him from making fun of his over-the-top rollout.

Tonight was a bigly night for our Celebrity A-president, Kimmel said in his monologue, noting that the big show actually interrupted The Bachelorette on ABC, adding, Trump, as he has been known to do, announced his announcement multiple times on Twitter.

In response to one tweet in which Trump wrote he has long heard that choosing a Supreme Court justice is the most important decision a president can make, Kimmel said, I have long heard for Donald Trump means they said it this morning on Fox & Friends.

I dont know why he has to be so dramatic about this kind of thing, Kimmel added. No one needs more suspense. Just give us the name of your nominee so we can move on with our terrifying lives, OK?

With that, Kimmel cut to a clip of the announcement in which Trump defied all of the pundits and experts and chose as his Supreme Court pick... Lord Voldemort himself. That was actually a surprise, I will give you that."
2018-02-24,Daily Beast,The Real Red Velvet Cake Recipe,"As a lover of all kinds of desserts, I have to admit that I was late to join the red velvet cake appreciation society. Growing up in the northeast I dont remember ever seeing it in bakeries and it certainly wasnt a recipe that we made at home.

But several years ago, the crimson confection miraculously seemed to be everywhere and all that people could talk about. And with that explosion in popularity, suddenly all kinds of things were being passed off as red velvet cake, whether or not they had anything to do with the traditional recipe. If it was red on the inside and frosted white on the outside that was good enough.

So I was glad to discover that Kim Nelson, owner of mail-order bakery Daisy Cakes, is on a mission to set the record straight on what is and what is not red velvet cake. Im surprised by the number of people who say its just a chocolate cake with red food coloring in it, she writes in her new book, Daisy Cakes Bakes, which comes out on Tuesday. I always feel the need to let them know not where I come from! One tablespoon of cocoa does not a chocolate cake make. When that bit of cocoa combines with a touch of vinegar, a lovely reddish hue results. Adding food coloring amps up the wow factor!

Now that that issue is settled, please excuse me while I cut myself a generous slice of red velvet cake.

Vegetable shortening and flour for preparing the pans

Preheat the oven to 350F. Coat three 9-inch round cake pans with a thin layer of shortening with a light dusting of flour.

In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and baking powder.

In a small bowl, stir together the buttermilk, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat together the sugar and butter on high speed until fluffy, 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the eggs. Scrape down the sides and around the bottom of the bowl. Beat thoroughly on high speed until smooth, 2 minutes. Add the flour mixture and the buttermilk mixture. Beat on low speed just until combined. Scrape the bowl again. Beat on high speed for 1 minute. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.

Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake layer comes out clean, 18 minutes. The cakes will have pulled away from the edges of the pan, but the cakes edges shouldnt be browned. Let cool for 10 minutes before turning the layers out onto wire racks to cool completely.

Once cool, put one cake layer on a serving plate. Frost the top with the cream cheese frosting, then add a second cake layer and frost the top. Add the final cake layer and frost the top and sides.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until smooth, 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and around the bottom of the bowl. Add the cream cheese and vanilla and beat on high speed until smooth, 1 minute.

With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the confectioners sugar just until blended. Scrape down the bowl. Increase the speed to high and beat until smooth and fluffy, about 1 minute. The frosting will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.

This makes enough frosting for one 9-inch 4-layer cake or 24 cupcakes

2018-07-27,Daily Beast,Free Advice for Michael Cohen From Ex-Federal Prosecutors Shut Up,"As the feud between President Donald Trump and his former attorney and all-purpose fixer Michael Cohen continues to escalate publicly on a near-daily basis, its worth asking what prosecutors make of all this.  It is very unusual for a potential cooperating witness like Cohen to say anything at all publicly, never mind to get into a back-and-forth battle with the president of the United States, complete with innuendo, personal insults, and macho boasting going both ways.  If were sitting in the prosecutors chair on this one, our message to Cohen would be this:  Were interested, but you need to shut up.

During our careers as organized crime prosecutors with the Southern District of New York, the same office investigating Cohen, we dealt with dozens of cooperating witnesses.   Many of them were colorful, some of them were dangerous, and all of them took a lot of work.   It is vital to understand that cooperation, particularly in the SDNY, is a laborious process.   To start, both sides have to be interested.   The potential cooperator (here, Cohen) has to be willing to meet with prosecutors, admit all of his criminal conduct even if that involves dozens of crimes committed over many years  take a guilty plea, and testify as needed.   The cooperator also has to give information on all crimes that others committed; cooperators do not get to choose who they do and do not cooperate against.

The prosecution, on the other hand, has to believe that the potential cooperator has valuable information and is, or can become, a credible witness.   The benefit to the prosecution is that it now has an insider who can expose the inner workings of a closed organization, while the benefit to somebody like Cohen is that the prosecution will write a letter to the sentencing judge urging a reduction in sentence.   In the SDNY, prosecutors do not let any of the cooperators crimes slide, and do not guarantee the cooperator any particular sentence.

If both sides are interested, then the work begins.   Typically, the prosecutor and the cooperator will meet in a series of interview sessions, proffers, in which the cooperator tells the prosecutor everything he knows.   These proffers can take up days or even weeks, particularly with a cooperator who has a lot of how own baggage and a lot of dirt on others, like Cohen, presumably.

The most interesting meeting with a potential cooperator invariably is the first one.   Thats when the prosecutor gets to ask all the juiciest questions and see just how much the cooperator can deliver.   We used to feel slightly giddy when wed get a new mob cooperator in for the first round of questioning:   how many people did you kill, who else was in on those hits, etc.   But before you get to the good stuff, the prosecutor has to lay down some ground rules with the cooperator.   And rule number one should be the easiest to follow: shut up.   Anything you say you will say only to me and only in this proffer room.   You will not talk to anybody about this, including your friends and family.   (The notion of talking about potential cooperation publicly, or on Twitter, never even came up because it was unthinkable).

There are of course important reasons for this vow of silence.   Every time Cohen or his attorneys say something publicly, it gives Trump and his attorneys fodder to attack him in court, should there ever be a trial.

First, the defense attorneys will pick apart any of Cohens public statements for inconsistency with other things he may have said before, or with his trial testimony.   As one example, Cohens attorney claimed publicly that the recent leak that Trump knew in advance about the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian emissaries came not from Cohen but rather from the presidents camp.   If that turns out to be untrue, Cohen will pay the price on cross-examination.

Second, defense lawyers will attack Cohen for being biased and motivated by personal animus towards the president.   The first cross-examination question right out of the box should be, You dislike my client, dont you?   It would be tough for Cohen to wriggle out of that one given his (and his attorneys) recent public declarations against Trump.   Third, prosecutors need to keep the testimony of each witness independent from the testimony of every other witness.   By going public, Cohen may cloud or color the testimony of other potential witnesses, and, in the more extreme scenario, might enable other witnesses to tailor their testimony to match Cohens.   These outcomes are problematic for the prosecution and for the pursuit of justice.

It is entirely unclear what Cohen hopes to gain by going public.   Its not good for his cooperation prospects.   Some have speculated that he is trying to tempt the SDNY by showing them what he knows.   We dont buy it.   It is entirely unnecessary to do that publicly.   If Cohen has the goods, then set up a quiet meeting with the SDNY and give them a preview.   Cohens attorneys know that.   Another theory is that Cohen is somehow trying to solicit a pardon from the president.   We also dont see that one, at all.   The public feud seems certain only to further alienate the president.   And if Cohen has damaging information on Trump, then the best way to cozy up to the pardon-giver is by keeping quiet and waiting for the free pass

Our theory is perhaps the simplest one.   Weve got two guys, Cohen and Trump.   Theyre both true New Yorkers, theyve both got enormous egos, they both want the last word, and neither will ever back down from confrontation.   Its a good old-fashioned macho battle.   Thats it.   The problem is, this spat isnt helping anybody.   Most importantly, it is undermining Cohens ability to be a fully effective cooperator.   At a certain point, the SDNY might even just walk away if it goes too far.   But if Cohen and his attorneys can reign themselves in, then he could be one of the most consequential cooperating witnesses weve ever seen."
2018-05-14,Daily Beast,Cynthia Nixon Picks Up Major Endorsement From the Left,"Cynthia Nixon on Monday picked up a major endorsement from the left in her race against incumbent New York Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo.

The former Sex and the City star and longtime political activist won the official backing of Our Revolution, the political organization spun off from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) presidential campaign.

Cynthia Nixon is a lifelong progressive who has spent years working on educational equity. She is a bold progressive who is running in the spirit of Senator Bernie Sanders, Our Revolution head Nina Turner said in a statement. Cynthia is running to be a governor for the people, not for the billionaires and corporations who have held influence over New York's Democratic establishment for far too long.

Nixon responded to the endorsement praising the organization and the movement Sanders began in 2016: The activists, grassroots organizers, and leaders of Our Revolution are at the heart of the progressive movement in this country, and Im proud to join them in the fight to create a more democratic Democratic Party.

Our Revolution has notably gotten involved in Democratic primaries independent of Sanders.

For the recent Ohio Democratic gubernatorial primary, the group backed former Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who got trounced by Richard Cordray, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Sanders, however, remained mum on the contest.

The organization also recently endorsed Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed.

As for New York, Sanders previously declined to endorse in the primary but told The New York Times: Governor Cuomo has a strong record, he has done some very good things, obviously there are areas where I disagree with him. Cynthia seems to be generating a lot of grass-roots enthusiasm running on a progressive platform.

Nixons challenge from the left, coupled with her reliance on small-dollar contributions, has led to natural comparisons between her upstart candidacy and Sanders tough 2016 race against eventual Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

In addition to Our Revolution, Nixon was endorsed by influential liberal blog Daily Kos, The Working Families Party and Democracy for America, the progressive PAC founded by former Vermont Governor Howard Dean."
2018-07-13,Daily Beast,Roe v Wade Star Breaks Silence Anti-Abortion Film Is Like Lancing a Boil,"Filming of the stridently anti-abortion film Roe v. Wade has been roiled by its gruesome, dismembered-fetus-filled script, but actor Corbin Bernsen is sticking with the controversial production.

While the macabre details of some portions of the script sent the films original director, costumer, location scout, and once-committed actors like Kevin Sorbo and Stephen Baldwin running, the L.A. Law and Major League star likens the way he says the movie will relieve political tensions to lancing a boil.

We are a country that is festering right now, Bernsen said Thursday on the sidelines of a Roe v. Wade shoot at Washington, D.C.s Lincoln Memorial. We have a boil on the skin. And whats happening is were popping it. So the infection doesnt spread.

But Roe, the brainchild of conservative banking heir Nick Loeb, most famous for his ongoing court battleconveniently set in Louisiana, where the bulk of filming is taking placewith ex Sofia Vergara over their embryos, has repeatedly faced embarrassments and mishaps.

A crew member told The Daily Beast that the production has been withholding the extreme script from some cast and crew, and that morale has been very low on set: I dont think theres a single crew member that thinks, Oh, this is a great idea for a movie, its just being treated as another job, but nobody really wants to go to work the next day. Bernsen conceded that the production has been marred, because its a hot-button topic.

The project has had to operate under the alias 1973 at its Louisiana shooting locations to avoid controversy, and some crew members have complained about directorial bumbling by the replacement directors, Loeb and production partner Cathy Allynboth first-timers. On Thursday, before my interview with Bernsen, a Roe production intern stole my notepad and wouldnt give it back until police intervened. Bernsen, who witnessed the dust-up, told me the man snatched my notes because the movies been under great attack.

Sometimes we grab, sometimes we talk to you, Bernsen said.

While the Roe cast includes actors like Jon Voight, Steve Guttenberg, Jamie Kennedy and Stacy Dash, it also features conservative provocateurs Tomi Lahren, Milo Yiannopoulos and Roger Stone, the details of which were kept from some crew members.

Much of the controversy around Roe has focused on the gruesome script, which features Yiannopouloss character performing dozens of abortions in a few hours and a scene in a hotel room filled with a dozen buckets of tiny fetuses and baby parts.

Asked about the bloody scenes, Bernsen opts instead to praise a more palatable segment in the film where a sonogram is performed. Bernsen, who plays Roe opinion writer and Supreme Court justice Harry Blackmun (Lahren plays his daughter, Sally), said that hes requested changes of his own to the script, although he didnt specify what they are.

I would challenge this director, and Im looking at these directors, Bernsen said, turning to Loeb. What did I just tell you? Dont put that in the film the way its written, the way its there.

Bernsen has talked in the past about his own personal experience with abortion, describing his wife undergoing an abortion to terminate a nonviable pregnancy that threatened her own health as the worst day of his life. The 63-year-old actor also characterized himself Thursday as pro-abortion rights.

And while the Roe script presents a grisly portrayal of abortions, Bernsen points out that the movie faces a pressing issue with its more lurid scenes: the movie ratings board.

If you want to get a PG-rating, youre going to reach a greater audience, you cant put the stuff people are complaining about in the script, Bernsen said."
2018-09-14,Daily Beast,The Carolinas Ignored Warnings That Rising Sea Levels Would Make Hurricanes Stronger,"Eight years ago, a team of top scientists and engineers warned North Carolinas government that the state faced a potentially cataclysmic rise in sea levels that would bury billions of dollars in real estate under a meter of water.

Armed with this information, the Republicans in charge chose to bury their heads in sand instead.

Nearly a decade later, as Hurricane Florence makes landfall on the states Atlantic coast, the decision by North Carolina leaders to ignore that sea-level assessment are being criticized as a short-sighted bid to appease developerswhich may leave more than 300 miles of coastline exposed to the ravages of climate change.

Numerous state governmentsto say nothing of the current administrationhave scoffed at the notion of an anthropogenic factor in sea level rise and climate change. In neighboring South Carolina, where the states northeastern coast, including Myrtle Beach, is under a flash flood watch in anticipation of Florence dropping up to 25 inches of rain on the spring break resort town, Gov. Henry McMaster has supported President Donald Trumps decision to pull out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord last summer. McMaster joined both the states senators in dismissing concerns that increasingly violent hurricanes might result from warming ocean temperatures, and that rising sea levels might encroach on the states coastline.

Im with Trump, McMaster said at the time. Well be fine. Were getting better and better.

But even by the standards of modern climate-change denialism, North Carolinas rejection of climate science is mayor-from-Jaws-level exceptional.

In 2010, more than a dozen engineers and geoscientists working with the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commissions panel on coastal hazards released the North Carolina Sea-Level Rise Assessment Report, which was published with the goal of providing state planners and policymakers with a scientific assessment of the amount of sea-level rise likely to occur by the end of the century.

The results were dire. The scientists projected that climate change would lead to a likely sea-level rise of one meter, or 39 inches, by the year 2100, with the potential for sea-level rise of as much as 55 inches if the most extreme model proved accurate.

The study, the reports authors wrote, was based on undisputable [ sic ] evidence that sea level has been steadily rising in North Carolina, as well as multiple indicators suggesting that the global climate is warming. In dry science-speak, the panel concluded, an acceleration in the rate of [sea-level rise] is likely.

Addressing the reality of rising sea levels would require billions in infrastructure investment, from elevating roads and building sea walls around vital power and waste-treatment facilities to creating buffers intended to counter increasingly violent storm surgeslike those barrelling towards North Carolinas coast ahead of Hurricane Florence. It would also mean potentially abandoning highly valuable undeveloped coastline to the sea, an outcome that North Carolina real estate developers would not take sitting down.

Two years later, the states legislature passed H.B. 819, which effectively forbade the state from estimating future sea-level rise unless the rates were consistent with historic trends, ignoring the scientific consensus that sea-level rise is accelerating. Using exclusively historic models to predict future sea-level rise reduced that one-meter estimate to a mere eight inches of sea-level rise.

The bill, which became law without the governors signature, was widely mocked, including by South Carolina native son Stephen Colbert, who used the same principle of extrapolation to prove that he would never die. (Insurance actuaries be damned.) But the move was lauded at the time by NC-20, a group representing business interests in 20 coastal counties, as putting to an end the unscientific speculation that had infected the whole [sea-level rise] process.

The lead coastal scientist eventually quit the state panel in protest, declaring that the once highly respected and effective science panel has been subtly defrocked and is now an ineffective body.

In the years since, North Carolinas sea no evil policy has not stopped rising sea levels and climate change from negatively affecting its coastline.

Tidal flooding, also known as sunny day flooding, has become a major nuisance on the coast of the Carolinas. Fifty years ago, Charleston, South Carolina, saw four days of tidal flooding on average. In 2016, that number had risen to 50 days. In the same year, Wilmington, North Carolina, faced 84 days of high-tide flooding, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that 2017-2018 flooding will be 25 percent higher than averageand thats before Florence came calling.

Hurricane Florence itself represents one facet of the increasing calamity, according to researchers at Stony Brook University, who estimate that rainfall from the storm will be significantly increased by over 50% in the heaviest precipitating parts of the storm due to climate change, and that the storm is approximately 80 kilometers in diameter larger at landfall because of the human interference in the climate system.

Scientists estimateat their legal peril, in North Carolinathat the problems will keep getting worse. A report conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists last year found that as many as 20 communities in North Carolina could be completely lost to sea-level rise in the next 15 years.

These communities can cope with the water at first, said Erika Spanger-Siegfried, a senior climate analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists and lead author of the report. But there comes a threshold of sea-level rise-induced flooding that makes normal routines impossible and drives hard choices.

For coastal Carolinians trying to decide whether they can safely wait out the storm, however, the choice may have already been made for them."
2018-05-08,Daily Beast,When Your Abuser Is the States Top Law Enforcement Official,"Four women who have been in relationships with Eric Schneiderman, New Yorks top law enforcement official, recounted horrible experiences of abuse at his hands to The New Yorker. Barely three hours after their accounts were published, Schneiderman issued a statement of resignation.

The New Yorker story, Four Women Accuse New Yorks Attorney General of Physical Abuse, is about just what it sounds like: a man abusing women. Its not a story about which political party has the real monsters and hypocrites, as Kellyanne Conway was quick to imply in a tweet. Its not a story about who gets to step up now in New York politics, as the horse-race forecasters started discussing even before the calls from elected officials for Schneidermans resignation started coming in.

The story wasthough it should not have beenan opportunity for politicians to engage in virtue-signaling, sending out now-safe calls for a disgraced colleagues resignation in lieu of actually cleaning house, and turning in the known abusers who havent been publicly exposed yet.

Barely three hours passed before Schneiderman, denying the womens charges, announced he would resign, and people had already found time to hurl truly unhinged vitriol at one of the women brave enough to speak out against the top law enforcement official in her state, who once told her, I am the law, and vowed shed regret ever crossing him.

How much were you paid?

Thats one of the first tweets responding to Michelle Manning Barish sharing The New Yorker story in which she went public with abuse allegations against Schneiderman. In her tweet, Manning Barish wrote, After the most difficult month of my life-I spoke up. For my daughter and for all women. I could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me. I could not...

And amid dozens of tweets thanking her for her bravery is that one, accusing her of lying for money. Another wrote, SCREW YOU. SCREW YOUR DAUGHTER. Manning Barishs daughter is 9 years old. All that matters is to #impeachtrump, this Twitter user continued. Much bigger cause than your pride. #metoo my ass. Its our republic at stake here.

President Donald Trump is not part of The New Yorker story. Nor is Manning Barishs pride. Her wrist is:

Soon after she started dating Schneiderman, he told her to remove a small tattoo from her wrist; it wasnt appropriate, he said, if she were to become the wife of a politician. The process of having it removed was painful and expensive. In retrospect, she says, it was the first step in trying to control her body, the magazines Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow note.

And her ear, which bothered her for months, after Schneiderman allegedly slapped her across the face one night, before using the weight of his body against hers to hold her down and choke her. Blood trickled out of her ear months later, pooling in her collarbone, she said. She covered for Schneiderman, according to The New Yorker, and lied to an ear, nose, and throat doctor and said she injured herself with a Q-tip.

Mayer and Farrow go to lengths in their story of explaining why women stay with men like this, how this kind of abuse persists. As one of Schneidermans alleged victims points out, her options for legal recoursefiling an ethics complaint; bringing a civil suitwere inextricably intertwined with the attorney generals power. Now, in the typical haste with which politicians seem to love seizing womens pain for their own purposes, Conway wasted no time  promoting the story (Allegations are harrowing. Violence Against women. Drunk with power. Its so tough to read you must.)  and Gov. Andrew Cuomowho protects abusive men in his own employcalled for Schneidermans resignation and for a local district attorney to investigate the A.G. But Schneiderman was investigating Manhattan D.A. Cy Vance for not prosecuting Harvey Weinstein. Wheres the hero in this equation? Forget heroes, wheres the functioning legal process?

During her relationship with Schneiderman, Manning Barish said she lost so much weight, her hair started to fall out. Meanwhile, the attorney general squeezed her legs and called her chubby, she said. The top law enforcement official in the state, Schneiderman allegedly told Manning Barish, If you ever left me, Id kill you. When she made an oblique reference to him on social media, he allegedly called her and said, Dont ever write about me. You dont want to do that. The call reminded her of Schneiderman once telling her, I am the law. The words were uttered when she objected to being dragged across a street and reminded him, Jay-walking is against the law, according to the New Yorker report.

Manning Barish is one of four women to come forward with claims about Schneiderman. Two of the four are still too scared of the Democratic attorney general to go public with their names. One was advised by a number of friends to keep her experience to herself because Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose.

Its hard not to see party politics as an unfathomable scourge on society in these circumstances. Schneiderman is only a man, as much as he and his fans would like to think otherwise. He was not the last bulwark preventing the collapse of the republic. Hes a man who couldnt even stand up to Andrew Cuomo, another political figure who is just a man. Schneiderman is a man who works in Albany, where flagrant abuse has been a widespread issue for years, and he saw no evil. Hes a man who posted some tweets expressing solidarity with women and who sued Trump for a fraudulent university, which was a basic tenet of doing his job in New York State.

Hes also, as one of his victimized ex-girlfriends notes, the top law-enforcement official in the state. When he allegedly warned his victims he could tap their phones, have them followed, ruin their lives, they were not wrong to believe him. All of those things are within his grasp. This is a political story insofar as it is a story about a political figure allegedly using his political power as part of his abuse of women. It is a story about political stature weaponized for abuse.

Its hard not to recall the phone call published earlier this year by the  New York Post featuring former attorney general Eliot Spitzer threatening the life of an escort who says Spitzer choked her against her will. One wonders if there is something about this office that beckons to men who allegedly want to exert physical and emotional control over women. Or, for those inclined to make these stories about party politics, we can ask why the New York Democratic Party deems these men electable, holds them worthy of office. Its fair in New York to poke at the Tammany Hall-style machinery that propels men like this ahead. Its not fair, anywhere, to expect a woman to be silent for some unrealistic higher goal, like a man this flawed saving the republic. You cannot be a good guy and abuse people. Those two things are incompatible.

Like Spitzer before him, Schneiderman tried to claim that his alleged transgressions had nothing to do with his political office. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, Schneiderman wrote in his resignation statement, they will effectively prevent me from leading the offices work at this critical time. This is both true and not true. It is true that Schneidermans staffers are likely untainted by his alleged abuse of these women, that the work theyve done to root out fraud and corruption with cases like the one against Trump University or the investigation into Vance, is uncompromised. But Schneiderman allegedly used his political power to abuse these women. He allegedly tried to frighten them into silence by reminding them of the power he held, his power to harm them and get away with it. He is unfit for this office, and that is shown clearly in the way he allegedly treated these women."

2018-09-14,Daily Beast,Heres Why Citibank Should Have Been Allowed to Fail in 2008,"The financial crisis of 2008 is frequently attributed to problems with the banks, but Citibank was in far worse shape than its big-bank peers. Parent company Citigroup had a market value of $20 billion in early 2019 but was backed by more than $500 billion in taxpayer money through a long list of agencies and programs with names like TARP, TSLF, and FHLB.

Why in the world would the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and other regulators pump so much federal money into a company that even before the financial crisis was less than half the size of Microsoft, Walmart, AT&T, or Procter & Gamble? Why bail out Citibank at enormous cost instead of winding it down as the FDIC has done with thousands of banks over the last century?

If youre looking for the explanation for why America couldnt live without Citi, you wont find it, says James Freeman, an assistant editor on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal. There was a judgmentan instinctby the regulators to take that action, and well never get to run the other experiment. The more useful question to ask is, how we got into the situation.

Freeman and Vern McKinley, a George Washington University Law School visiting scholar, are co-authors of the new book Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts and Bailouts at Citi, a 206-year history of Citi that finds the bank strongest during the periods when the federal government wasnt providing it a financial backstop.

Freeman and McKinley sat down with The Daily Beast to talk about their conservative case for letting insolvent banksfrom the smallest community banks to the biggest national banksfail when they become insolvent.

When did City Bank with a Y become Citibank with an I?

Vern McKinley: In 1976, the company rebranded to Citibank. If you go all the way back to the beginning, it was City Bank, and then National City Bank, and then a few other names over the years. The new name was a modernization for a company that had been around since 1812.

How different does Citibank look today than it did in 1976?

McKinley: There have been a lot of technological changes since 1976. There were no ATMs then, and a credit card transaction involved somebody at the store making a telephone call to determine there was credit available for the transaction. That was at the very beginning of the automation on the consumer side of the bank.

One very interesting thing you note in the book is that banks were able to grow internationally before they were able to operate multiple branches in the United States. What was the reason for that?

James Freeman: The limits on branching go way back to an era when the bank was a single branch. Over time, the regulation of branching left open a greater possibility for branching overseas.

McKinley: Especially in New York, the banks didnt want the competition. I worked in Texas in the 80s, and there were a lot of institutions that failed in Texas during that time. The theory of allowing banks to have branches in many different areas was to diversify across those regional differences.

Big banks like Citibank and Bank of America were too big to fail in 2008, but theyre nowhere near the market value of companies like Apple and Amazon. What would you consider the best measure for how big is too big for a financial firm?

Freeman: We dont have an opinion on the size of banks. For roughly the last century, the banking business has been protected by Washington and has enjoyed various forms of government backstops. The problem with too big to fail wasnt that a particular-sized bank was problematic; it was the governments support and the perception among regulators that certain institutions are special and have to be protected from failure.

McKinley: A good example of that is JP Morgan. Money was leaving Citi and going to JP Morgan, which made it through the 2008 financial crisis with a strong balance sheet. Jamie Dimon, who was chairman of JP Morgan during the crisis, had previously been at Citi and may have been able to get Citi through the crisis had he not fallen out with Sandy Weill, who was running Citi at that time.

If regulators considered those banks too big to fail, though, the first part of that is that the banks were too big. Was Citi big enough to present a risk to the banking system and the economy if regulators had allowed it to fail?

Freeman: The book is a history of Citi through periods of stability and instability. What you see is that the bank was much stronger during periods when it did not have a federal backstop. What is the true source of systemic risk? Isnt it, in part, the governments support for a large bank? When we look at the bank in the second half of the 19th century, which at that time was called National City, it was a highly capitalized bank. It was an island of stability when other institutions were having trouble.

McKinley: You seem to be moving toward the idea that we should break up institutions when they get to be a certain size, but my question would be, who makes the decision? It would presumably be the Fed or the OCC or the FDIC, but how well positioned are they to make the call that a bank is too big? We show in the book that theyre not even very good at the job they have now, which is to supervise these institutions and monitor their risk.

During the 2008 financial crisis, Citi was in much worse shape than the other banks. Should the regulators have wound Citi down?

McKinley: If the question is whether Citi should have been allowed to fail, I think thats the case. The Fed and others make these arguments about system risk, but the records weve been able to get finds the reasoning to be wildly speculative about what would happen if one or more of these institutions had been allowed to fail.

Some of that depends on what fail means. Winding the company down would have been a much different outcome than Tim Geithners proposal to break off some of the failing parts into a bad bank and put in all new leadership at the good bank.

McKinley: Thats right. What we talk about in the book is the idea that a bridge bank would be under government control and get rid of the bad management, which the regulators did with IndyMac Bank during the crisis. The bridge bank worked in that case, but there was a question of whether it would have worked for a much larger bank like Citibank.

In a big economic downturn where a lot of companies suffered together, is there good evidence that TARP worked the way it was supposed to? The banks and automakers got immediately liquidity and paid it back over time when they got back on their feet?

Freeman: We focus on the earlier period because were trying to answer the question of how to avoid getting to the moment of crisis where there are very few options. One possible answer is to make clear over time that there wont be a safety net for these large organizations. When you look at the earlier age of Citibank from the Panic of 1837 until the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913, Citi was a strong, independent institution. Even as it becomes the largest bank in the country in the 1890s, it was a strong institution without a federal backstop with a lot of capital and every incentive in the world to manage its risks.

McKinley: And then it morphed into an institution that stumbles every 20 or 30 years and runs to the government for a bailout.

Is FDIC the main reason we dont have panicsbank runsanymore?

McKinley: We still have runs on banks. There was a run on Citi in 2008. There were runs on Wachovia and Washington Mutual. Many of those runs are by depositors who have money in those banks above the insured limit, but IndyMac Bank had a run that was largely FDIC insured deposits.

Do you think the Dodd-Frank Act makes it less likely that we would have a situation like 2008 again?

Freeman: I view it as largely a continuation of earlier policy. Dodd-Frank codified a lot of the policies used in the 2008 bailouts.

McKinley: In a crisis, the regulatory framework gets thrown out the window. In 2008, you had TARP that bailed out the banks and the Federal Housing Finance Agency bailing out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When you have a crisis, you get ill-advised new laws that codify the bailouts, so the history is that the regulators will change the rules mid-crisis to facilitate a bailout despite what Dodd-Frank says.

The Dodd-Frank Act, at the least, gives the regulators a mechanism to wind a bank down. Should the banks should view that as at least a warning shot?

Freeman: We had a codified mechanism in 2008 to wind down Citi, and Sheila Bair at the FDIC wanted to take a look at winding down Citi. The response from Tim Geithner [then head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York] and Hank Paulson [then Treasury Secretary] was that shutting down Citi wasnt an option. They had the tools to wind down Citi then.

Which goes back to the question of system risk. Would shutting Citi down have been a bigger hit to the economy than bailing it out?

McKinley: There was a lot of overblown rhetoric that peoples cards wouldnt work at the ATMs and the country would grind to a halt like Egypt, and there wasnt a lot of rational analysis behind that. That rhetoric was mostly in support of going ahead with bailing out the banks.

In the 70s, regulators wound down a bank called Franklin National. Why do you characterize that in the book as a bailout?

McKinley: Some of the uninsured depositors were not made whole on their FDIC insurance, and the FDIC ended up taking the hit in that case.

And you think the better public policy would have been to wipe out those depositors above what the FDIC insured?

Freeman: Youre not wiping them out. If the government fulfills its guarantee to depositors and does nothing more, thats not wiping them out. A big part of the too big to fail problem is the expectation and the reality that the governmentat its discretion and especially for large institutionswill go beyond its obligations to protect depositors.

McKinley: It creates a lot of uncertainty. A lot of the problems in 2008 were caused by the uncertainty in the market. If Im a bank creditor, will I get bailed out? Do I get bailed out only if Im a creditor of certain banks? There was uncertainty about what the regulators would actually do.

Would you like to see commercial banks and investment banks separated again like they were for much of the 20th century?

Freeman: That depends a lot on what the problem is that you want to solve. The problems at Citi were not limited to its investment bank or trading of particular financial instruments. The problems can come from areas other than the capital markets; they can come from foreign lending, commercial lending, real-estate lending. Commercial banks that are not well-capitalized can get themselves into trouble whether or not they have an investment bank.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren would say that they should be regulated for what they are. Commercial banks borrow money at the Fed window, lend it to businesses and make money on the difference. Investment banks do a very different thing.

McKinley: She shakes her fist at the investment banks and characterizes them as casinos, but the history of commercial banks over the last hundred year are that they arent very stable either.

But you can at least insure the deposits in the commercial banks and put everyone else on notice that theyre on their own.

Freeman: If that happened, they system might work better. Unfortunately, that gets extended in moments of crisis or moments of perceived crisis. This is the problem of too big to fail. Regulators are not willing to let investors suffer the consequences of the banks bad decisions. The explicit promise of the law may be only as to insured deposits, but that certainly got stretched much further in 2008.

McKinley: Citi has shown time and time again that regardless of whether theyre connected with an investment bank or not, theyre going to get in trouble one way or the other."
2018-10-25,Daily Beast,Caravan of Lies Intensifies as Trump and the GOP Round Third,"President Trump, who announced this week that hes a nationalist as if it were in doubt, knows one true thing: The biggest lies are at once the most likely to seduce and least requiring of proof.

His biggest amid a flood of them is that the caravan of Central Americans fleeing their lawless countries is the work of Democrats, or as he refers to them, the mob. Whats more those bad people seeking legal asylum include Middle Easterners and MS-13 members.

If you think this is just one more among the more than 4,000 documented falsehoods that can be shrugged off as Trump being Trump, look at where we are. Investigations are to come but after Trumps latest incitements, including his praise of a candidate who body-slammed a reporter last year to the approving roar of the crowd, a spate of bombs has shown up across the country.

A sophisticated one was found in the mailbox of billionaire George Soros, whom the right considers the go-to funder for progressive causes like the caravan. A suspicious package showed up at the Clintons home in Chappaqua. A pipe bomb with wires was found at CNN addressed to former CIA director John Brennan whose security clearance Trump took away.

The migrants we are to fearto Trump, a brown wave invading Texas he hopes will stem a blue wavewere a small group that banded together for protection on a trek north without the thieving coyotes who leave them to die in the desert after being paid thousands of dollars.

The group grew after a cable channel aligned with the corrupt government, concerned about the message a mass exodus was conveying, made up a story that a former state legislator was inciting them with food and protection. Not true, but true enough to encourage many whod been desperate but afraid to flee their lawless countries, where 90 percent of violent crimes go unpunished, to join up, seeking safety in numbers.

The war on the caravan is partly to divert attention from how Trumps cruel measures did nothing to stem the mass exodus. In blasting the caravan, Trump has given up any worry of being overtly racist. Does anyone think if a group of fearful citizens from Saskatchewan were gathered at the Canadian border seeking asylum, Trump would be demonizing them?

Maybe if they claimed to be escaping the tyranny of Justin Trudeau, who refuses to kiss the presidents ring. While he rejected David Dukes endorsement during the campaign, Trump said nothing when Duke praise him for pronouncing himself a proud nationalist this week.

Following Trumps lead, many campaigns feature overt racism. Rep. Duncan Hunter (D-CA), indicted on corruption charges he blames on his wife, calls his Arab-American opponent a security risk, while another indicted Republican, Rep. Chris Collins, shows his opponent speaking Korean to say he favors that country over our own.

Against black candidates, white Republicans are running ads that would make Lee Atwater of Willie Horton fame blush. Theyve shown a black hand covering a white womans mouth in Dallas, called a black candidate in upstate New York a big city rapper, and in Florida, former congressman Ron DeSantis urged voters not to elect Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and monkey this up. He defended the slur as a figure of speech.

Although the White House went into overdrive trying to justify Trumps fiction about the caravan, the best they could do was to deploy the most servile vice president in modern history to say that it was inconceivable that there wasnt a Muslim in the group. Midweek, having shot his lies into the bloodstream, Trump said that because no one could disprove what he was saying, it had to be true.

Lying about the caravan is the most serious in a series of lies broadcast this campaign. Seeing that the public is upset over Republicans effort to take away coverage for their kids asthma or their own cancer, Trump is accusing Democrats of trying to kill coverage for pre-existing conditions when in fact doing that is the most fervent desire of Trump, the congressional majority, and candidates like Florida Gov. Rick Scott (running to unseat Sen. Bill Nelson) and Missouris Attorney General Josh Hawley (challenging Sen. Claire McCaskill). Scott and Hawley have spent hundreds of thousands on ads pretending they havent sued the federal government to end coverage, Hawley going so far as to use his own son with a pre-existing condition as proof.

As for the lying tax cut for the middle class before Election Day, it would only take a not very smart fifth-grader to see through it. No ones campaigning on the first tax bill, it was such a bust for the non-wealthy. Trump boasted to his Mar-a-Lago crowd that theyd all just got a lot richer, from it in 2017.

Theres no chance hes going to fix that. In keeping with Trumps turning his party into a bunch of lying liars to protect him, the formerly truthful chair of House Ways and Means Kevin Brady gave a thumbs-up when called upon to endorse Trumps assertion at a Houston rally fully aware the out-of-session Congress couldnt make it happen. At best, Trump could issue a meaningless resolution that maybe someday, somehow, could lead to legislation. Dont hold your breath.

But breathe in deeply the truth telling lately from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who promised that if voters keep his majority, he will kill whats left of Obamacare, and slash Medicare and Social Security to fix the deficit engorged by the current majoritys profligate spending.

Its hard for Democrats to keep up with Trumps false claims, especially on the caravan. Their efforts are immediately rebuffed as being soft on gangs, desirous of open borders, and driven by an incurable case of excess compassion. No one hears that theyve been begging Trump to advance an immigration reform bill that passed the Senate with 63 votes before he took office.

Trump prefers the crowd-pleasing issue. How the vote goes may come down to whether you are more sickened by a caravan of those struggling to be free of tyranny, as Trump is, or by the pictures of caged and incarcerated children. Its hard to believe theres a contest."
2018-11-09,Daily Beast,Inside the Crazy Corruption Scandal That Ensnared Leonardo DiCaprio and the Hollywood Elite,"The Wolf of Wall Street is the story of Jordan Belfort, a New York City stockbroker who, during the late 1980s and 1990s, committed rampant fraud through his brokerage house Stratton Oakmont. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, its one of the best films of both this decade and the illustrious auteurs career, a hilarious and shocking black comedy about the limitless depths of human greed and the insane corruption that dominates the American financial sector.

And in a twist of jaw-dropping irony, the film itself is an example of the very wretched thing it depicts.

Premiering at DOC NYC on Friday, November 9, Sam Hobkinsons The Kleptocrats is an eye-opening peek at the global embezzlement and money-laundering scandal that helped give birth to The Wolf of Wall Street. Its a true-life tale of leaders putting themselves above their constituents, of wannabe big shots reveling in their astounding ill-gotten gains, and of investigative journalists driven to bring covert crimes to light. Moreover, its a snapshot of the shadier side of stratospheric celebrity life, given that it involves not only DiCaprio and Scorsese, but also the likes of Paris Hilton, Kanye West, Jamie Foxx and Robert De Nirothe last of whom, at one point, responds to pointed questions from The Hollywood Reporters Alex Ritman by telling him, Yeah, well, I dont fucking appreciate it, excuse me. Get the fuck outta here. Goodbye.

De Niros frustration stems from the fact that, like many others, he found himself embroiled in this international saga of intrigue thanks to his connection to Jho Low, a Malaysian playboy who once threw himself a birthday bash (attended by the aforementioned A-listers, plus Bradley Cooper, Pharrell Williams, Zach Galifianakis and Kim Kardashian) that none other than Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous Robin Leach now proclaims, The best and the most expensive party that Las Vegas has ever seen. Low was an NYC club favorite thanks to his penchant for buying magnums of Cristal like they were bottles of Poland Spring. Before long, he came into the orbit of DiCaprio, Hilton and other Hollywood luminaries via Red Granite Pictures, an upstart production outfit that rocked the industry with a lavish 2011 Cannes Film Festival shindig, and soon opted to back Scorseses The Wolf of Wall Streeteven though, as trade journalists confess, no one knew the origins of their considerable cash.

That would soon cease to be the case. In 2013, The New York Times Louise Story began looking into illicit money being used to purchase Manhattan real estate (including NYCs swanky Time Warner Center) through shell companies, and one of those firms was owned by Riza Azizone of the founders of Red Granite Pictures. Aziz and partner Joey McFarlane had no reason to be this flush with dough, and inquiries soon led Story to Low, whom she spotted at the Wolf of Wall Street L.A. premiere after-party. More digging revealed that Low was trying to buy a Time Warner Center penthouse (which DiCaprio had stayed in during production). And according to sources, he claimed he was doing so on behalf of Najib Razak, the then-Prime Minister of Malaysia.

As The Kleptocrats explicates with concision, lucidity and an excited can-you-believe-this sense of outrage, Low and Razak were cohorts in an elaborate conspiracy to enrich themselves by defrauding the Malaysian people. In 2009, Razak established 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Berhad), a trust fund subsidized by the nations taxpayers that was designed to bring healthy returns to those very same people. Yet it soon became clearthrough the efforts of journalists from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as well as Malaysian opposition politicians such as Tony Puathat 1MDB wasnt helping anyone but Razak himself. With Low managing the fund, the prime minister used 1MDB as his personal piggybank, going so far as to pilfer its coffers to purchase a $27 million diamond necklace for his materialistic wife Rosmah (The Imelda Marcos of Malaysia).

He also used it to funnel money to Red Granite to fund The Wolf of Wall Street.

While Red Granite denies knowing that its cash came from illicit sources, The Kleptocratsemploying black-text-on-yellow-background title cards that echo the style of Scorseses filmis a damning indictment of the firm, Low, Razak and 1MDB. White-collar criminality doesnt come much more brazen, or avaricious, than this, and director Hobkinson exposes it via multiple reportorial and activist perspectives, the better to hammer home not only the extent of this disgusting activity, but the negative impact it had on Malaysians. Even Razaks brother Nazir partakes in this takedown, speaking about his brothers initial desire to follow in their prime-minister fathers footsteps, and his own shock and horror at discovering that his sibling had instead opted to exploit his peoples trust in order to live in the lap of luxury.

Malaysias political corruption is clearly the big story here. Nonetheless, the juiciest moments in The Kleptocrats concern its American showbiz players, who apparently were attracted to Low like moths to a flame. Seeing them perform on stage at his gatherings, or chug champagne with him while he commandeers a microphone in front of screaming crowds, is to see the grossness of celebrity excess and indulgence laid bare. Many of these stars, of course, were simply around Low because he threw a great party. But in the revelation that DiCaprio spent significant time with Low (and even received a Picasso painting from him), and that Miranda Kerr accepted thousands of dollars of jewelry from him when they briefly dated, Hobkinsons doc suggests that the super-elite are comfortable with just about anythingor, at least, are fine with not asking questions about their wealthy pals so long as it benefits them.

According to The Kleptocrats, DiCaprio and Kerr do plan on returning all those gifts, and in 2018, Razak was voted out of office, thus ending his partys six-decade rule. Thats only partial consolation for the Malaysian people, however, whove yet to receive any restitution from The Wolf of Wall Street, which earned $392 million globally thanks to the money-laundering financing of its own Jordan Belfort-ish creep, Jho Low (whos personally thanked in its credits!).

No wonder Pua says that, when it comes to Scorseses movie, It appears that they are laughing at Malaysians."
2018-06-13,Daily Beast,How America Got Hooked on the Deadly Drug OxyContin,"Purdue Pharma left almost nothing to chance in its whirlwind marketing of its new painkiller OxyContin.

From 1996 to 2002, Purdue pursued nearly every avenue in the drug supply and prescription sales chaina strategy now cast as reckless and illegal in more than 1,500 federal civil lawsuits from communities in Florida to Wisconsin to California that allege the drug has fueled a national epidemic of addiction.

Kaiser Health News is releasing years of Purdues internal budget documents and other records to offer readers a chance to evaluate how the privately held Connecticut company spent hundreds of millions of dollars to launch and promote the drug, a trove of information made publicly available here for the first time.

All of these internal Purdue records were obtained from a Florida attorney generals office investigation of Purdues sales efforts that ended late in 2002.

I have had copies of those records in my basement for years. I was a reporter at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, which, along with the Orlando Sentinel, won a court battle to force the attorney general to release the company files in 2003. At the time, the Sun-Sentinel was writing extensively about a growing tide of deaths from prescription drugs such as OxyContin. We drew on the marketing files to write two articles, including one that exposed possible deceptive marketing of the drug. Now, given the disastrous arc of prescription drug abuse over the past decade and the stream of suits being filedmore than a dozen on some daysit seemed time for me to share these seminal documents that reveal the breadth and detail of Purdues efforts.

Asked by Kaiser Health News for comment on the OxyContin marketing files and the suits against the company, Purdue Pharma spokesman Robert Josephson issued a statement that reads in part:

Suggesting activities that last occurred more than 16 years ago, for which the company accepted responsibility, helped contribute to todays complex and multi-faceted opioid crisis is deeply flawed. The bulk of opioid prescriptions are not, and have never been, for OxyContin, which represents less than 2% of current opioid prescriptions.

The marketing files show that about 75 percent of more than $400 million in promotional spending occurred after the start of 2000, the year Purdue officials told Congress they learned of growing OxyContin abuse and drug-related deaths from media reports and regulators. These internal Purdue marketing records show the drugmaker financed activities across nearly every quarter of medicine, from awarding grants to health care groups that set standards for opioid use to reminding reluctant pharmacists how they could profit from stocking OxyContin pills on their shelves.

Purdue bought more than $18 million worth of advertising in major medical journals that cheerily touted OxyContin. Some of the ads, federal officials said in 2003, grossly overstated the drugs safety.

The Purdue records show that the company poured more than $8 million into a website and venture called Partners Against Pain, which helped connect patients to doctors willing to treat their pain, presumably with OxyContin or other opioids.

It made and distributed 14,000 copies of a video that claimed opioids caused addiction in fewer than 1 percent of patients, a claim Food and Drug Administration officials later said has not been substantiated.

Purdue hoped to grow into one of the nations top 10 drug companies, both in sales and image or professional standing, according to the documents; OxyContin was the means to that end.

Purdue first marketed the drug for cancer pain, but planned to expand that use to meet its multimillion-dollar sales goals. In 1998, the market for treating cancer with opioids stood at $261 million, compared with $1.3 billion for treating other types of pain, the Purdue reports note.

Purdues OxyContin sales objectives were clearly stated in the earliest marketing plan in the records, for 1996. It sought $25 million in sales and to generate 205,000 prescriptions. By the next year, its goals had tripled: $77.9 million in sales and to generate 600,000 prescriptions.

Purdue bombarded doctors and other health workers with literature and sales calls. Records show that in 1997 the company budgeted $300,000 for mailings to doctors who prescribed opioids liberally, based on sales data that drug companies purchase. The mailers recommended OxyContin for pain syndromes, including osteoarthritis and back pain. It added $75,000 for mailings to keep in touch with our best customers for OxyContin to ensure they continue prescribing it.

Sales agents made thousands of visits to general practice doctors and others who had little training or experience using potent opioids, according to a 2003 Government Accountability Office audit. The OxyContin slogan in 1999 was: The One to Start With and the One to Stay With. OxyContin earned Purdue about $2.8 billion in revenue from the start of 1996 through June 2001, according to the Justice Department.

In May 2000, Purdues hope to conquer the arthritis market hit a snag when the FDA criticized an ad for OxyContin in the New England Journal of Medicine. The FDA said the ad, which Purdue Pharma agreed to stop using, overstated the drugs benefits for treating all types of arthritis without pointing out risks.

News reports of abuse and overdose deaths also were surfacing. Purdues 2001 marketing document noted that OxyContin had experienced significant challenges the year before because of abuse and unlawful diversion in Maine, Ohio, Virginia, Louisiana, and Florida. OxyContin pills contain oxycodone, an opioid as potent as morphine and maybe more so. Abusers quickly figured out they could crush the pills and snort or inject the dust.

In response, Purdues 2001 marketing budget included funding to help doctors recognize patients who were in need of substance abuse counseling and do more to prevent abuse and diversion. It added $1.2 million in spending for what it called anti-diversion efforts in 2002, according to the internal records.

In 2002, the Florida attorney generals office was one of the first law enforcement agencies to investigate Purdue. The state ended its probe after Purdue agreed to pay Florida $2 million to help fund a data system to monitor narcotics prescriptions. It did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement.

Yet handwritten notes of a state investigators interview with a former Purdue sales manager for West Virginia and western Pennsylvania named Bill Gergely, then 58, suggested otherwise. The notes were part of the documents released by the state.

Gergely, who worked for the company from 1972 until 2000, said Purdue executives told sales staff at a launch meeting that OxyContin was non-habit forming, according to the undated investigators notes. Gergely said Purdue gave its sales force materialsome of which was not approved by the FDAfor education, the notes show. He told the investigator that Purdue had a bonus system and paid well; the last year he worked for Purdue, Gergely earned $238,000.

As Purdue charged ahead with OxyContin, prescription pills overtook illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine as killers in Florida, according to medical examiner files. In May 2002, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel documented nearly 400 pill deaths in three South Florida counties the previous two years, based on an examination of autopsy and police records.

Half the deaths involved drugs that contained oxycodone, according to medical examiner records. But it was not always clear in these records that it was OxyContin because oxycodone was an ingredient in many other narcotic pills. In 70 of the deaths, however, police or medical examiner records specifically identified OxyContin as one of the drugs. Though some people who died bought pills on a thriving black market, many were under the care of doctors for what appeared, at least at some point, to be legitimate injuries, according to medical examiner files.

Purdue did not challenge the accuracy of the newspapers reporting. It countered that the articles did a disservice to the company and patients who take their medicine according to the directions of their doctors. While the company said its executives deeply regret the tragic consequences that have resulted from the misuse and abuse of our pain medicine... advances in the treatment of pain should not be limited or reversed because some people illegally divert, abuse or misuse these drugs.

To its sales force, the internal Purdue records show, Purdue blamed bad press for cutting into sales. The medias attention to abuse and diversion of OxyContin tablets has provided state Medicaid plans and some HMOs, concerned about the effect the product is having on their budget, an excuse to look for ways to limit the prescribing of OxyContin tablets, the 2002 marketing document said.

But five years after its legal battle with Florida officials, Purdue made a startling admission in federal court in Virginia. The company pleaded guilty in 2007 to felony charges of misbranding OxyContin with the intent to defraud or mislead. The company paid $600 million in fines and other penalties. Among the deceptions it confessed to was directing its salespeople to tell doctors the drug was less addictive than other opioids.

Three Purdue Pharma executives pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal charges for their roles in the marketing scheme. The three men paid a total of $34 million in fines and penalties, court records show. Accepting Purdues plea deal, U.S. District Judge James P. Jones noted that federal prosecutors believed the Purdue case of 2007 would send a strong deterrent message to the pharmaceutical industry.

Ten years on, the 1,500-plus lawsuits, filed mostly on behalf of cities, counties and states, could prove to be a costly reckoning for the opioid industry. The suits are demanding payback from Purdue and other drugmakers for the sky-high costs of treating addiction and other compensation, much as the litigation against Big Tobacco in the late 1990s.

Other drug makers named as defendants in most of the suits include those that Purdue considered to be its top competitors in the pain sector: Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Endo International PLC and Mallinckrodt PLC.

Federal officials estimate the economic cost of opioid abuse topped $500 billion in 2015 alone. Since 1999, at least 200,000 people have died in the U.S. from these overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 52,000 of those died in 2015 alone, more than were killed in car crashes and gun homicides combined, the suits contend.

A case filed in April by Baltimore County in Maryland makes an argument common to many of the suits:

From the mid-90s to the present, manufacturing defendants aggressively marketed and falsely promoted liberal opioid prescribing as presenting little to no risk of addiction, even when used long term for chronic pain. They infiltrated academic medicine and regulatory agencies to convince doctors that treating chronic pain with long-term opioids was evidence-based medicine when, in fact, it was not.

Huge profits resulted from these effortsas did the present addiction and overdose crisis.

Purdue has not yet filed a response to the allegations in the suit.

Other drug manufacturers emulated Purdues false marketing strategy and sold billions of dollars of prescription opioids as safe and efficacious for long term use, knowing full well that they were not, Wisconsins Oneida County alleges in its November 2017 federal court suit. Purdue also has not yet filed a response to the allegations in this suit.

But Purdue spokesman Josephson told KHN: We share public officials concern about the opioid crisis, and we are committed to working collaboratively toward meaningful solutions. We vigorously deny these allegations and look forward to the opportunity to present our defense.

One California doctor who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for overprescribing OxyContin is also suing Purdue. Masoud Bamdad alleges that the companys representatives made sales calls and gave him deceitful, misleading and over-hyped information, which he relied on to prescribe the drug, in some cases with deadly consequences for his patients, according to the suit, which is pending. Purdue has asked that the case be stayed while judges decide if it should be consolidated with others filed against the company. In February, Purdue announced that it would no longer promote opioids to doctors.

Because the lawsuits from across the U.S. contain similar allegations, many of them have been consolidated in Ohioas a multi-district litigation. Some days, federal court dockets log a dozen or more new cases. Many of the suits run a hundred pages or more and allege that deceptive opioid marketing schemes continue to this day.

The manufacturers, in a joint court motion late last year, contend that opioids serve a critical public health role in providing relief to patients suffering from pain that is often debilitating and that they are being wrongly blamed.

They also point out that the FDA approved all of their products as safe and effective.

This month, the manufacturers filed motions to dismiss several of the cases, arguing that the county governments lack a legal basis for their claims. In seeking to blame the drugmakers, these lawsuits ignore the criminal acts of third parties, the crucial role of health care providers, and the thorny public policy questions surrounding the problem of opioid abuse, reads a motion to dismiss a case filed by Monroe County, Mich., against Purdue Pharma and other drug companies.

Dan Polster, the federal judge handling the cases, told an overflow crowd in his courtroom that the opioid epidemic has become so severe, that it is cutting the average life expectancy of Americans.

Im pretty ashamed that this has occurred while I have been around, he said in January, adding I think we all should be.

2018-03-14,Daily Beast,PA-18 Message to GOP Its Time to Dump Trump,"In the olden days, coal miners would carry caged canaries down into the mines to test for carbon monoxide . The idea was to detect a problem before it harmed humans.

This might serve as a useful metaphor for Republicans who still dont know yet whether they won or lost a special election in coal country, but in which their candidate trailed by a few hundred votes Wednesday morning. The canary in the coal mine is on life-support. Its time to get out while you can.

Democrat Conor Lambs strong showing against Republican Rick Saccone in Pennsylvanias 18 th district is all the evidence you need to see the danger of being in the same party as Donald Trump on the mid-term ballot in November.

Why is this race such a dire warning sign? Its not just because (a) Republicans spent a lot of money, or because (b) Trump visited the district as recently as Saturday, or because (c) Trump announced popular steel tariffs just before this election. Nor is it because (d) this district (that Trump won by 20 points!) should be favorable for Republicans (The other day, The Daily Beasts Michael Tomasky did a terrific job of demonstrating that).

No, its because Pennsylvania-18 serves as one more data pointone more cautionary taleabout a much larger national trend. There are literally dozens of congressional districts that are more competitive than this one.

Whether youre looking at a race like Virginias 2017 gubernatorial election or the Doug Jones recent upset in Alabama, the trend of Democratic enthusiasm is hard to deny. And in mid-term elections, enthusiasm is the thing to watch for.

Of course, compared to a presidential year voter turnout for special elections decreases on both sides. But since Trump won the presidency in November of 2016, in states as diverse as Kansas, South Carolina, Montana, and Georgia, Republican turnout has dropped precipitously compared to turnout in congressional races when Trump and Clinton were on the ballot.

As columnist Bill Scher noted after the recent Alabama special election where Democrat Doug Jones bested Republican Roy Moore,  Compared with the 2016 presidential results, the Republican vote plummeted by 51 percent, while the Democratic vote ticked down by just 8 percent.

Now, the truth is that its hard to compare what happened on Tuesday in PA-18 with what happened in November of 2016 because the long-time incumbent GOP Congressman, Tim Murphy, ran unopposed. Still, its clear now that Pennsylvania is the latestand arguably, one of the most obviousexamples of this pattern.

To be sure, each race is unique, and campaigns do matter. The quality of the political candidates matter, too. Its fair to say that in Pennsylvania, Democrats had a good candidate (not only was Lamb competent, but his moderate politics fit the district)and Republicans didnt.

Speaking of the importance of smart campaigns, an interesting aside is in order: Joe Trippi, who was Doug Jones top political advisor, was recently on my podcast. Trippi said that Trumps visit to Pensacola, Florida, on the Friday before Election Day, gave Republican Roy Moore four-point boost. But it didnt last. Jones internal tracking polls showed that it dissipated each day, and by Tuesday, Jones was ahead. What does this have to do with Pennsylvania? Donald Trump visited the district on Saturday night.

Maybe Trump should have traveled to the district on Monday instead?

Regardless, even if Saccone wins, it doesnt change the trajectory of what is clearly becoming a horrible political environment for Republicans.

We have reached the break glass in case of emergency moment. The message is clear: Republicans must do whatever they have to do to survive the 2018 mid-term elections.

For many Republicans, step one will be to separate from Trumpand his abysmal approval ratings. Republican leadership, such as it exists, should cut them loose. What this means is that they should vote with the district, not with the party. And they shouldnt feel compelled to defend the indefensible. In other words, be with Trump if and when it makes sense in your district, but dont do so out of obligation. Localize the race as much as possible. Hugging Trump doesnt seem to work. To the degree he is popular, it isnt transferableand it certainly isnt driving turnout.

As conservative commentator Quin Hillyer noted,  Trump endorsed Luther Strange. Strange lost. Trump endorsed Roy Moore. Moore lost. Trump endorsed Saccone, who appears to have lost. in 2016, Trump endorsed Renee Ellmers. Ellmers lost....

Loyalty schmoyalty. Distance yourselves. Save yourselves. Its every man for himself. Pennsylvania-18 is the canary in the coal mine. And theres toxic gas flooding in!"
2018-05-30,Daily Beast,Jimmy Kimmel Roasts ABC for Canceling Roseanne This Was a Huge Blow,"Earlier this month, Jimmy Kimmel was making fun of Roseanne Barrs outsized influence over his network at ABCs upfront presentation.

Were saying goodbye to Shondaland and were going headfirst into Roseanne-istan, Kimmel joked at the time, adding, Our new strategy is resurrecting old crap. I have three words for you: Whos the Boss? Literally, who the hell is running this place?

Two weeks later, Roseanne has been cancelled after its creator and star tweeted a racist attack on former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett (and an anti-Semitic one aimed at George Soros).

As ABCs resident late-night host, Kimmel couldnt exactly avoid the biggest story of the day in his monologue Tuesday night. But he didnt dwell on it either.

Youre not going to believe this but she tweeted something outrageous, Kimmel said of the tweet that led ABC to give Roseanne Barr the boot. ABC today decided to cancel their highest-rated show, Roseanne, following a tweet in which Roseanne compared an African-American woman, a former advisor to President Obama, to an ape, he added. Which did not sit well with ABC managementor anyone with a brain, really.

Kimmel joked that the move was a huge blow to ABC because we dont have much on this network. He added, Roseanne was a very bigly hit for ABC and we needed it.

From there, the host argued that just because Roseanne Barr is out doesnt mean Roseanne cant continue on without her. The show must go on, he said before presenting the trailer for Dan, starring John Goodman."
2018-11-21,Daily Beast,Affordable Gifts That Only Look Expensive,"Im not sure when or how I became the queen of finding affordable items that only look like a fortune. Maybe its because my mom trained me from a young age to run straight to the sale rack when I enter a store, or maybe because I simply enjoy being perceived as someone who has expensive taste in order to fill some deep dark void within, which is very healthy and normal, I swear.

When it comes to gifting, no one will ever tell you that, while its the thought that counts, its how much you paid for it that hints at your devotion, too. Even if you dont necessarily make it rain, heres how to shower your loved ones with top-quality items you can actually afford.

I was very upset when my betrothed gifted this Kate Spade ring holder/trinket bowl to me because I assumed he paid a ton for it. Sterling silver with a pretty little bow on it, its a steal at $40.

A study I just made up suggests that carrying your business cards in a structured case rather than scattering them around your briefcase like Hansel and Gretel trails of loose bread makes you look 300 times more professional. Here, take my card, said every CEO about to close a massive deal ever.

Frida Kahlo is a symbol of all things strength and class, rendering the mere idea of her luxurious. Place her in a rainforest smoking a cigarette, and now were talking. Whats great about a serving tray is that when its not in use, it works as a coffee table centerpiece or a decorative item you can lean against the backsplash in your kitchen.

You dont need to spend a ton on cufflinks to look instantly pulled together. Even just a flash of gunmetal and a versatile, deep hue in a minimalist setting ups the dapper factor infinitely. Skip the pineapples and motorcycles (seriously, who signs off on these designs?) and spend less to look better.

Crystals and Jean Paul Gaultier? This designer power duo knows a thing or six about ear candy with its dainty dangling chain and that hooks onto your cartilage. Theres no doubt this gem of a piece will leave people speechless at how much you paid for it.

Given the cost of healthcare and several hours lost to aimlessly browsing the vitamin aisle, this nifty device is an absolute steal. Start with a self-administered blood test (its not as scary as it sounds), and from there, get a four-week supply of customized vitamins tailored to your specific needs. And yes, real, live human nutritionists and dietitians cross-check your order to ensure safety.

The same way tall folks are perceived as more important (begrudgingly types the 52 author of this piece) so too do tall items appear more expensive, probably. The vase is essentially perched up on high heels for plants, and looks stunning while doing it.

When we think of booking flights, we imagine our bank accounts slowly dwindling. That'll no longer be the case with this nifty service. Give the travel addict in your life the gift of time with Skyhour credits that cover an hour of flight time for the cost of groceries. It operates on over 350 airlines to any destination, so youre sure to find a flight that fits.

The product description is a misnomer because its a trinket to inspire meditation, which is the opposite of thinking. Semantics aside, thinking is for intellectuals, and intellectuals tend to have a lot of money because they contribute to society and whatnot. Everything about this clever display item screams overpriced but alas, its worth every penny if it actually reminds you to chill out for a hot sec.

The more minimalist it looks, the less its trying to prove it costs a lot. Its confident in its worth. Thats the theory behind expensive-looking items, like these angular handmade chandelier earrings that make a bold statement. Plus, you can feel good about the fact that all proceeds go towards helping women artisans in Uganda provide for their families.

2018-08-14,Daily Beast,What Your Body Is Telling You When You Feel Disgusted,"There are some things nearly everyone is universally disgusted by.

Rotten pieces of fruit, pus-filled sores from an infection, horrible odors that suggest something foul is nearbywere disgusted by these things because we know they are signs of something hazardous to our health.

Then again, some people have no problem eating food thats dropped on the floor, or taking care of visibly sick patients in a hospital. And then when it comes to sex, disgust is a whole other confusing rabbit hole to tumble down into.

Being disgusted is, like being human, a complicated matterand its only been made more complicated by how vastly different our species behaves today than we ever have.

What hasnt changed, however, is the fact that humans use this biologically-based behaviorthe disgust responseas a pretext for how we also create our moral and legal codes for society.

Thats where we really get into trouble. One persons disgust is another persons fetish, maybe yet another persons indifference. Allowing our individual feelings over disgust to inform our moral sensibilities is precisely what has driven so many conflicts between different groups in history.

It might finally be time to rid ourselves of this fallacious conduct.

Thats the crux of Debra Liebermans research. You find that disgust is used in all manners to relate to all sorts of social actions, sometimes nefariously, said Lieberman, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Miami and co-author of Objection: Disgust, Morality, and the Law. Its been used, really, to divide and conquer, and exclude and attack people we dont necessarily like and approve of. Its not an accident, its not random. You see this across all cultures everywhere.

In her new book, she and her co-author, Carlton Patrick, an assistant professor of legal studies at the University of Central Florida, make one of the first ever attempts to map out how disgust goes from a psychological phenomenon to a part of how we construct our morals, and illustrate how this augurs into modern day laws, ultimately arguing that disgust belongs nowhere in the law.

Connecting disgust with discrimination means we have to start from the beginning, and understand how disgust actually works in our heads. Disgust is really an adaptation for protecting against pathogens, Lieberman said. We see that humans get disgusted by blood, guts, and goresubstances that allow for an easier transfer of disease-causing agents, and invariably lead to biological havoc inside us.

Disgust also regulates our sexual behavior and protects us from bad eggs. The idea that disgust is also used to steer us clear from sexual partners that might jeopardize our ability to have and raise and nurture offspring  its an interesting emotion that life as co-opted for that purpose, she said. People have different sexual preferences, but on the whole, most people will tell you theyll be sexually disgusted by people who appear diseased, are close kin, are super-old, or are super-young.

Context matterssometimes a lot. A single fly sitting on a piece of bread for a few seconds might be completely unacceptable to some people in normal conditions. But if you havent eaten all day, even a family of swarming flies might not keep you from scarfing down a sour loaf in mere seconds. None of us should drink our own urine, but if youre stranded in the desert with no more clean water, you dont really have any other options.

Most people are disgusted by incest. But all the time? Lieberman laughed. More than a few peoples porn searches would make that point crystal clear.

Ones own condition really influences how flexible you are, not just for food choice, but also for mate choice, Lieberman added. Its all about trade-offs.

And trade-offs mean weve developed ways to override what disgusts us. A disease-avoidance system, like disgust, would keep you away from other people and their bodily fluids. But then you need an entirely other system (i.e. sexual attraction and fetishes) to override that, since sex requires you to be all over that other person and their fluids. Another override might be our desire to be part of social groups and feel valuedsomething that actually has nothing to do with cleanliness or sex.

Humans are driven to turn evolutionary adaptations into rules for living in social groups, and that includes turning our disgust response into laws. Sometimes this works out well: raw milk is dangerous, so you shouldnt be allowed to sell it to consumersno matter how much you love freedom. Other times, however, this leads us down a dangerous path, and we assign values to people by virtue of what they eat, what they are in contact with, and who they choose to have sex with.

Homosexuality is essentially a test case for how this works, and also a brilliant example of how the norms for disgust change as society moves forward. From an evolutionary perspective, homosexual men are basically saying, We dont care about women, we dont want anything to do with women, and theyre not really producing any children, Lieberman said.

From the perspective of heterosexual men, this should theoretically be applauded, since it creates less competition for males to find mating partners, and should also (if we ignore modern day advances in allowing gay couples to have biological children and start families) free up more resources for their own kids.

But instead of seeing politicians praising homosexuality and erecting statues in gratitude, homosexuals have been consistently persecuted, marginalized, and attacked throughout history. We think it has a lot to do with the idea that men evolved to protect resources, Lieberman said. Part of that protection has been to identify groups that could potentially jeopardize access to resources. You even see this in chimps. We identify groups to be wary of, and then we attack and destroy them.

Modern technology has actually helped to blunt and remediate this problem. Television, movies, social media let us know there are gay people living in the most remote parts of the world, just as there might be gay people living right across the street from us.

The optics are changing, Lieberman said. Social psychologists have known for a while that if you keep subjecting someone to same thing, its becomes less objectionable. Numbers really do change the optics of how formidable a group is, and therefore how willing one should be to organize against them.

Our capacity for flipping our disgust perceptions is actually fast and flexible, and the reason why were seeing rapidly changing moral views more recently is because social media and related technologies are transforming the disgust rhetoric around those issues more radically. While homosexuals are still disenfranchised more than heterosexuals, they are also experiencing less persecution these days than at any point in history. Less people perceive gay relationships with disgust, and as a result, the laws are changing.

Id argue this is one of the really nice things about social mediain my mind, one of the only benefits of social media, said Lieberman.

The problem is that there is always another group to go after. Theres this thirst in a coalitional psychology (mainly in men but also in women) to identify groups to target and resources to secure. Disgust is one of the ways we identify people we dont value as highly. If you still need convincing, just think about the words Donald Trump uses when it comes to talking about women, immigrants, the press, foreign peoples, and more.

Cleansing the law of disgust does not mean rewiring millions of years of evolution and changing our species. Disgust will always be a part of our behavior, so long as theres rotten food abound and unattractive people hitting on us at the bar. But understanding how disgust works might allow us to stop ourselves from using it as a way to unfairly and irrationally attack others. Few people might argue against that."
2018-09-05,Daily Beast,Bob Woodward Bane of Presidents Turns His Fire on Cheeto Jesus,"Washington, D.C. may soon be littered with the political bodies of people who believed they could spin their way out of the impact of the new Bob Woodward book, Fear. Ive been to the Washington rodeo enough times to know that Woodwards methodical, grinding style of investigation doesnt lend itself to escaping unscathed, especially for bad actors and loose cannons. Hell, as a young Department of Defense aide in 1990, I saw it up close when his book The Commanders led to the firing of USAF Chief of Staff Mike Dugan. He had tapes then, as he does now.

This week, its Donald Trumps turn under Woodwards political electron microscope, and the presidents hissy-fit reaction tells us how close Woodwards work has struck. Trump knows his White House staff, up to and including his daughter, thinks hes off the rails, a danger to himself and the country, and unable to execute the duties of a Waffle House manager much less the president of the United States.

Instantly, Washington has divided into familiar camps. For Trump fans, everyone else in the world is lying, and only Trump speaks the truth. For them, Woodward and his dozens of sources are fabulists, making it all up to harm the political fortunes of President Trump. For the rest of us, theres the comforting knowledge that Trumps White House just read the first draft of their history, and it isnt pretty. From Trumps insult-a-minute style to his profanity-laden regret at admitting he was wrong about Charlottesville, nothing here is flattering to a man deeply addicted to flattery.

Regardless of what Trumps partisans will assert, Woodwards scythe has cut through both Republican and Democratic administrations. When Woodwards The Agenda told the story of the Clinton White Houseincluding Hillary Clintons rasp-tongued reprimands of her feckless husband and his ideological ditheringthe outraged denials were similar to what we see today. The Bush White House fought with Woodward over George Tenets slam dunk statement about Iraqs WMDs. Bluster and denial were followed by, well, silence. Woodward works the details, gets the interviews, transcribes the tapes, and checks and cross-checks his sources accounts.

Is Woodward perfect? Of course not.

Journalists (like all of us) fall short, miss facts, and blow up small details. Whats remarkable is that with Woodward, as both chronicler and nemesis of Republican and Democrat administrations alike since 1972, we can look at the corpus of his investigative journalism as an impressive monument to the form.

Woodward once said of his work, I believe there is a place for reporting that aspires to combine the thoroughness of history with the contemporaneity of journalism. Occasional mistakes and disputed quotes aside, hes delivered five decades of granular reporting from Washingtons inner sanctum, the Oval Office. Woodward conducts hundreds of hours of in-depth interviews with key players, relentlessly verifies statements with other key players, and builds a picture that captures the inner workings, relationships, and temperament in successive White House cultures.

In his expose of Team Trump, much of Woodwards reporting directly confirms other tales of a White House beset with chaos and crisis and led by a man his most loyal aides fear may start World War III. The stories that have leaked out in a constant flood since his inauguration are told here in greater detail than before, and this isnt the first time weve heard tales of Mattis, Tillerson, and many of the other members of the shrinking Axis of Adults desperate to contain and constrain the Madness of King Donald. These men, now firmly in the Trump crosshairs, have taken extraordinary steps to preserve the power and standing of the United States from Trump's impulsive and dangerous temperament.

To witness Sarah Huckabee Sanders walking herself into the classic trap of D.C.s most incompetent spinners on the topic of Woodwards book was like watching someone stick a fork into a toaster. This book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the president look bad, her risible statement read. Democrats and their allies in the media understand the presidents policies are working and with success like this, no one can beat him in 2020not even close. This last sentence of her lame rebuttal was mere filler, whistling past the graveyard of political history.

Heres the problem for Trump supporters: Woodwards recounting of the chaos, discord, and toxic atmosphere inside the White House, and of Trumps erratic and dangerous behavior, echoes both other reporting and the clear reality. From serious journalism like Woodwards, to Omarosas embittered but demonstrably insider take, to Fire and Fury, to my own book on Trump and his team, the story is the same. In this political Rashomon, the perspectives are so similar because the truth is so evident.

What we see, especially via Woodward, is a de facto execution of the 25th Amendment. Trumps Cabinet members remove papers from his desk, ignore his more lunatic orders, make sure hes out of the loop on consequential decisions, and run separate policies both at home and abroad to forestall the damage his ego and anger may cause to Americas reputation and security. None of this is pretty, and even those who oppose Trump will stir uneasily at the extra-constitutional risks taken by Trumps staff to prevent even worse consequences.

The tale told in Fear is one of an administration led by a man who combines rampant personal instability, ravenous ego, and an inability to tell the truth even when it would help his legal and political standing. Trumps allies and supporters will dismiss Woodwards latest opus as fake news while the man they worship continues to prove the veteran journalists assertions every day."
2018-08-11,Daily Beast,A Year Since Charlottesville Trump Has Made Things Worse,"Once again my home state of Virginia has had to declare a state of emergency around the issue of race. It seems surreal in the year 2018.

This time the emergency was declared in preparation for the one-year anniversary of the Charlottesville Unite the Right protesta rally that left counter-protester Heather Heyer, a 22year old white female dead, and others, like DeAndre Harris, an African American male (who was beaten violently by six white men) seriously injured.

The purpose of this second rally, scheduled for this weekend in D.C., is to protest the civil rights abuses that the white nationalists feel they have suffered by being denied a permit to return to Charlottesville.The news here, of course, is not the location of the rally. It is that the same group that organized in Charlottesville last year feels perfectly comfortable congregating again in the nations capital. Perhaps the uglier news is that in the last year, the views of this group have made their waysometimes subtly, sometimes overtlythroughout our everyday life and discourse.

On Wednesday evening Fox News host Laura Ingraham echoed the fears of the nationalists, when she openly declared on LIVE national TV that  we are in a state of national emergency, and that we must demand that Congress act now."" The national emergency she spoke of was not a terror attack, a Russian cyber attack, or natural disaster, It was, instead, the emergency of ""massive demographic changes.""

Ingraham continued her diatribe , ""In some parts of the country, it does seem like the America that we know and love doesn't exist anymore,"" she lamented. ""Massive demographic changes have been foisted upon the American people, and they are changes that none of us ever voted for, and most of us don't like. From Virginia to California, we see stark examples of how radically, in some ways, the country has changed.""

Ingraham finally said out loud what the rest of us know has been driving the racial animus under President Trump: white fear of demographic changes in America.

Ingraham is a national TV personality. But those fears she laid bare are also taking root in local communities. One black man, Ketchazo Paho of Bethesda, Maryland said a white man smashed him in the head with a bicycle lock on Monday morning after repeatedly calling him the n-word in the capitals toniest neighborhood of Georgetown. Before that, the man had damaged Pahos car. He received eighteen stitches to his head to close his wounds.

Its unclear whether the person charged with the assault, 24-year-old Maxim Smith, has any ties to the white nationalists organizing the Unite the Right rally scheduled to be held near the White House Sunday. But Pahos attorney, S. Lee Merritt, Esq. who also represented DeAndre Harrisoffered this:

While theres no known affiliations at this time, we know about the speech that he used, the kind of hate speech, that rhetoric, that is consistent with these types of groups. We have a lot of hate groups coming to the DC area this weekend and I think its critically important that we get out ahead of that, that law enforcement knows that they need to clamp down, because these groups are notoriously violent.

Mr. Merits point is that people of color need to be on alert, because violence has now spilled over into everyday citizens, not just at official marches or protests. And its not just physical violence. Its the subtle violence done to black and brown people over the past year in the form of 9-11 calls made by white citizens on black citizens for sitting at Starbucks, checking into their Airbnb residence, sleeping at their Yale University dorm, or eating peacefully at Smith college, which they attend.

As we reflect as a nation on what happened last yearin the normally quiet college town of CharlottesvilleI think we can all agree that we are not in a much better place. Maybe even worse. The President of the United States, who traditionally in these situations is a voice of calm and national unity, failed our country miserably last summer when he hedged his language as to who was to blame for the violence. Trump infamously said, there were fine people on both sides. Unlike Lincoln, Eisenhower, Kennedy or Johnson, he did not call out the racists or their behavior. He did not call out white men carrying torches in the dark, spewing anti-Semitic, Naziesque chants.

Instead he argued, he pushed back, he stood his ground, and he tacitly gave his base permission to be angrier, more divisive, and more open about their aggression toward black and brown people in America.

Corporate executives who publicly protested Trumps equivocation on Charlottesville, and resigned from his White House corporate committee, a year later returned to dine with him at his New Jersey summer golf retreat just days ago. It seems that all is forgotten, and that some of these executives want to be back in Trumps good graces.

Will Trump make a public statement or appeal to these white nationalists gathering in D.C. to leave America and Americans alone? Will he call on the nation to heal in the midst of a year of ever-escalating racial turmoil? Will he talk about the immigrant children internment camps on the border, the violent deaths of African Americans like 18-year-old Nia Wilson whose throat was slashed in July by a white man on a BART train, or will he say nothing?

Time will tell, but my guess is that Trump will ignore this weekend and continue golfing at his summer retreat as if it never happened.

The most disturbing thing to me about where I see my country right now, is that Americas present looks a lot more like her past. Not since President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, have we had a President so insensitive to matters of race, equality and national unity. It was Wilson who showed the racist Klan movie, Birth of a Nation in the White House. It was Wilson who oversaw the resegregation of multiple agencies of the federal government, which had been surprisingly integrated because of Reconstruction decades earlier. It was Wilson who himself fired 15 out of 17 black supervisors in the federal service and replaced them with white people.

Trump may not be as openly racist as Wilson. But his administration has made clear their desire to roll back affirmative action in education and in the workforce, he has literally caged immigrant children and separated them from their families, and implemented a Muslim travel ban to name just a few examples. The Trump administration is the richest and whitest we have seen in recent memory. And coming on the heels of the nations first black president, Trump ran on code words like Make America Great Again and dog whistles that signaled to his base that he was going to restore America to her so-called glory days of oldmeaning those days when blacks, women, and brown people knew their place.

The question we must all ask is not just why have we not progressed over the last year, but where do we go from here? Will we give into our racists past, or will we come together, us, we the people and demand from our President and of ourselves a better future. Times are bleak but, fortunately, that decision is still ours."
2018-03-21,Daily Beast,Cambridge Analytica Looked to Pounce on Russian Hacks Email Shows,"Cambridge Analytica hoped to capitalize on Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton and her ally, an email written by one of its employees indicates.

Emily Cornell, the employee, sent the email on July 29, 2016. It went out to people working with Make America Number One, the pro-Trump super PAC funded by Republican super-donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer.

After noting some of the firms work for the super PAC, Cornell wrote: With her campaign getting hacked, I can only imagine what a new swatch [sic] of emails will do to her already fractured base!

Cornell did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the email. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica also did not respond to requests for comment.

On July 22, seven days before Cornells email, WikiLeaks had published almost 20,000 emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. The hackwhich included emails showing some DNC officials pushing for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the primarythrew the Democratic Party into turmoil. Then-DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned from her post because of the hack. On July 27, then-candidate Trump said in a press conference that he hoped Kremlin-backed individuals would find emails Clinton deleted as secretary of State.

Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, he said.

His allies later said he was joking.

Cambridge Analytica has drawn intense scrutiny since the election. This week, the U.K.s Channel 4 released two documentaries on the companys internal practices based on hidden-camera footage. In one, a Cambridge Analytica official says the company used Ukrainian sex workers to try to entrap its clients political foes.

Just saying we could bring some Ukrainians in, the firms CEO Alexander Nix said to journalists posing as prospective clients. They are very beautiful. I find that works very well.

Cambridge Analytica announced Tuesday it has suspended Nix pending an independent investigation.

Mr. Nixs recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation, the firm said in a statement."
2018-08-08,Daily Beast,Republican Rep Chris Collins Arrested for Insider Trading and Lying to FBI,"Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) was arrested Wednesday on federal charges of insider trading for allegedly using his position at a pharmaceutical company to leak information to his son, who then used it to company dump stock before it crashed. He is also charged with lying to the FBI.

Collins sat on the board of directors of Innate Immunotherapeutics, an Australian pharma company where he was also lead shareholder. Cameron Collins, his son, was also a shareholder, as was Camerons father-in-law to-be. All three have been charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York.

Innate was anxiously awaiting the results of an FDA trial for its experimental multiple-sclerosis drug in 2017 when it got news the drug failed. The FDA told Innates CEO, who then told the board of directors, including Collins.

I have bad news to report, the CEOs email began.

Minutes later, Collins frantically called to his son while he was attending a congressional picnic at the White House. After trying six times, Collins finally got through to Cameron and allegedly told him Innates drug was a bust. Cameron then gave the news to his fiancees family, who were also invested in Innate: the fiancee, her father Stephen Zarsky, his wife, as well as Zarky's friend. (Zarsky also allegedly tipped off his brother, his sister, and a long-standing friend, who were all invested in Innate.)

Ironically, it was Cameron who convinced the family to invest in the first place, according to the indictment.

When U.S. markets opened the following morning, Cameron placed an order to sell 16,508 shares of Innate stock. Over the next few days, he placed dozens more orders. One time, Cameron was on the phone with his father when placed an order to dump 50,000 shares.

Zarksys family also sold off stock, the feds say.

Feds say the trades allowed them all to avoid over $768,000 in loses that they would have otherwise incurred if they had sold their stock in Innate after the Drug Trial results became public.

When the news finally did go public, Innates stock dropped 92 percent in value in one day.

Though Collins is accused of providing inside information, authorities say he did not trade on it because his Innate shares were listed on the Australian stock exchange, where trading was halted as soon as Innate heard from the FDA. (U.S. trading was not halted.)

Collins lawyers highlighted that in a statement defending him.

""We will answer the charges filed against Congressman Collins in Court and will mount a vigorous defense to clear his good name. It is notable that even the government does not allege that Congressman Collins traded a single share of Innate Therapeutics stock. We are confident he will be completely vindicated and exonerated.

Collins already faced a congressional investigation over the allegations before criminal charges were ever filed.

Indeed, just days before the alleged insider trading, he was interviewed by the Office of Congressional Ethics about his dealings with Innate. OCE recommended the House Ethics Committee probe Collins over his apparent use of office to benefit Innate. (The committee has not formally begun its investigation.)

Collinss son and Zarksy are also charged with lying to the FBI. They and Collins also face counts of wire fraud and mail fraud."

2018-03-25,Daily Beast,Rick Santorum to Student Activists Dont March Learn CPR,"The day after hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters marched across the country and the world to advocate action on gun violence, Rick Santorum told CNN that they might as well give up now.

How about kids instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem, do something about maybe taking CPR classes or trying to deal with situations that when there is a violent shooter that you can actually respond to that? the former Republican senator suggested on State of the Union.

He went on to dismiss the action taken by the student activists who survived a mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, last month as little more than asking someone else to pass a law.

They didnt take action to say, How do I, as an individual, deal with this problem? How am I going to do something about stopping bullying within my own community? What am I going to do to actually help respond to a shooter? Santorum said. Those are the kind of things where you can take it internally, and say, Heres how Im going to deal with this. Heres how Im going to help the situation, instead of going and protesting and saying, Oh, someone else needs to pass a law to protect me.

But as CNNs Van Jones pointed out, it is ultimately up to lawmakers, not students, to pass laws to protect them. Speaking of his own teenage son, he said, If his main way to survive high school is learning CPR so when his friends get shotthat to me, weve gone too far. Im proud of these kids. I know you're proud of these kids too.

Santorum responded by saying he is proud of the students, but in the next breath criticized them for believing some phony gun law is going to prevent the next school shooting. Phony gun laws dont solve these problems, he said.

More than using the march to try to convince lawmakers to change their views, the student activists have said the main goal is to encourage voters to show up at the polls for the midterm elections this fall.

As one Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student told The New York Times this week, if politicians in Congress do not act on guns following the march,Im going to vote them out of office. And so is my entire generation. And theyll be sorry then."
2018-07-06,Daily Beast,Sasquatch Hunting Goes Mainstream in Small Canadian Town,"With gritted teeth and a stern face befitting a former army man, Thomas Steenburg starts our Sasquatch-hunting wilderness tour in Harrison Hot Springs a couple hours east of Vancouver with a brusque disclaimer.

Odds are you arent going to see anything. If we could guarantee seeing a Sasquatch, this mystery would be over.

He then shares the golden rule of serious investigators.

Pausing for dramatic effect, he spits out the final word: Ever.

I was raised on the Sasquatch legend, dreaming that the huge, hairy, ape-like creature from British Columbia might sneak across four Canadian provinces to my cottage. I once dated an extra-tall guy nicknamed Sasq. Now, Ive asked Sasquatch Country Adventures to show me the creatures main stomping grounds, open my mind and maybe even blow it. No cheesy hoaxes needed.

Bill Miller, who owns the company but lives in Illinois, isnt around, so Steenburg sets the meeting spot at the Husky gas station just past the new Harrison Sasquatch Museum.

People used to be embarrassed that this part of the Fraser Valley two hours east of Vancouver is the Sasquatch capital of the world. Now they see the tourism potential.

The museum opened during Sasquatch Days in June, an intercultural celebration that happened once in 1938 and then not again until 2012. Now, the village and the First Nations band Stsailes put it on annually, with war canoe races, medicine walks, salmon barbecues and Sasquatch storytelling.

The Sasquatch has been part of Stsailes lore for thousands of years as the primary caretaker that watches over the land and moves between the physical and spirit worlds. The word Sasquatch is believed to be a mispronounced, anglicized version of the Stsailes word Sa:sqets. The bands trademarked logo features a black, red and white formline drawing of the hairy creature.

Americans, especially in northern California and along the west coast, know Sasquatch as Bigfoot. Sasquatch (or Bigfoot) is a cryptid, or a creature whose existence has been reported but not scientifically confirmed. People who research cryptids are cryptozoologists. In Asia, you have the Yeti or Abominable Snowman. Scotland has the Loch Ness Monster. And so on.

I hop in Steenburgs Nissan XTerra to tow a Polaris Ranger side-by-side to the edge of Sasquatch Provincial Park, silently commending the open-minded government for the 1968 name change from Green Point Park.

Actually Poulin is training as a tour guide. It feels weird for law enforcement types to dabble in this grey zone, but these two skeptics insist theyre drawn to Sasquatch as investigators.

You never know what well see today, muses Poulin. Steenburg has been immersed in this subject since the 1970s and might have had a fleeting encounter in 2004, but admits the figure was too far away to be sure.

I think if Sasquatch does exist, its a flesh and blood animal  a large primate, he opines, citing a dominant theory that Sasquatch is a nearly extinct hominid from the family of great apes that includes orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and humans. He wonders if Gigantopithecus blacki , the worlds largest ape, is really extinct.

For two hours we zip down logging roads, stopping first to check a muddy puddle for footprints, and later to study a bizarre congregation of butterflies on the moist road dirt.

Sasquatch Country Adventures has taken out hundreds of people since 2011.

The companys founder Bill Millers life changed in 1980 with an intense, unexplained sighting while night fishing for bass and catfish in northern Minnesota. His research led him to a Vancouver conference where he met Steenburg and the late John Green, a world-renowned Sasquatch investigator, journalist and former Harrison Hot Springs mayor.

Miller made the village his Canadian home base in 2005 after health issues forced him on disability. Watching the resort community struggle with declining tourism while people begged to join his research trips, he launched a tour company to offer guided outings that are supposed to be more scientific than opinionated.

Theres not many undiscovered mysteries in this world anymore  Sasquatch is definitely one of them, Miller says from Illinois. People from around the world come to Harrison for one reason.

Make that at least two. Like other anglers chasing unique fishing experiences around the world, I actually came to this area mainly because the Fraser River is renowned for mammoth white sturgeon, a survivor from the dinosaur age that can top 1,000 pounds. Sturgeon Hunter Steve Kaye took me out on the river for a day and helped me catch and release two dinosaurs of the deep. My biggest fish was six-foot-eight and took almost 90 minutes to reel in. I tried a couple of times throughout the day to talk to the no-nonsense fishing guide about mythical creatures and my Sasquatch hunting experience, but he brushed me off. For the record, we didnt see anything suspicious from the boat, and Kaye doesnt give a moments thought to Sasquatch.

Robert Reyerse does, though. The executive director of Tourism Harrison says local businesses are done distancing themselves from Sasquatch. Tourists come here for the hot springs, hiking, and Sasquatch, and so the small Harrison Hot Springs Visitor Centre was rejiggered to create the museum that everybody had been asking for.

Were hoping, for the people who are interested, it gives them what they need, says Reyerse. More pragmatically, he hopes it gives people something to do on a rainy day.

Miller, Steenburg and researcher Chris Murphy provided material and guidance for the one-room, admission-by-donation museum that opened quietly in November and officially in March, but saved its grand opening for Sasquatch Days.

Wood cabinets showcase footprint casts, masks, statues, and a Gigantopithecus skull recreated from a real jaw discovery. Framed background stories fill the walls. A map pinpoints top local sightings. A binder preserves news articles, like the 1929 one in Macleans magazine by the man who coined the name Sasquatch.

The visitors center sells souvenirs like books by the likes of Miller and Steenburg, Sasquatch sweat soap, and specially commissioned Hot Springs Harry stuffies and backpack fobs. A giant version of the smiling Harry  the official mascot  looms over the room. The village is home to three carved Sasquatch benches, a few statues and assorted murals.

Miller wants a billboard to boost business so he can hire extra guides and finance more research. Steenburg, meanwhile, earns his living as a watchman since Sasquatch research is fascinating but doesnt pay the bills.

2018-04-12,Daily Beast,How OxyContin Kicked Off the Heroin Epidemic,"Purdue Pharmas attempt to stem a mushrooming opioid crisis by reformulating OxyContin is the reason why heroin replaced it and took off, causing the crisis to explode into a full-blown epidemic, according to a new working paper.

Not only that, the papers authorseconomists William N. Evans and Ethan Lieber of the University of Notre Dame, and Patrick Power of Boston Universitynarrow down the switch to August and September 2010. Once OxyContins formula changed, it became too expensive to get high off the drug, making heroin the obvious choice as its replacement, they write in the paper, published online with the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Its not necessarily the first paper to come to this conclusionanother NBER paper from January 2017 cites similar resultsbut the new paper manages to pinpoint down to the month when the dramatic change occurred. Perhaps more important, as the paper states in its abstract, the reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortalityeach opioid death was replaced with a heroin death.

And then some, it appears from data.

Lieber, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said its clear a substitution effect of sorts was occurring. What we were doing when we came across this data was asking two questions: Is something changing somewhere in this time line? And if so, when is it changing?

The substitution effect will likely be a familiar term for anyone whos ever taken an Economics 101 course. Its a pretty simple concept: When the price of a good rises, the consumer will redirect their purchase of said product toward a cheaper alternative. If, for example, the price of name brand, gourmet string cheese goes up, consumers will veer towards the generic, less fancy but cheaper mozzarella stick as a substitute.

Lieber and his colleagues found evidence of the substitution effect with OxyContin and heroin.

Indeed, Lieber said it came down to a single month. In August 2010, something is changing in opioid use, he pointed out. And in September 2010, something is changing for heroin use.

And the causes of death almost immediately followed suit, with death rates from oxycodone peaking right around August 2010, then flattening. Heroin deaths starting spiking around September 2010.

To understand why the late summer and early fall of 2010 was pivotal for the opioid epidemic requires a bit of a back story on OxyContin reformulation, the FDA, and pill smashing.

Almost exactly five years ago, the Food and Drug Administration made a decision that helped plunge Americans into what has evolved into an unprecedented epidemic: Unlike other pharmaceuticals, it would not allow Purdue Pharmas blockbuster narcotic, OxyContin, to go generic.

By 2013, OxyContin had already developed a reputation as an addictive narcotic, a drug that, on paper, helped ease chronic pain, but could become highly habit forming, particularly when combined with alcohol. Approved in 1995, its undeniable ability to treat moderate to severe pain helped boost it to superpower status.

But patients and their doctors soon noticed that a huge problem with OxyContins composition made users more likely to become addicted. When crushed, the pill would become a powder, potentially flooding its total narcotic capabilities into the bloodstream rather than in bits and pieces, as intended.

That meant OxyContin was primed to become a dangerous drug, killing more people than it was saving. In 2010, Purdue Pharmafounded by the powerful, wealthy Sackler familyadjusted its formula, so that when a user attempted to pound the pill into a powder, it was impossible. What should have become a powder instead became a gelatinous mass.

That fundamental change was supposed to help stem the worrisome spike in patients who were becoming addicted to OxyContin. But as Lieber and his colleagues point out in their paper, it had the accidental effect of making heroin a more attractive drug.

When oxycodone was in the illicit market, the price was about a dollar per milligram, Lieber explained. For two pills a day, it came out to about $160 per day. Lieber said he didnt have the exact pricing for heroin because of its variability but said you can achieve the same high for much cheaper with heroin on a daily basis.

But even those heroin deaths are starting to flatten, thanks to fentanyl. In recent years, fentanyl has become increasingly popular as a substitute for heroin. And thats something that didnt escape the notice of Lieber and his colleagues.

That heroin delivered the same high as OxyContin for much cheaper meant it appealed to people across all demographics and socioeconomic classes. In a now frequently cited paper that traced why the mortality and morbidity of non-Hispanic white men in America is climbinga pattern that is not just worrisome but the exact opposite of what is otherwise happening in every other advanced, industrialized countryAnne Case and Angus Deaton coin the term deaths of despair.

Case and Deaton found that the combination of poor health, job loss, and opioid use to ease the stresses of trying to attain a middle-class life without the resources and job guarantees that previous generations found so abundant made for a fatal trio of factors that killed off middle-aged white men across the countryespecially white men along the Rust Belt.

Lieber said the deaths of despair pattern shows up again in their data set, with clear spikes in heroin use in states like West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan. He also said Alaska fell into this camp, despite not geographically falling into what is known as the Rust Belt.

Just last month, the CDC released a report that showed drug overdose deaths had jumped 11.4 percent in the United States between 2014 and 2015, from 46,640 people to 52,404. The vast majority of these deaths63.1 percent of them, or 33,091 deathswere due to opioids, with huge increases in deaths from non-methadone synthetic opioids.

For whos dying from opioids and who is buying heroin, we didnt do a specific study. Our data was just not good enough, Lieber said. But their data was good enough to show that the OxyContin-to-heroin switch was nationwide and that it was bad news for middle aged white men in economically struggling Heartland economies.

In January 2017, Abby Alpert, David Powell, and Rosalie Liccardo Pacula wrote a paper that came to a similar conclusion as Lieber and his colleagues: that the rise of heroin deaths could be attributed to the change in OxyContins formula. Other analyses have also hinted at the reformulation as being the possible culprit of the modern epidemic.

Powell told The Daily Beast via email that in general, the teams paper agreed with those of the new groups findings. We found their results generally complementary with our earlier findings, Powell said, citing some differences in categorizations of states and how exposed these states were to OxyContin versus heroin. Our paper showed that the legal supply of oxycodone is correlated with nonmedical use of OxyContin, so both measures should produce similar results... [but] overall, we believe that their paper offers some useful confirmation of our findings.

Both papers present data clearly indicating that government programs aiming to ease the opioid crisis by pushing for pharmaceuticals to create deterrent formulas, or changing pill recipes so they arent so easy to get high off of, is clearly not going to work, Lieber said.

In theory, this sounds like a good idea, he said. But when you have something else that people can switch to, its clear that not a lot of people will get benefits."
2018-04-29,Daily Beast,Michelle Wolf Mocks Kellyanne Conway Sarah Huckabee Sanders to Their Faces at WHCD,"Michelle Wolf was admittedly relieved when she found out President Donald Trump would once again be skipping the annual White House Correspondents Dinner this year.

The first thing I thought when I heard that he wasnt going was, Oh, thank god I dont have to hear Trump eat, the comedian and host of this years event told Jimmy Kimmel earlier this month. More recently, she called Trump cowardly for holding a rally in Washington, Michigan, instead, adding, The only other person that didnt go was Reagan when he was shot. And he called in.

Instead, Wolf was stuck on the dais with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. As she recently joked to The Daily Beast, Im just excited Sarah finally gets to go to prom.

A rising star of the stand-up comedy scene, the former Daily Show contributor is about to launch her own weekly talk show called The Break on Netflix beginning May 27. And her speech to the room of D.C. journalists and their celebrity guests Saturday night proved that she is not afraid to offend the most powerful people in the country.

Like a porn star says when shes about to have sex with a Trump, lets get this over with, Wolf began when she finally took the podium Saturday night. Just a reminder to everyone: Im here to make jokes. I have no agenda. Im not trying to get anything accomplished, so everyone thats here from Congress, you should feel right at home.

The comedian explained that she wanted to try making fun of Trump in a new way. She decided not to focus on collusion with Russia, but did say, It is kind of crazy the Trump campaign was in contact with Russia when the Hillary campaign wasnt even in contact with Michigan. Instead, she told the president, I dont think youre very rich.

Like, I think you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York youre doing fine, Wolf said. Trump is the only person that still watches Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and thinks me. Although Im not sure you would get very far. He would get to like the third question and be like, I have to phone a Fox and Friend.

From there, she went into a call-and-response segment of Trumps so broke. How broke is he? in which only a fraction of the audience in attendance seemed willing to participate. The final punchline to that bit? He had to borrow money from the Russians and now hes compromised and susceptible to blackmail and possibly responsible for the collapse of the republic!

Trump is racist, though, she continued. He loves white nationalists, which is a weird term for a Nazi. Calling a Nazi a white nationalist is like calling a pedophile a kid-friend. Or Harvey Weinstein a ladies man.

Wolf may not have gotten to make jokes to Trumps face, but she did seem to enjoy roasting administration figures in the room like Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who did not seem amused when the camera cut to them.

Kellyanne Conway has the perfect last name for what she does: Conway, she said. Its like if my name was Michelle Jokes Frizzy Hair Small Tits. You guys have to stop putting Kellyanne on your shows. If you dont give her a platform, she has nowhere to lie. Its like that old saying: If a tree falls in the woods, how do we get Kellyanne under that tree. Im not suggesting she gets hurt. Just stuck.

Wolf said Ivanka Trump has done nothing to satisfy women, adding, so I guess like father like daughter.

And then there was Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I have to say Im a little star-struck, she said. I love you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaids Tale. With Sanders just a few feet away on the dais, Wolf praised the press secretarys resourcefulness. She burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye, she said. Like maybe shes born with it, maybe its lies. Its probably lies.

As is customary at these events, Wolf also told some jokes about the major news networks in the room, including Fox News. So you know what that means, ladies, cover your drinks, she said. Seriously. People want me to make fun of Sean Hannity tonight, but I could not do that. This dinner is for journalists. On the recently engaged hosts of Morning Joe, she added, Congratulations, you guys, its like when a #MeToo works out.

Wolf ended her speech with yet another How broke is he? joke about Trump. He grabs pussies because he thinks there might be loose change in them, she said, before signing off. Like an immigrant who was brought here by his parents and didnt do anything wrong, Ive got to get the fuck out of here, goodnight!"
2018-02-06,Daily Beast,I Dont Go Out During the Day Inside Senegals LGBT Crackdown,"DAKAR, SenegalWatching as dusk falls on the dusty streets of this city, Marie, a 27-year-old trans woman, explains that she only leaves her house after sunset. I dont go out during the day, she says, flicking back her long red hair. Only at night. I dont even want to open my door. It can be lonely, Marie admits, but after facing abuse throughout her life, living alone in the dark is the only way she feels safe.

Asking that her last name be omitted for safety reasons, Marie explains that the abuse began when she was just 8-years-old. I used to wake up early to put on my sisters clothes before school, she says. I didnt want to disguise myself as a boy anymore. But in a country like Senegal, where gender roles are strictly enforced, revealing her identity left her vulnerable to attack: After years of bullying, Marie was forced to leave school at 13.

In an effort to correct what her family viewed as an aberration, Maries father put her in a strict Quranic school, where things got even worse. That was the first time I was raped, says Marie. The teachers used to come into the dorms at night and take me back to their room. Since you think youre a woman, theyd say, Were going to show you what we do with women. Afterward, Marie would lie awake in the dark, filled with shame, hoping only to be left alone.

Fifteen years later and darkness is still Maries only refuge from a society that remains deeply averse to LGBT rights. As is the case in 33 countries across Africa, gay sex is illegal in Senegal, and attacks and arrests of queer people are common (PDF).

LGBT people operate in a very hostile environment, says Francois Patuel, a researcher with Amnesty International in Dakar. Theres a lot of physical violence against men, and sexual violence towards women. They dont have any access to justice.

According to Human Rights Watch, violence against gay men and trans women has increased since 2008. Following a public scandal around a supposed gay wedding, gay men increasingly became targets of popular vengeance and arbitrary arrests. When one of the men photographed in the wedding, Madieye Diallo, died of AIDS in 2009, an angry mob disinterred his body and dragged it through town, dumping it in front of his parents home.

We had to bury him in the bush, says Djamil Bangoura, a local LGBT activist and close friend of Diallo. Thats when I saw the weakness of the state. We are not protected by the law, nor the justice system, nor the police. How do people imagine we can continue to live like this?

Sadou Ndiaye, 32, a gay man living in Dakar, remembers the period after 2008 with unease: It was too hard for gay people, he says. You couldnt even leave the house. Fearing for his safety, Ndiaye decided to flee Senegal for neighboring Mauritania: There, the penalty for being gay is death by stoning. But Ndiaye says that the anonymity of life in Mauritania was better than the constant fear in Senegal, where gay people are often publicly targeted by the media. In Mauritania nobody knows you, you dont have to be scared, he told me. You can live your gay dream.

Ndiaye is not alone. According to activist Bangoura, who visited Mauritania recently, there are dozens of gay men there who have fled oppression in Senegal. Still, Mauritania remains a hostile place for LGBT people: When the police stop you, you dont have the right to even explain yourself, says Ndiaye. But unlike in Senegal, Ndiaye explains that rampant corruption in Mauritania means you can mostly just bribe your way out of trouble. If you pay, theyll let you go free, he says. Money is the only thing that matters over there.

Still, after a year of frequent arrests, Ndiaye had enough. He decided to return to Senegal in 2010. Things were a lot quieter compared to 2008, he says. But the calm didnt last.

In 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama visited Senegal and raised the issue of LGBT rights with president Macky Sall, who refused to budge. Not long after that, a lesbian woman well call Adja*, who runs a womens rights group in Dakar, says she was thrown in jail as part of a country-wide crackdown. The following February, police arrested four men who were trying to clean their neighborhood by hunting down and attacking gay men.

Obama came to Senegal and demanded the law be changed, says Adja. I wouldve told him, great, but what means do I have to change it?

Such anti-gay backlashes have become common across sub-Saharan Africa. As Western countries have made increasing progress on gay rights, and in some cases actively pushed for similar advances in Africa, countries like Tanzania, Uganda, and Nigeria have moved in the opposite direction, cracking down on gay rights activism and passing ever more draconian legislation to suppress LGBT people.

Bamar Gueye is the executive director of Jamra, a conservative religious organization in Senegal that often speaks out against homosexuality, despite working on issues like HIV/AIDS prevention. From his dimly lit Dakar office, Gueye suggested why efforts by Obama and others to influence Senegal on LGBT rights have backfired.

Global society is being turned upside down, he says. Just because it happens in their countries they want to impose it on other places. But no one has the monopoly to dictate to others. Its the winds of excessive liberty.

In 2015, the backlash continued. Ndiaye, the gay man from Dakar, was one of 11 men arrested at a party for allegedly committing homosexual acts. He spent six months in jail. Eventually, Ndiaye was released on appeal, but the experienced has left him shaken, and hes considering going back to Mauritania.

According to Patuel, from Amnesty International, those 2015 arrests created panic in the community; people dont think they can stay here.

But despite the relative liberty afforded by corruption, life in Mauritania remains dangerous, particularly if youre one of the 22 percent of Senegalese gay and bisexual men living with HIV. Mauritanias limited health care system as well as heavy stigma around the disease can make accessing medication nearly impossible.

Their health is getting worse every day, says Bangoura of friends and colleagues he visited across the border. Theyre dying in the desert.

In Senegal, at least, there have been government efforts to tackle HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM), with support from international aid groups. However, such initiatives can only go so far while the government keeps arresting people for being gay. According to a 2011 study of HIV health care in Senegal, there was pervasive fear and hiding among MSM as a result of the December 2008 arrests and publicity. Service providers suspended HIV prevention work with MSM out of fear for their own safety.

For trans women, accessing health care is even more fraught. After running away from the Quranic school, Marie, the trans woman in Dakar, escaped to Saint-Louis, a city in northern Senegal. There, a cousin took her in, but forced her into sex work soon after: I never had a choice, says Marie, who understood the risks, but felt helpless. You dont know these people, you dont know if theyll infect you.

Sure enough, not long after leaving Saint-Louis, Marie found out she was HIV positive. I wasnt surprised, she says sadly. But since getting her diagnosis, Marie says shes often faced discrimination when seeking treatment because of her appearance. Every time I go get medicines, even if Im the first person to arrive, they always make me wait till last. But if I dont get my medicine, I could die.

Since returning from Mauritania, Ndiaye has been helping people like Marie to access HIV treatment, organizing free testing events for the LGBT community. He also has a boyfriend now: I love him, he says. He is too sweet. Still, Ndiaye wants to convince his partner to go back with him to Mauritania. Dangerous as it might be across the border, love in Senegal is lived in darkness. We can only see each other in the evenings, says Ndiaye. Its always night.

But Adja and other activists see no choice but to stay in Senegal and keep hoping for a brighter future. I wont leave, she says, as dusk falls on Dakar once more. If we all leave the country, who will continue the fight?

*Adjas name has been changed at her request to protect her identity. The other people interviewed here agreed, despite the risks, to be quoted by name.

2018-03-24,Daily Beast,Bill Maher Roasts Trump and Don Jr for Their Sex Scandals,"Bill Maher knew why his audience was cheering.

On Fridays edition of Real Time, the comedian dove into the three women suing President Donald J. Trump: Summer Zervos, a former Apprentice contestant who claims that Trump sexually harassed her in his infamous Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow, and who is set to face off against the president in a subsequent defamation suit; Karen McDougal, a former Playboy Playmate who alleges she had an affair with Trump only to have American Media Inc., which owns the Trump-friendly rag the National Enquirer, purchase the rights to her story and then bury it in a catch and kill; and last but certainly not least, Stormy Daniels, a porn star who says she conducted an affair with a then-married Trump in 2006 only to be paid for her silence and intimidated by his minions.

Facebook is a great way to go online and check out your old girlfriendslike Trump does with Pornhub, said Maher at the top of his monologue Friday.

Oh yes, lets see what went on in this weeks episode of Restoring Honor and Dignity, he continued. First, theres a former Apprentice contestant [Zervos] who says she was the victim of Trumps unwanted sexual advances, shes suing him; Playboy centerfold Karen McDougal said they had an affair, shes suing to tell her story; and of course porn star Stormy Daniels revealed a lie detector test this week about the time she was fucking Trump, and passed the test.

In addition to Trump Sr., tabloid allegations surfaced this week that his recently-divorced son, Donald Trump Jr., may have conducted an affair with the pop star Aubrey ODay during or after the fifth season of Celebrity Apprentice.

It also came out this week that Don Jr. [was] apparently having an affair with an Apprentice contestant. This must be the breakdown of the family that conservatives warned about if we allowed gay marriage, dont you think? cracked Maher.

He added, And in the Don Jr. case, his wife [Vanessa] allegedly found out about the affair becauselisten to this, its so cliche[she] checked his phone when he was in the shower, and one of the texts said, We cant keep meeting like this. Turns out that was from the Russians.

Maher also, as is his wont, couldnt resist throwing a low blow Ivanka Trumps way during a bit riffing on McDougals recent interview with CNNs Anderson Cooper.

There was a poignant moment: Karen McDougal, she said she was sorry for what she did to the other woman in the equationbut Ivanka said, Its OK, joked Maher.

The main event, however, appears to be Stormy Daniels exclusive interview this Sunday with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes, where she is said to finally open up about her affair with Trump and the alleged lengths his team went to secure her silence.

But what were all waiting for: Sunday, 60 Minutes, said Maher. Stormy Daniels is on 60 Minutes. Stormy says shes not going to go into details about sex with Donald Trump, shes saving that for another show: 60 Seconds."
2018-04-11,Daily Beast,Mueller Team Made a Grab for Paul Manaforts Privileged Docs Before Michael Cohen Raid,"After Mondays raid on Michael Cohens office, home, and hotel room, President Donald Trump tweeted: Attorney-client privilege is dead! That isnt true. But it is accurate to say that Mueller, his investigators, and the Southern District of New York team that took over the Cohen probe from him have all taken an aggressive approach to their targets legal teams.

One example, which has not been previously reported, came when Muellers investigators raided Paul Manaforts house in Virginia. Among other items, investigators seized a binder full of information that Manafort and his legal team considered privileged, according to a source familiar with the matter. Manaforts lawyer wrote a strongly worded letter to the special counsels office saying the material was privileged, and the binder was ultimately returned.

It isnt the only example of Mueller taking steps that make defense attorneys extremely nervous. His grand jury brought in one of Manaforts former lawyers, Melissa Laurenza, for questioning. She had helped Manafort fill out lobbying disclosure forms for the Justice Department. Judge Beryl Howell, who oversees Muellers grand jury, issued an opinion finding that attorney-client privilege did not extend to Laurenza because the work she did for Manafort was public and because her communications with Manafort could have been part of a criminal activity.

The grand jury also questioned former Manafort spokesperson Jason Maloni, who the law firm WilmerHale had hired to represent him. Mueller also questioned Mark Corallo, formerly a spokesperson for Trumps legal team.

And at least one lawyer will do prison time because of the Mueller probe: Alexander van der Zwaan, who helped write a report for Manafort on then-president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych.

Though lawyers are generally protected from questioning by zealous prosecutors, there are exceptionsas Michael Cohen learned the hard way. One exception is when the lawyer and his or her client are engaged together in a criminal scheme. The U.S. Attorneys Manual has a specific section laying out when and why prosecutors can use this exception to demand information about communications between attorneys and their clients. Its likely this exception is the justification for the raid on Cohens office and home.

Despite that clearly delineated exception to attorney-client privilege, any time prosecutors question lawyers about their clients it always raises eyebrows. Victoria Toensing, formerly a contender to join the presidents legal team, told The Daily Beast yesterday that the raid was highly unethical and an attempt to destroy Trumps presidency.

Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said he found Muellers decision to bring Laurenza before the grand jury extremely troubling.

He effectively made Manaforts own lawyer a witness against her client, he told The Daily Beast. Im still astonished that a federal court allowed that to occur. It was unnecessary given the other evidence that Mueller had. It was exceptionally heavy-handed and was designed to drive a wedge between Manafort and his counsel. It also sent a chilling message to lawyers who are representing people in the Mueller investigation.

But Peter Vincent, an attorney who briefed Mueller when he worked at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia, told The Daily Beast that Muellers approach shouldnt come as a surprise.

Mueller is taking an appropriately muscular approach, however hes beingas alwaysextremely cautious in order not to cross any ethical lines whatsoever, Vincent said. I think he feels like he can take an aggressive approach because he has done all of the necessary due diligence and has taken the necessary steps to ensure that nothing he is doing crosses any sort of ethical lines.

Michael Wildes, a former federal prosecutor, said while Muellers tactics may be tough on his targets, they are necessary.

Mueller is one of the most decorated law enforcement officials of our era, and while it appears very aggressive, its still for the best of our nation that this is ferreted out properly, he said. If people are innocent, its an uncomfortable thing to go through. Itll pass."
2018-04-24,Daily Beast,Russia Spy Hack Case Rocked as Judge Stiff-Arms Feds,"SAN FRANCISCOSentencing for a man who hacked into Gmail accounts on behalf of Russian intelligence was unexpectedly postponed Tuesday, with a federal judge voicing skepticism over the Justice Departments request that the hacker spend nearly eight years in prison.

Karim Baratov, a 23-year-old Canadian citizen born in Kazakhstan, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy and identity theft charges last November in connection with a mercenary hacking service he operated from 2010 until his arrest in March 2017. Baratov charged customers about $100 to obtain another persons webmail password, using phishing attacks that tricked users into entering their credentials into a fake password reset page. He cracked more than 11,000 accounts in Russia and the U.S. before he was caught.

But in what was supposed to be Baratovs sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said he was worried that the government was asking for an unusually long sentence because one of Baratovs many clients turned out to be a Russian intelligence officer accused in a massive 2014 data breach at Yahoo that impacted 500 million users.

One concern I have is that the sentence the government is requesting for Mr. Baratov relates to the fact that hes been caught up with a co-defendant who apparently was the Yahoo mega hacker, said Chhabria. Mr. Baratov did not have any involvement in the conspiracy to conduct the Yahoo mega hack.

Im not comfortable with the governments proposed term of custody without getting more information, the judge added later, repeating his worries that the government was asking for a sentence disproportionate to Baratovs own actions because the case is tied up with the Yahoo mega hack and about Russians.

The government sought a sentence of seven years, 10 months in prison, while the defense asked for about half that. Instead Chhabria moved the sentencing to May 29 to allow the judge to examine sentences in other hacking cases, and allow time for both sides to file additional briefs.

Federal officials treated Baratovs case as a national security matter because one of Baratovs clients worked for Russias Federal Security Service, or FSB. Using the alias Patrick Nag, the FSB officer allegedly commissioned hacks on 80 people, including victims within other Russian agencies, and government officials in neighboring Eastern European nations.

Only eight of those hack attempts were successful, and the government and Baratovs defense team agree that the hacker did not know that the commissions were coming from the Russian government.

It just happened to be a client of his, said defense lawyer Andrew Mancilla, in an interview ahead of the sentencing hearing. He didnt know that he was dealing with the FSB at all.

Baratov began hacking webmail accounts when he was a kid, and at first it was just a hobby, according to a sentencing brief filed by his lawyers. When a grateful client voluntarily gave him some money as a thank-you, his entrepreneurial drive kicked in. He began advertising his services across Russian Internet servers, and his business began to grow, the lawyer wrote.

Pre-sentencing wrangling focused largely on the mercenary flavor of Baratovs business. Defense lawyers said Baratov generally assumed his clients were jealous lovers or spouses spying on their significant others, and they argued that Baratovs neutralityhed work for anyone with the money to spendrendered him less culpable than defendants in otherwise similar cases who performed their intrusions as part of a financial fraud scheme or for voyeurism. Karim is a very different type of hacker, Mancilla told The Daily Beast. He didnt intend to personally harm people.

The government argued the opposite: If anything Baratov is more culpable because the hacks were individualized, and he just didnt care who his victims were or why he was hacking them.

He took orders from his customers... without needing any information about the victims, for example to reveal whether they were adults or children, sick or well, or any other characteristics someone interested in minimizing harm might consider, prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum. The correspondence with his customers shows that as long as he was paid, he hacked into victim webmail accounts with little, if any, discussion with his customers about their identity, motives, and plans.

Youre saying its more nefarious than hacking into a company stealing everyones personal information and then selling it on the market? asked Judge Chhabria at Tuesdays hearing.

I think it is, yes, replied Scott McCullogh, an attorney with the Justice Departments National Security Division.

The government illustrated its point by filing an affidavit by one of the FBI agents on the case describing the kinds of people Baratov worked for. One of the hackers customers was someone who claimed to be in the business of hurting or killing people for moneythe customer even sent Baratov a price list. Baratov did business with the ersatz hit-man anyway.

Subsequently, the defendant provided that customer with stolen passwords for targeted victims, wrote FBI agent Aleksandr Kobzanets. The defendant also exchanged emails with that customer through August 2012 about the hacking of and payment for additional victims webmail accounts.

And theres little chance Baratov thought the FSB officer who ordered hacks on 80 different webmail accounts was a snooping spouse, the government added.

That Russian, Dmitry Dokuchaev, is charged as a co-conspirator in the case, though hes unlikely to wind up in a San Francisco courtroom. Dokuchaev was arrested in Russia by his FSB colleagues in December 2016 and charged with treason, under circumstances that remain shrouded in mystery.

Another FSB officer, Igor Sushchin, is also charged in the indictment for allegedly overseeing the email hacking, as is a long-notorious Russian hacker named Alexsey Belan who was already wanted in two states for conventional cybercrime. The three Russian nationals are accused of conspiring to commit the 2014 data breach at Yahoo.

They allegedly turned to Baratov to fill the gap when they encountered an FSB target that used Gmail, or another provider, instead of Yahoo where they had complete access.

The government stressed the need to deter hackers like Baratov give how easily theyre weaponized by hostile governments like Russias.

For cybercriminals like the defendant, there must be a significant sentence of imprisonment that accounts for hacking in such a prolific and indifferent manner that one is hired as a proxy for the Russian FSB, prosecutors wrote.

U.S. sentencing guidelines scale a hacking defendants prison term based on the number of victims. Before Tuesdays hearing concluded, Judge Chhabria said he was uncertain if all 11,000 of Baratovs victims should be included in that calculus under the law. It sounds like its undisputed that the vast majority of victims were looking at... are people who live in Russia who were victimized by somebody who was living in Canada, he said. How does this affect the analysis here?

We dont know that all of these victims were in Russia, answered McCulloch. We know that some of the Russian speakers were in the United States and were targeted by the FSB for that reason.

Either way, said McCulloch, the U.S. counts all victims the same, regardless of where they live. To do otherwise would run the risk of emulating Russian law enforcement, which turns a blind eye to computer crimes committed by Russian nationals against foreign targets.

Thats what the FSB does, said McCulloch."
2018-08-07,Daily Beast,Primary Preview What to Watch For in Ohio Michigan and Kansas,"A season of raucous primary elections appears likely to feature another big night on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump tossed a grenade into a Republican vs. Republican race with the surprise endorsement of a far-right candidate hoping to overthrow a sitting governor.

Kris Kobach, a strong and early supporter of mine, is running for Governor of the Great State of Kansas, Trump wrote in a tweet sent Monday afternoon. He is a fantastic guy who loves his State and our Country - he will be a GREAT Governor and has my full & total Endorsement! Strong on Crime, Border & Military.

Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, is hoping that his hardline immigration views and a crowded fieldthere are seven Republican candidateswill be enough to overcome financial shortfalls and a cozy history with white supremacists. Kobach, as well as five other Republican challengers, is aiming to ride Trump-style anti-establishment fervor to unseat current Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer.

Elsewhere in the Wheat State, Democrats are jockeying in an effort to peel off some of the states Republican-held seats, including Kansas 3rd Congressional District, which includes Kansas City and which Hillary Clinton won by a single point in 2016.

Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder currently represents the district, and a diverse group of Democrats is competing to topple the four-term congressman, including lawyer Brent Welder, beneficiary of the double-barrel progressive endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Sharice Davids, a former mixed martial arts fighter backed by EMILYs List who would make history as the first openly lesbian Native American woman ever to serve in Congress, is also running for the nomination.

In the states 4th Congressional District, civil rights attorney James Thompson, another beneficiary of the combined Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez endorsement, is running again after coming up short in 2017 in a surprisingly close race for this seat, which was vacated after Mike Pompeo became director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

In Ohio, the nations last special congressional election pits Franklin County Recorder Danny OConnor against Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson. An election to replace outgoing Rep. Pat Tiberi, who resigned to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable, was supposed to be a breeze for the Republican Partythe seat hasnt gone Democratic since 1939, save for a brief two-year term starting in 1981has turned into a coin flip.

Trump recently swooped into the district, which stretches from Zanesville in the east to the edge of Richland County north of Columbus, to help rally the troops for Balderson on Saturday night. While the practical significance of the contest is minimaleither man would serve until November, at which point theyd be in an election contest again against each otherthe symbolic ramifications of the race are enormous, particularly for the Republican Party.

There is deep concern that even a narrow victory for Republicans in the 12th District, from which Gov. John Kasich hails, would portend a very challenging environment for the GOP in November, especially in districts that include similar wealthy and educated suburban voters who may be beginning to turn away from the president.

OConnor, like Conor Lamb, the last Democrat to pull off such an upset in western Pennsylvania earlier this year, has attempted to present himself as an independent with a specific eye on protecting Social Security and Medicare. Republican groups, which have injected millions into the race, have strayed from a strictly economic message in recent weeks in favor of ads tying OConnor to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and the broader Resistance.

In Michigan, the marquee matchup on Tuesday pits three Democrats against each other in the gubernatorial primary in Michigan, where polling suggests the winner has a shot at taking back the governorship in November. Former state senator Gretchen Whitmer has led in most polling, but Abdul El-Sayed, a Muslim-American doctor running on Medicare for All and a set of leftist platforms, has gained some momentum in recent weeks with large rallies featuring Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders. Shri Thander is also in the mix but viewed with deep skepticism by some liberals, who question his progressive credentials."
2018-11-10,Daily Beast,Trump Blames California Fires on Mismanagement as Death Toll Climbs,"Before authorities even had a chance to identify the bodies of residents burned beyond recognition in Northern Californias most destructive fire ever early Saturday, President Trump took it upon himself to place blame for the costly blaze, railing against gross mismanagement of the forests.

Residents and survivors of the so-called Camp Firewhich incinerated the entire town of Paradise and at least nine people in it since it erupted Thursdayexpressed disgust at Trumps remarks on social media, with many questioning why the president had failed to even acknowledge the victims or the thousands of firefighters risking their lives to stop the blaze and get people to safety.

Pop star Katy Perry joined in the chorus of condemnation, blasting Trumps tweet as an absolutely heartless response.

There arent even politics involved. Just good American families losing their homes as you tweet, evacuating into shelters, she wrote on Twitter.

In his first public comments on the fire, the president also took matters a step further, threatening to pull federal funding to deal with the aftermath of the inferno just hours after signing an emergency declaration to provide federal aid.

Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! he warned.

California fire officials have previously disputed the presidents claims that bad management is behind a rise in wildfires and argued that climate change is the real perpetrator.

As of Saturday, at least 35 people were still missing as a result of the Camp Fire, and the blaze was only 20 percent contained after scorching 100,000 acres of land. More than 6,450 homes were completely destroyed in one town alone. But California fire officials warned that the rest may be yet to come, with a red flag warning and critical fire weather expected throughout the weekend.

Residents have described an apocalyptic scene.

It was raining black pieces of soot, coming down like a black snowstorm and starting fires everywhere, Marc Kessler, a teacher in Paradise, told The Washington Post. Within minutes, the town was engulfed.

Jody Jones, the mayor of Paradise, told CNN there were very few homes still standing after the fire ravaged the town. Theres really not much left, she said.

The destruction wasnt limited to Northern California. The Hill and Woolsey fires paved a path of destruction through the lavish, celebrity homes of Malibu and other Ventura County communities, including Thousand Oaks, where many residents are still reeling from the mass shooting earlier this week that killed 12.

Two deaths were reported in Malibu, though authorities have yet to confirm if they were related to the fire.

As of Saturday, fire officials said at least 150 homes had been destroyed in the Southern California fires. The Woolsey fire was at 0 percent containment Saturday, while the Hill fire was 25 percent contained.

Many residents reportedly fled to the sands of Zuma Beach to escape the flames around Malibu, even as the sky above the Pacific turned black from all the smoke.

This fire is like Armageddon, Malibu resident Charlie Dresser told the San Diego Union-Tribune. Its out of control."
2018-09-28,Daily Beast,Snookered The Nap Features the Worst British Accents on Broadway,"With only a few exceptions, the attempted Yorkshire and wherever-else-theyre-supposed-to-be-from-in-Britain accents in the Manhattan Theatre Clubs production of Richard Beans The Nap fail miserably, by which I mean (with a hard gaze) they are truly atrocious. This critic writes that as the son of a Yorkshireman and a Brit.

The accents of the American cast spring forth like malfunctioning bathroom taps: Perhaps that wont matter to an American audience (although my theater buddy noticed the tonal weirdness if it). The attempt and fail made this critic wince almost to the point of standing up and pleading for the aural hell unfolding on stage to stop.

One voice started in America, briefly went to the East End of London, then Scotland, and settled on a kind of strangulated American-Mancunian. Another initially opted for Downton Abbey posh, segued to Dick Van Dyke (Mary Poppins edition), tried to go oop-North, and then devolved into an indecipherable growl.

This accent potpourri was off-putting enough, before we get to this strange play, itself an off-putting mash-up of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Beans deserved hit One Man, Two Guvnors (which came to Broadway, becoming a hit starring James Corden), and a Ray Cooney farce.

It is set in the world of snooker (another favorite game of this critic, who started playing it as a young boy) and begins in the knackered confines of a snooker room of a Royal British Legion club in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

The nap on a snooker table is the bunching of fibers running against the smooth direction of the baize, which can affect the speed and direction of the balls. And so, I guess, the play seeks to animate humorously the characters and activities around the game upsetting its smooth running; these are the non-diamonds in snookers rough.

The choice of city is significant. In this dingy room, our hero, Dylan Spokes, is practicing before trying to win the World Snooker Championship at Sheffields famous Crucible Theatre. There, in the 1980s, one of the most famous snooker matches of all time took place, the World Snooker Championship Final between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor, which went to 17 frames all, and in the match-deciding final 35th frame, the game went down to the final black, earning the matchs nickname of the Black Ball Final.

Taylor, and his huge eyeglasses, won in a match watched by more than 18 million Brits. The game doesnt enjoy that TV popularity now, but the World Championships are still staged in Sheffield (and have been since 1977; the event is worth a reported $6.6 million to the city itself). When it premiered in Britain in 2016, The Nap was also staged at the Crucible.

There is a brief summary of snooker rules in the play; necessary, as the game never took off in America as it did in Britain. Sadly, the full-length table (for a snooker fan like myself, that delicious green baize is so near yet so far) is only used twice in the play.

Is it like pool? I was asked before the play. Well, yes-ish, but mainly no. The idea of snooker: Both players are aiming to pot the same balls, not two sets of different ones. Pot all the reds first, after each red pot a color.

The reds stay in the pocket; the colors re-emerge from the table pockets after each pot. When there are no more reds, work your way through the colors until you end up with the black. The maximum break (uninterrupted play) in snooker is 147, potting a black after every red ball, and then all the colors in order.

You can accrue extra points by ""snookering"" your opponent, obstructing their progress to hit their target ball by placing the white cue ball behind other balls. If your opponent fails to swerve or bounce their ball off a cushion and hit its desired target, you score an extra four points.

This is less a play about the game and more a woolly tale of match fixing (which has become part of the contemporary game) and shady foreign syndicates.

The target of it all is poor Dylan, upstanding, handsome, and the only sane and level person on stage (and, in the handsome and frazzled Ben Schnetzer, the best actor in the production), as he heads to the big final, and with a threat to throw a frame of it or else.

Everyone apart from Dylan is a cartoon version of an existing cartoon stereotype: his dad (John Ellison Conlee) is a gravelly voiced, ponderous loafer, his mother (Johanna Day) is a stereotypical Northern tart (all tight dresses, carelessness, and venality).

Dylan has a colorfully suited manager (Gordon Moore), shiftily on the phone to foreign lands. The two cops who come to investigate matters are comically inept. A fair few of these characters are not who they seem. This, sadly, doesnt add to them dramatically.

The Naps chief antagonist is a transgender gangster named Waxy Bush (haha, not) played by trans actor and activist Alexandra Billings. The script includes phrasing like when she was a man and sex change, and Waxys gender identity, if not the butt of jokes, still seems like an exploitatively conceived cul-de-sac.

The play snickers to itself about it. Her lack of a hand and her malapropisms (many, relentless, ultimately exhausting) are seen as jokes in themselves. Yes, Waxy is strong and assertive, but she also seemed (to me at least) an insultingly drawn, all too familiar fictional trans psychopath.

But she is not alone struggling in the uneven comic folds of The Nap. The characters are so broadly drawn or hapless that you cant root for them, you cant dislike them, you dont really know them; the plot merely drags them through multiple complications from point A to a kind of incomplete point R. The plays romantic denouement makes as little sense as its dramatic one, because the coupling itself makes little sense.

If this critics body and mind were wracked with a thousand shades of cringe, it recovered slightly with the best bits of The Nap, and for a snooker fan, this almost made the evening bearable: the playing of actual snooker.

At these moments the stage opens up to evoke the Crucible itself. We see the snooker table in full on a screen above the stage, as Dylan and a professional player (Ahmed Aly Elsayed, playing the roles of Dylans two opponents) take up cues.

Its lovely to see a game unfold, even if the slices of match we see are pre-plotted. There is still an apparent element of risk if Dylan doesnt pot the balls hes supposed towhich would be fairly impossible in the final game, as the colored balls are placed dead over the pockets.

These briefly played matches give The Nap its only sense of dramatic frisson, and at least inspired me after this misfiring play to go straight home to watch what had been committed to YouTube of that astonishing Taylor-Davis match of 1985.

The Nap is at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, 261 West 47th Street, New York City. Booking to Nov. 11."
2018-11-30,Daily Beast,Joy Behar Fires Back at Kid Rock for Calling Her a Bitch on Fox News,"Did he call me a bitch? Joy Behar asked after The View played the clip of Kid Rock talking about her on Fox & Friends this morning.

Yes, he most certainly did.

During an appearance with Steve Doocy, an admittedly intoxicated Kid Rock said,  The division in the country right now, its so hard for people just to get past that we can disagree and still be cordial with one another... God forbid you say something a little wrongyoure racist, homophobic, Islamophobic. He then added, And I would say love everybody, except Id say screw that Joy Behar bitch. Everybody but that!

Laughing, Doocy quickly said, You cannot say that and apologized on behalf of the show.

Yes, co-host Sunny Hostin said, answering Behars question. And you come for one of us, you came for all of us, Kid Rock!

Well, all I can say is, this bitch and these bitches will be happy to have you on the show and have a beer, Behar said. Come on down.

Abby Huntsman, who used to co-anchor Fox & Friends, commended Doocy for how he dealt with the situation live in the moment. I thought the way he handled it in that moment to apologize and say this should not be said, she said. I've been in those moments where someone called former President Obama a racist on the air. You have to react in those moments because it doesnt represent who you are. Its important to point out that they handled it well.

What is it about me that he feels he needs to say that though? Behar asked, seeming taken aback by the whole thing. Who am I? I'm just a comedian on a show. Why doesnt he go after the big shots? Why me?

After calling Behar a very powerful voice, Meghan McCain said, I don't agree with calling any woman a bitch for having a political opinion, adding, people do it to me all the time. She then led her co-hosts in making fun of Kid Rocks real name: Bob.

Listen, I'm having a difficult week, Behar, who celebrated her 20-year anniversary co-hosting The View this week, said later. Too much attention on me. Yesterday was a whole big thing. Today it's another. I can't take it.

But she did see the upside in the fact that Fox News finally had to apologize for something. Or as McCain put it: That should be your 20th anniversary gift, Fox having to apologize to you."
2018-05-05,Daily Beast,Bill Maher Goes Off on Rudy Giuliani and Trump Theyre Both Fckin Senile,"Its been a very, very bizarre week.

On Wednesday night, Rudy Giulianiwhos spent all of two weeks as a member of President Trumps legal teamappeared on Sean Hannitys Trump Pravda program and claimed that Trump fired FBI Director James Comey because he would not say that he wasnt a target of the investigation, and that Trump not only funneled the Stormy Daniels hush money through a law firm, but that the president repaid it. This, of course, ran contrary to claims made by both President Trump and his attorney/fixer Michael Cohen that Trump was unaware of the payoff in the final weeks of the presidential election.

If that werent enough, The New York Times reported on Friday night that Trump indeed knew about the Daniels payment months before Giulianis Fox News reveal.

So Rudy Giuliani, as you know, replaces Michael Cohen. That was his lawyer. So, Rudys in for Michael Cohen. Hes traded a lawyer who carries a bat for a lawyer who turns into one, joked Bill Maher during his Real Time monologue Friday night.

And Rudy had a very rough beginning, he continued. Admitted that Trump fired Comey because of the Russia investigation; admitted that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payoff; admitted that Trump knew about the hush money to Stormy Daniels. I think the person that needs money to hush is Rudy.

Maher was completely beside himself with Giulianis Hannity reveal(s), including the claim that Trumps Daniels moneywhich he alleges to have no knowledge ofwere included as part of Cohens $35,000 monthly retainer.

This is a brilliant legal strategy called confessing, Maher joked. So, according to Rudy, heres what were supposed to believe: that Trump has a default arrangement with his lawyer that if any porn star anywhere in America that I banged in a golf club says she did, you dont have to check with me, just pay her.

And Trump has repeatedly tried to walk back Giulianis Hannity statements, which caught Maher by surprise.

You know youve hit rock bottom when Trump is cleaning up your quotes, said Maher. Theyre both fuckin senile. Guys, you gotta write your lies down! You know how it is at that age. Sometimes, you walk into a room and you forget what lie you came in there for."
2018-02-13,Daily Beast,Salon Wants to Borrow Your Computer to Mine Cryptocurrency,"If you want to read Salon and you dont want to deal with ads, youll have to agree to get into the cryptocurrency business.

On Sunday night, the famously liberal site began testing a new formula: If non-subscribers using ad-blocking software want to read the publication, theyll dedicate part of their processing power to help Salon mine Monero, a popular cryptocurrency.

We want to be able to take a little bit of control back, Salon CEO Jordan Hoffner told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. And I cant wait for someone else to come up with a solution for me. So we did it ourselves.

As digital advertising revenue has brought in less revenue than many digital media organizations have hoped, some outlet have begun experimenting with how blockchain technology can improve and help fund newsrooms.

Mining cryptocurrency is essentially a way of agreeing to share your computers processing space on the blockchain platform, the technological backbone of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies rely on processors to solve complex mathematical calculations to approve transactions, which is how users to win or mine currencies. Larger user poolslike the one Salon is experimenting withincrease the chance of solving the equations and winning currency.

According to the company, Salon has enlisted or pooled readers computers to mine Monero, a privacy-focused coin, and other cryptocurrencies.

The site laid out what it views as strict rules of operation: It would only mine cryptocurrencies while users are on the Salon page, and would require users to opt in every 24 hours.

Though Hoffner would not release specifics, the CEO said mining cryptocurrency will yield a number of benefits for the publications actual journalism. Longform reporting would be encouraged, he claimed, as the outlet could potentially mine more currency if users spend longer periods of time viewing the site.

Hoffner said that the site would build a portfolio of cryptocurrencies, and then figure out what we want to do with it, eventually turning some into dollars.

Several experts like New York University finance professor David Yermack said that although the idea was interesting, there were obvious drawbacks.

He pointed out to The Daily Beast, via email, that mining has the tendency to slow down computers, using a lot of energy, and could put wear on an individuals machine by using extra processing.

Further, it may not be a particularly lucrative revenue stream.

A small network of users with ad-blocking software installed likely would not yield significant returns or compete with larger, more advanced crypto-mining operations. Advanced and increasingly sophisticated cryptocurrency mining operations have thrived in countries with access to cheap power (Hoffner said he was aware of the potential environmental impact of encouraging Salons eco-friendly readership to use more energy).

Overall, this is a pretty inefficient way to mine cryptocurrency compared to locating next to a hydroelectric dam or geothermal source of abundant, essential free electricity, Yermack said.

Salon CEO Hoffner said the company has not experienced security issues, and is not worried about the current user experience, noting that the website first tested the mining tactics on its own staff, their friends, and their families. Hoffner further noted that he did not experience a considerable slowdown.

I was listening to Sonos, doing a Powerpoint presentation, chatting on iMessage, and watching a YouTube video all at once, and I saw no discernable difference, he asserted.

The CEO emphasized that the companyone of the oldest digital-media news publicationsneeded to experiment to stay afloat in an increasingly volatile media market.

Were trying something innovative to combat a problem that's going to get bigger and bigger, Hoffner said. Maybe it's works, maybe it doesn't, but it's worth a shot."
2018-04-24,Daily Beast,Kate and William Had Their Third Child Why and What Were We Watching,"On Monday evening, hours after Kate Middleton had given birth to her newborn son and posed outside the Lindo Wing of St. Marys Hospital in London holding him, the media were heavily in decoding mode.

As royalty is largely symbolicand royal births are definitely at the most pronounced and weird end of symbolic public exercises, with town criers and royal devotees dressed up in the Union Jack and waiting outside the hospital in feverish anticipationyou can forgive the media race to the archives to find that Princess Diana had worn a red-colored outfit when presenting Prince Harry to the world in 1984.

On Monday, Kate Middleton wore a red dress when presenting her as-yet-unnamed third child to the world. This, then, was a tribute to Princess Diana; especially as Princess Diana wore a dress with dots when presenting Prince William to the world, and Kate wore a Jenny Packham polka dot dress when presenting Prince George to the world.

Sure, both women were standing on the steps of the Lindo Wing, but it is apparently inconceivable that Kate Middleton can wear dresses devoid of any symbolic importance.

Of course, symbols flourish to the benefit of both the royals and the media. The Cambridges likely want to say little and look as good as possible, and thenlike any couple who have just had a babyget the hell home. Yet posing outside the hospital is necessary for the royals: Its the mission accomplished money shot. The royal line continues, and heres the happy, dimply truth of it all. The media are the ever-faithful recorders.

Kate and William are surrounded by security and unimaginable privilege, so ones sympathy is qualified by thatbut it still must be very strange and stressful to know that as soon as you have given birth, you must be made over to look media-ready to present your child to the world.

Just as hawkishly observed as the royal couple Monday was the presence of stylists and hairdressers.

The pressure to look good enough for media consumption hours after giving birth seems particularly perverse. Just what kind of society demands fashion perfection from anyone hours after they have given birth?

The Independent has its own, now well-practiced take on the media madness of such days as Monday. Its headline was Woman Gives Birth to Baby Boy. It doesnt care, you see. But then it published another six stories about the birth, so it does seem to care.

What also happened Monday was a piece of public theater that once again showed the grotesque public ownership of Kate Middletons body. Her size and clothes are monitored on a daily basis. And so the birth of a child, what should be a private day for most humansand the loved ones they choose to be withinstead becomes yet another public engagement because Kate and Williams children are not just royals, they are the ones most adjacent to the throne.

The media, much as they want these children to look cute to sell newspapers, also need them as new characters in the royal soap opera. This child, we were told all day Monday, is fifth in line to the throne, displacing Prince Harry to sixth.

Much has been said about Prince William and Kate Middletons comparative laziness when it comes to carrying out royal public engagements. Much has been said about their desire for privacy. Some of the criticisms are fair. They have all they could wish for, and they are cosseted and protected to an unimaginable degree. They are the new generation of a privileged institution; they need the public to love them in order for the Firm to survive.

But they and their children are also living in the strangest goldfish bowl. Kates body and baby are royal vessels just as so many royal wives before her, given over not just to building a family for her and her husband but to the maintenance of a historic, class-streaked institution. The royals needed Mondays photo call as much as the media; two different purposes were served.

Kate and Williams children are theirs, and they are also not just theirs but part of a grander planand the country watches on as they grow, just as they did with the queen, and her children, and now her childrens children and their children.

Imagine your water breaking, and that being announced as a breaking news story. Imagine being in labor and giving birth, while knowingbeyond the effort and emotional and physical toll of thatthat you are expected to be blow-dried, primped, made up, and looking media-ready hours later.

Somehow, for some reason, a royal birth becomes a model to emulate when it really shouldnt. There are a lot of helpers keeping the royal show on the road. We should judge itthe happy smiles, the dress, the makeup, the hair, the cool and easy dad-ness of William, the lovely picture of heterosexual coupledom in full, complete bloomas equal parts joyous and surreal spectacle, not as template.

We should be happy for Prince William and Kate Middleton. But we should also grimace at the circus a day like Monday has become, and the ultimately misogynistic meaning of what the circus is. A woman gave birth, and then her body and baby were given up to the watching world.

What do the photographs really show? A happy family, one hopes. Also: a royal wifes body that is her own, and not simply her own. A baby that is her own, and not simply her own. And now shed quite like to go home, thanks very much."
2018-02-10,Daily Beast,Cross-Country Skiing 2018 Olympics Full Schedule and How to Watch,"Are you ready to see some serious endurance? The 2018 Winter Olympic Cross-Country Skiing competition will kick off on Saturday, Feb. 10, at 2:15 a.m. ET. The women will start off the day (or end yours) with a 7.5km + 7.5km Skiathlon followed by the mens 15K skiathlon on Sunday, Feb. 11 at 1:15 a.m. ET. Qualification rounds kick off on Tuesday, Feb. 13 at 3:30 a.m. ET.

Watching the athletes compete is a good way to learn how to cross-country ski but it certainly is not easyand some would prefer to come down sick than attempt the race. Cross-country skiing is the oldest type of skiing, according to the official Olympics pages and involves skiing across longer and shorter distances on country terrain. The athletes use their body strength to propel them forward instead of the velocity of a track or slopewhich is as rough as it sounds. Dont believe us? The New York Times agrees: Cross-country skiing is where the elegant majesty of winter sports goes to die an excruciatingly drawn-out death, it wrote.

But it also explains why the sport is still watched and celebrated because, simply, its really grueling and anyone who can endure it deserves to be applauded.

Norway has dominated this sport throughout history, which isnt surprising considering cross-country skiing originated in the country: first as a ski festival and then a stand-alone cross-country competition. The last time Americans won a medal in cross-country skiing was 1976 but that isnt demotivating Team USA. Sadie Bjornsen, Jessie Diggins and Kikkan Randal are all preparing to hit that podium. For now, theyll hit the snow.

Heres the schedule of cross-country skiing events and how you can tune in.

2018-08-24,Daily Beast,Right-Wing Site Tied to Kelli Ward Pulls Article Criticizing the GOP Senate Candidate,"A popular right-wing news outlet has removed a story from its website that was critical of a U.S. Senate candidate whose campaign is paying the sites owner.

The site, Big League Politics, published a story on this month based on a video of Republican Arizona senate candidate Kelli Ward singing karaoke at a bar in Lake Havasu, Arizona. The story was headlined U.S. Senate Candidate from Arizona Filmed Rapping While Drunk at Swingers Bar, and asked, Do we want to send this act to D.C.?

That story no longer appears on BLPs website, and its web address redirects to the sites homepage. Web archive data indicates it was removed within a day of its publication.

Peter DAbrosca, the storys author, said the piece was removed from the site because it didnt comport with its editorial standards.

Once we learned the video was produced ham handedly by a consultant with a personal vendetta against Kelli Ward and included baseless claims against her we did something the Daily Beast rarely doeswe got the story write [sic], DAbrosca told The Daily Beast. He declined to name the consultant.

But the story also fell smack dab in the middle of a web of political dealings that have complicated the sites editorial posture in recent months.

BLPs owner, Mustard Seed Media, is a consulting firm run by Republican operative Reilly ONeal. The Ward campaign has paid two of ONeals other companies, email vendor Rightside Lists and fundraising firm Capital Square Funding Group, about $108,000 this year in fundraising commissions and email revenue-sharing fees.

Indeed, BLPs history is uniquely entwined with the fight over the U.S. Senate nomination in Arizona. The site was founded in early 2017 by Dustin Stockton, a conservative activist who was an early senior official on the Ward campaign. But Stockton and his girlfriend, fellow Ward staffer Jennifer Lawrence, had a falling out with Ward and her husband, and Stockton and Lawrence publicly disavowed their former employer before joining the campaign of former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is running against Ward for the Republican Senate nomination.

Alerted to BLPs deletion of the Ward story, Stockton laid into the site he once led. Its pathetic that a project that I designed to be a journalistic endeavor has become just another tool of the consulting class, he told The Daily Beast in an email. They should change their name to bush league politics, that is more accurate.

Mustard Seed acquired BLP after the special election for U.S. Senate in Alabama late last year. In that campaign, the losing candidate, former Republican state supreme court justice Roy Moore, paid ONeals companies nearly $1 million. Moores Twitter account, with its roughly 75,000 followers, was subsequently rebranded as the official BLP account.

Since then, ONeal and another consultant involved with Big League, Noel Fritsch, have also picked up work on behalf of Republican Senate candidate Corey Stewart, who has simultaneously received glowing coverage from BLP.

Corey Stewart Bashes Wimpy Tim Kaine Over Antifa Son and Sandinista Support, read a quintessential headline on a story authored, as it happens, by DAbrosca.

The site has grown in popularity of late under the leadership of editor in chief Patrick Howley, a former Breitbart writer who has steered BLP firmly into the fever swamps of the right-wing web. The site is a booster of the fringey QAnon movement, a vast conspiracy theory stretching from ancient Greece to the contemporary American deep state. It has promoted claims that Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered by U.S. federal agents in 2016 due to his involvement in the hacking of DNC email accounts, and questioned widely accepted reports of chemical weapons attacks by the Syrian government, among other dubious writings.

Despite that checkered history, DAbrosca says his Ward article was not removed due to any financial pressures.

Two days after he published his short-lived Ward story, DAbrosca wrote another piece on the Arizona senate race, but this one struck a very different note. Ward has consistently supported the President and his agenda, the same one supported by America First voters, DAbrosca wrote. Ward is clear: she wants to Make America Great Again.

A couple weeks later, Howley took to Twitter to bemoan news organizations that hide information from their readers at the behest of friends and acquaintances.

The problem I had as a reporter was getting shut down by smug, clueless D.C. establishment millenial [sic] middle managers and deputy editors. Those people are dumb as rocks and only care about blocking info for their fancy friends, Howley wrote.

At Big League Politics, he said, writers are in control."
2018-06-17,Daily Beast,The Rum Decade Chronicling the Spirits Explosive Growth,"A dozen years ago there were two American craft distilleries focusing on rum: Celebration Distilling in New Orleans, and Prichards Rum in Kelso, Tennessee. I visited both while researching my book, And a Bottle of Rum: A History of the New World in 10 Cocktails. And when the book was published in the summer of 2006 I could rest well, knowing I had done my homework and had included everything anyone could possibly need to know about modern American rums.

It was the best of timing. It was the worst of timing.

Good timing because the book came out just as the cocktail renaissance blossomed, and as the craft spirits boom was gaining momentum. A new crop of bartenders, distillers, and serious tipplers wanted to know more about rum, and, lo, here was a book for them. It sold steadily and well.

But it was also the worst of timing: the final chapter, which focused on modern rum, instantly became a yellowing snapshot of a distant era. Two craft rum distilleries? Quaint! Zacapa as the most premium of rums? Well, when I wrote that Zacapa was still largely a cult rum aged 23 yearsbefore it was acquired by Diageo, which dropped the age statement and turned it into a mass-market, super-premium rum.

So last year my publisher and I agreed that the book could use a refresh. (We also agreed that refresh could be used as a noun.) So I combed through the book, brushed out the burrs, and recast the last chapter such that it was relatively up to date, circa late 2017. The revised version just came out.

In the original edition, I laid out a story arc I thought neatly tracked rums history through its first four centuries. It was essentially the story of rums rise (1640-1800), its fall (1800-1920), and its return (1920 to 2006). At heart, this was the classic heros journey, wherein our hero (rum) sets off from humble circumstances on 17th century islands and with a rusting sword in hand to take on the bigger world. Rum faces many challenges and setbacks along the way (pirates, Prohibitionists, whiskey), and eventually comes home to the islands in a somewhat diminished state, but poised to regain power in the 21st century.

So I wondered: what was rums story over the past dozen years? How did the tale turn out? Whats emerged is a subplot built around another archetype: the heroic search for an elusive elixir.

This elixir saga has been surprisingly epica whole army has since been conscripted. The ranks of rum-producers have swelled hugely since 2016. The two producing in 2006 were artist James Michalopoulos, who had had founded Celebration Distilling as a celebration of Louisiana sugar cane, and Phil Prichard, who launched his Tennessee rum in a quest to define an all-American rum, as distinct from its West Indian relatives.

And now? A couple of months ago I compiled a list of American distillers currently producing rum. I came up with 217 distillers, although Im sure I overlooked quite a few. I turned up rum distillers in 42 states plus the District of Columbia. Leading the pack was California with 25 rum makers, followed by Florida with 18 and Pennsylvania with 15.

While the West Indies still dominates rum production (hello, Bacardi!), the search for the elixir has lured out recruits in unusual places that might make you scratch your head in confusion. Mountainous Colorado had 11 distillers making rum, and far-from-the-Caribbean Washington and Oregon had 20 between them. I recall speaking with one aspiring distiller in New Mexico, and asked him how he was going to market a product associated with tropical islands when he was in the high desert West. Well, he explained, the Rio Grande begins near here and empties into the Gulf of Mexico. So the way we see it, it took 400 years for rum to return to the headwaters.

In other words, an epic.

In the past dozen years, the styles of rum available have also grown significantly. That includes the funky rums traditionally made in Jamaica, brimming with a high ester content, like Smith & Cross, Hamilton Rums, The Funk Jamaican Rum, and the new high-end aged variants imported by Habitation Velier. Even some craft rum distillers have embraced the quest for dunder-funk, like Roulaison Rum in New Orleans, creating powerfully aromatic rums with a 55-gallon drum and more than a passing knowledge of microbial fermentation.

Agricole rumstraditionally, French-style rums made from fresh sugar canewere a curious anomaly a decade ago, hard to find and regarded with suspicion. Today, theyre sought out in the American market by those eager for a taste of the cane field. Again, American craft rum producers have followed along in the last few years, experimenting with this style in cane-growing areas like Louisiana, Texas, and Hawaii. This is not something I could have predicted 12 years ago.

Other rum styles that have expanded in recent years include what might be dubbed American-style rumsmade stateside, and drier than their island cousins, designed to appeal to bourbon drinkers. And spiced rums continue to grow, with some of the better, newer entrants less dependent on the big vanilla notes that dominates the mainstays, and instead drawing on local flavorings and spices, such as citrus peel and hot peppers. I find it harder to be dismissive of spiced rums.

Every advancing army attracts camp followersa cadre of hangers-on seeking easy profit along the margins. Of the 217 rum distillers, I found fifty that focused either solely or largely on rum. The others often produced rum as an adjunct to their main focus of gin or whiskey or vodka, and I often find these secondary rums of questionable qualityharsh, hot, scarcely fit to be mixed with Coke, yet still priced like a premium product. These makers have usually carved out a local niche, sell directly to their friends and neighbors, and count on regional consumer pride to sustain sales. Its easy to sell the first bottle. Its the second bottles thats tough. Were just beginning to see fallout from this, as the quest for the elixir invariably involves sacrifice as lesser characters perish from starvation.

For all this swashbuckling and adventure, rum remains on the cusp of a more epic battle. Numerous craft rums have been assembling outside the gates of the Legacy Rum Castle, occupied by the large, longtime producers, sending occasional arrow over the parapets of the old-line producers, harrying but not yet invading.

The well-established rums dont seem terrifically worried. They know the ramparts and fortifications will keep the usurpers at bay: volume, economy of scale and competitive pricing, and longstanding connections with distributors, who are fewer in number than they were in 2006.

The average craft distiller, according to the American Craft Spirits Association, makes around 3,600 cases annually. Lets generously assume there are 300 rum distillers each making that much. That totals just over a million cases of rum a year. Impressive, but still Lilliputian when compared with the hemispheres largest rum maker, Bacardi, which sells 17 million 9-liter cases each year. (Captain Morgan moves 10 million.)

And while the big distillers may not have boiling oil to pour on the invaders, they have something more effective: lawyers who sally out against the best positioned challengers with fistfuls of cash and acquisition agreements.

Whos winning? Im pretty sure I know the answerits the rum drinker. Not in generations have fans of sugar cane in a bottle had so many optionswhether rums produced by large, little or medium sized makers, in all styles and qualities.

The search for the magic elixir, it turns out, doesnt require much heroism these days. Just a trip to your local bar or liquor shop.

And that, my friends, is the rest of the story."
2018-05-09,Daily Beast,Former Student Says She Was Sexually Abused by Principal for Years Now She Wants Justice,"A woman says the former principal of her high school began sexually abusing her when she was a 14-year-old studentbut school officials failed to adequately investigate evidence of his misconduct, and the abuse to continued.

Mark Fisher, a former principal at the Academy of Arts & Academics, befriended, groomed, and sexually abused the student from 2006 and 2010, according to a $5 million federal lawsuit she filed against the Springfield School District, former superintendent Nancy Golden, and former human resources director Roger Jordan on Monday.

The woman, who is referred to as Jane Doe in the lawsuit, says she was 14 years old when Fisher, some thirty years older than her, initiated an inappropriate relationship that became sexual. Shes suing the school district for a loss of bodily integrity and for negligence.

Officials at the Academy of Arts & Academics, known locally as A3, knew about Fishers behavior as early as 2007 and never told the girls parents nor interviewed her, the Register-Guard reported in March.

Her parents are irate. If they had known [then] or any of the years about any of this, they wouldve put an end to it, Barbara Long, the womans attorney, told The Daily Beast.

Fisher, who killed himself in February after the sexual-abuse allegations came to light, threatened the student, telling her that no one would believe her story if she spoke out, Long said. As a result, the girl lived in fear, she said.

He said, No one will believe that you, or any of your accolades, are legitimate. He would tell her hes going to kill himself, Long said.

She wanted to protect the school she loved, A3. She even kept it a secret from her husband, the attorney added.

Doe kept the alleged abuse hidden for years, even after she returned to work at the school in the fall of 2014. She moved to Georgia in 2016.

The allegations finally came to light in late January after a teacher overheard a student repeating a rumor that Fisher had been having sex with students, according to the Register-Guard.

The teacher reported the accusation to her superiors and Springfield School District administrators. Springfield police launched an investigation into the matter, contacting Doe, who came forward about the abuse she suffered, according to the lawsuit.

Mike Fisher took advantage of me from the time I was 14 years old, she told police, according to the Register-Guard.

Fisher was placed on leave on Jan. 31. He committed suicide the next day.

Doe says the school had ample cause to believe that Fisher was abusing her when she was a student. In 2007, one of her friends saw her place her hand on Fishers thigh and spotted them holding hands. That friend told her mom what shed seen, the Register-Guard reported.

But when the parent confronted Fisher, he brushed off her concerns, claiming he was counseling Doe, who came from a dysfunctional family. As the mother left his office, she overheard the principals secretary say his relationship with Doe was going to ruin this program.

That parent also told Walterville Elementary School teacher Sherrie Warthen about the suspicious behavior. Warthen filed a complaint with the school district, and told her husband, a detective, about the allegation. According to the Register-Guard investigation, Fisher told Jordan, the schools former human resources director, that he never touched the girl inappropriately, calling her a bit clingy.

According to the lawsuit, Fisher was simply given a warning letter. The letter stated that an investigation found no evidence that child abuse, in any form, took place.

Fisher was given a Letter of Instruction/Directive that he follow Springfield School District s transportation policy and stay in public areas with students, the lawsuit states. Plaintiffs parents were never notified about the Letter to Fisher or about the 2007 complaint, Plaintiff was never interviewed, and no further steps were taken to enforce the Letter.

The abuse continued, on and off school grounds, until Doe graduated in 2010, the lawsuit states.

Defendant created a dangerous condition by failing to adequately investigate the allegations that Fisher had engaged in an inappropriate relationship with Plaintiff, by failing to report suspected child abuse, and by retaining Fisher as the Principal and a teacher at A3 after learning of credible allegations against him, the lawsuit states.

In March 2018, after the school launched an inquiry into Fishers behavior, Jordan accused Superintendent Golden, who retired in 2012, of telling him to drop the investigationan allegation she denies.

I never directed, asked, or in any way suggested, that Mr. Jordan refrain from any investigation related to Michael Fisher, Golden told the Register-Guard. Any statement or suggestion that I did so is entirely false.

Rumors about Fishers behavior circulated in the halls of A3 for years. You guys should be more aware of the principal having an intimate relationship with a former student. Like this is not a joke and its disgusting, one student wrote in an anonymous survey given out in 2015. The board decided to remove the notes about Fisher before sharing the responses with staff and parents.

This was not a well kept secret, Does attorney said.

The schools charter status was revoked in March, allowing for more oversight of the administration. Springfield Schools Superintendent Sue Rieke-Smith stepped down from her post in April, leaving for another school district.

Mike doesn't represent us. He doesn't represent the school. He doesn't represent the beliefs of anyone at A3. He is not us, student Kyla Ramsey told ABC 9.

Springfield School District spokesperson Jen McCulley told the Register-Guard it will be reviewing with our legal counsel regarding next steps."

2018-08-25,Daily Beast,You Honored Our Deal John McCain Ill Honor Your Legacy,"The news of your imminent departure comes as no surprise given what we know about the disease that is taking you from us. And yet, it still hits on my heart like a ton of bricks.

Not just because of the depth of my respect, reverence and love for you. But because it is dawning on me just how much your voice, clear conscience and moral authority will be missed in the American political arena. There simply is no other John McCain to take your place.

It was the honor of a lifetime to work for you. You always said we should serve a cause greater than ourselves. Thanks to you, for a brief period I did that.

I had come from Bush world, and the team that denied you the presidency. But you never held that against me.

We bonded in the green room of the last presidential debate in 2004, when you hosted President Bush and his team. While we all milled around, I noticed a news story on the television about the selfless soldier Pat Tillman who had left the NFL and a huge salary to serve in the military, and had been killed by friendly fire. His former teammate Jake Plummer had sewn his number onto his jersey in remembrance. The NFL commissioner had come down hard on him, fining him and forcing him to remove the patch. In the news clip, you went off on the commissioner and gave him a classic McCain acid bath.

I approached you, and said, Senator, I just saw this, and wanted you to know I appreciate what you said. I too am a huge fan of Pat Tillman. So much so that after he died, I wanted to make sure I thought of his sacrifice often. And to ensure that I didnt forget, I had his number, 40, tattooed on my shoulder.

You said: Thats bullshit, McKinnon. So I stripped down in the middle of the green room. And when you saw the evidence, you teared up, hugged me, and said, I knew there was a reason I liked you, McKinnon.

When you asked me to work for your presidential campaign a few years later, I said Senator, Ill go mow your lawn in Sedona if thats what you want.

I had one caveat. I had met Senator Barack Obama and though I disagreed with much of his politics, I liked him and thought his candidacy would be good for the country. So I told you that, as unlikely as it seemed in early 2007, that I would step out if you and him ended up running against each other in the general election. I just didnt want to be the tip of the spear attacking Obama, and didnt think I would be the right person under the circumstances.

I think you thought it odd, but assented, particularly because you didnt think it would happen. To make sure you remembered, I wrote a memo to the senior staff of the campaign outlining the agreement.

Then I saddled up, and stayed there when the campaign melted down and most of the staff left. There were just a handful of us left, working for free.

Candidly, I stayed on as volunteer not so much with the notion that you could still win the nomination but simply because I respected you so much and wanted to help regain some of the dignity that had been lost due to the humiliating circumstances of going from well-funded, cant-lose front runner to flat-broke also-ran whod come in third to Mike Huckabee in Iowa.

Those of us who remained were with you as you marched through New Hampshire, completely broke. I remember staying at the cheapest possible hotels, some of them literally under construction.

And then it happened. You won the nomination. You caught lightning in a bottle through your sheer determination and inspiring message of Country First.

And sure enough you had forgotten our deal. So, I brought you the memo. And in classic McCain style, you didnt get angry, you hugged me and said:

Thanks for helping me get here. It would be very un-McCain-like not to keep my word, so God bless you and good luck.

I want you to know, that was one of the hardest things Ive ever done in my life.  To walk away after all the moments from the campaign that I remember and cherish.

We were flying in a small plane that hit some turbulence, and I was showing some white knuckles. Now most people know about your POW experience, but they dont know that you ditched other planes. And in one horrific experience, you were in your plane on the deck of the USS Forrestal when a missile went off accidentally from another plane and hit yours. Your plane exploded and you jumped off the wing onto the deck. The fire engulfed the ship, and 134 people were killed. And yet, even though it was your plane that was directly hit, you somehow survived.

So, when I looked pale in the turbulence, you turned to me and said: McKinnon, dont worry about it. If youre flying with McCain, youre not going to die in a plane.

But the moment that moved me most was the first time I went out on the trail with you. Because of your lean staff at the time, I was doing everything. Whoever had been with you before I showed up handed me a black bag. I looked inside and saw some basic grooming tools, like a hairbrush. But it was only when we arrived at our campaign stop that I realized the purpose.

We were in a van. And we walked out on the side away from the waiting crowd. And you turned to me, a decorated prisoner-of-war survivor, and bent over at the waist in supplication. And then it dawned on me:

You could not comb your own hair. Because of your arms being repeatedly broken as a POW, you could not raise your arms above your shoulders. Then you turned into the crowd. I turned away with tears in my eyes.

In the coming days there will be countless tributes to the brave political stands you took over the years. Your independence was legendary. While I didnt always agree with you, there was never a question in my mind that you always did as you pledged you would and indeed put country first.

Though no one can or will take your place, I hope that as the country pays tribute to your incredible legacy others will be inspired to step up and try to be the next John McCain."
2018-07-12,Daily Beast,Vigilante and Conspiracist Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer Arrested on the Basis of His Own Videos,"Border vigilante Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer was pretty sure he had discovered a stash-house for sex traffickers. Or maybe it was built for a shoot-out with law enforcement.

This is where theyll make a final stand, Meyer said in a video posted online recently, as he and his associates tromp through what appears to be a private Arizona home.

Meyer and allies of his organization, Tucson anti-homelessness group Veterans on Patrol, searched all over the house for proof of the criminal conspiracies they claim exist in the Arizona border region. They hunted through what appeared to be a childs room; they threw open cupboards.

Meyer examined a dirty toilet bowl to get a sense of the last time someone was in the house. At one point, his companions thought theyd discovered an entrance to a secret underground chamber, then realized it was just a drain.

Meyer and his cohort arent members of law enforcement, and theres no evidence in the video that they had permission to be on that property. But Meyer tends to go wherever he wants in pursuit of his self-directed investigations. Then he posts videos.

Now Meyers social media notoriety has caught up with him. On Sunday, deputies from the Pima County Sheriffs Department arrested Meyer on a felony trespassing charge, the result of a complaint they received in June. Meyer and Veterans on Patrol didnt respond to requests for comment.

That case has been helped by Meyers eagerness to post videos which often appear to show him trespassing online.

He was videotaping himself in different areas, Pima County Deputy James Allerton, a department spokesperson, told The Daily Beast. Part of our probable cause was from social media posts.

Meyers videos helped rocket him to fame on the fringe internet right in June after he claimed to have discovered a child sex trafficking camp. Many on the right-wing fringe embraced his claim, using a tenuous connection between Hillary Clinton and the Mexican corporation that owned the land the camp sat on, to further their Pizzagate-style conspiracies. Donations flooded into Meyers group, and his Tucson camp site soon became a gathering place for various militia and conspiracy-theory figures.

Police debunked Meyers allegations, saying the site was just a homeless camp.

Still, Meyer regularly makes up other outlandish claims, which are then also quickly disproven. Even InfoWars founder Alex Jones has denounced Meyer, calling his Tucson operation a honeypot.

Meyers online exploits havent endeared him to police, either. Meyer slammed the trespassing charge in a Facebook post as obvious obstruction and claimed he was more determined than ever, but the trespassing felony may soon be the least of his worries.

A local TV station asked police how many open investigations they have involving Meyer. The answer: several."
2018-02-26,Daily Beast,Republican Governors Outpace Trump on Guns,"After yet another confusing week of Twitter tirades, no one knows what, if any, changes to the nations gun laws President Donald Trump would actually support. But the lack of clear leadership from the top of the GOP isnt stopping the momentum that seems to be building at the state level to re-examine the nations disparate gun lawsand this time, its not just Democrats leading the charge.

Over the weekend, the majority of Americas governors descended on the nations swampy Capitol and gun control was on the top of many of their mindslending an unusual urgency to this staid annual meeting where governors from both parties pretend to put partisan disagreements aside and focus on common ground, like on the low-hanging fruit of infrastructure and education.

The focus on guns was a testament to the powerful teenage voices who have called B.S. on the nations political and lobbying class in the aftermath of the terror, heartbreak, and sorrow that engulfed their high school in Parkland, Florida, after 17 students and adults were gunned down on Valentines Day with a legally obtained assault rifle.

Those tender voices have now become a chorus thats impossible to tune out.

We are entering a new era of activisma new era of citizenship, Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) told a large scrum of reporters while he made a brief stop in Washington. You see these young people and theyre saying, We dont want any political double-talk. And theyre going to change our country. And its great and Im excited about it. And Im optimistic about it. So, the issues not going to go away.

Kasich is open to many of the ideas now being floated around political circles, including one to make it easier for the loved ones of people suffering from mental illnesses to get the courts and law enforcement to intervene and remove guns from what could quickly escalate into another deadly situation inside their homes or in crowded public places.

I mean I think thats something that were going to explore aggressively. Could that happen? It ought to happen, Kasich said. What about the large capacity magazines? Yeah, I would think that thats something we should deal with. To me, I dont think you need to have these large capacity magazines. But where that all translates at the end, I dont know.

That lack of clarity is in part due to Trump himself, who last week seemed to signal a willingness to improve the nations lax background check system, before he appeared to double down on his newfangled plan to train and arm the nations educators.

But many of the nations governorsincluding some high-profile Republicansfind that proposal either outright laughable or terrifyingly dangerous. And theyre starting to take action on their own home turf, with or without the support of Trump and the NRA.

The dominos started to fall when Gov. Rick Scott (R-FL), a fierce conservative and longtime NRA-ally, announced his support for modest new gun restrictions that he would have normally fiercely opposed, including raising the age to purchase a gun to 21.

As Rick Scott was in Florida grappling with the physical and emotional carnage left in the wake of yet another high-profile mass shooting, another Republican governor was also changing his tune on guns. Up in sleepy, picturesque Vermont, Gov. Phil Scott was dealing with his own heart-pounding case involving guns and schoolchildren.

Just before the deadly rampage in Florida, Vermont law enforcement officials were able to stop an 18-year-old from carrying out his own alleged attack that Scott says was eerily similar to Florida.

It was averted due to the brave young woman who came forward with some information that led us, law enforcement, to uncover a plot by a young man to do significant harm in a high school, Scott told The Daily Beast.

After reading the affidavit, the credible good work of law enforcement and others, it led me to do some soul searching in that respect, because I thought we were insulated from this in Vermont, but I learned in a short amount of time that we werent.

Vermonts Republican governor is a proud gun owner and ally of the firearm industry. But at the end of last week, he turned heads when he called on his state legislature to fast-track a bill to temporarily take guns out of the hands of people deemed dangerous. Hes also now open to forcing people under 21 years of age to get training before buying a firearm (yeah, thats currently not on the books in many states).

Phil Scott still remains on the fence on many gun control measures, but he signaled that hell consider signing a bill that his Democrat-controlled legislature is voting on this week that would require universal background checks for gun purchases. While this Republican is still wrestling with how to head off the potential fallout from his gun rights allies locally and nationally, he reports having a change of heart.

Were the safest state in the nation and we probably have some of the least amount of gun laws as well, but, again, my opinion changed after reading the affidavit, Scott added. I would offer that anyone who questions my moving in a different direction should read the affidavit themselves.

The specter of the NRA and even more vocal, and often much more radical, local gun rights groups puts many in the GOP in what they perceive to be a political bind. But some Republican governors are now more willing to buck whats become party orthodoxy on guns.

Theres always political risk, but at the same time were talking about the lives of kids and innocent men and women and people, Gov. Brian Sandoval (R-NV) told a gaggle of reporters in Washington over the weekend.

After dealing with the aftermath of last years Las Vegas massacre, which was the most deadly shooting in modern American history, Sandoval helped usher through gun reforms in Nevada, and reports the debate on guns is changing in other states too.

Its a conversation that has to be had. The status quo isnt working, Sandoval added. Given what happened in Florida and has happened in other places, we need to have that conversation.

Many members of his party still dont want to have that conversation, which many experts say is because of the NRAs stranglehold on the contemporary Republican Party.

This weekend, when The Daily Beast asked Wisconsin governor and failed Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker about gun control, he reverted back to the NRAs usual guidance for responding to mass shootings and went mum.

What do you think about the president calling for arming teachers? The Daily Beast asked as Walker and an entourage of staffers and state troopers made their way to a bank of elevators in the fancy hotel the governors took over, mere blocks from the White House.

So youre not even tuned in to the national debate? The Daily Beast asked.

Im not talking about that, Walker said as he impatiently waited for a slow elevator to whisk him away. Not talking about that right now. No, Im not here as a national figure. Im here as a governor.

Walker may pretend gun violence is a national issue that doesnt touch his state, but a cursory look at Wisconsins history shows thats not the case. In 2012, it was the site of the slaughter of six worshippers at a Sikh temple. And in 2017, when Milwaukee went from being ranked ninth to 15th among Americas most deadly cities, it prompted cheers at home.

Meanwhile, just last week, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island announced a new pact to combat gun violence that includes more information-sharing among law enforcement and more research into next-generation smart gun technology.

The Democratic governors from those states announced their new partnership last week in the aftermath of the Florida slayings, even as gun control advocates despaired at the inaction from Trump and the Republican controlled Congress. But the NRA, Trump, and his GOP surely didnt bank on those highly visible, grieving Florida high school students, who seem to have changed the debateat least for now. Thats why advocates are cautioning patience will likely be needed on any sweeping, national gun reforms.

Ive given up on Congress, newly seated Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) told The Daily Beast. My only hope is with these kids, because our generation has failed. They actually may be the ones to get this done."
2018-03-27,Daily Beast,Virgil Ablohs Vuitton Job Should Be a Breakthrough Moment For Black Fashion Talent,"The fashion industry has been abuzz with the appointment of Off-Whites founder and creative director Virgil Abloh as mens artistic director of Louis Vuitton.

Abloh succeeds Kim Jones, who has become mens director at Christian Dior, which is also owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the parent company of a portfolio of luxury fashion brands including Celine, Givenchy and Fendi.

Abloh is a history maker, because this makes him only the third black designer to ever have a top creative director role at a luxury Parisian fashion house. The other two are Olivier Rousteing, the current creative director of Balmain, and Ozwald Boateng, the former creative director of menswear at Givenchy.

While there was cause to celebrate for Abloh breaking a glass ceiling at Louis Vuitton, there was some that were less than happy with his appointment, as evidenced in comments on websites like Business of Fashion and on Twitter.

These have included, Im all for a more [relevant] Vuitton, but Virgil always seems like a frauddespite his success, a meme that says Well, even Louis Vuitton makes mistakes, and one Reddit user referring to his appointment as a Blatant cash grab, nothing else.""

If there is one thing that Ablohs appointment has proven it is that despite the strides black designers, models and fashion industry professionals have made, the industry still has a big problem in terms of black representation and investing in black talent.

Donnell Baldwin, a fashion stylist whos worked at prestigious companies including Ralph Lauren and Mr Porter, has found this has been an issue in the industry for years.

I think the industry needs to understand that black people and black culture have been leading the charge as it relates to style for years, he says. I remember sitting in board room meetings discussing who brands wanted wearing their clothes and vice presidents and senior vice presidents would name stars, models and performers without even realizing everyone they mentioned was black.

The problem many fashion companies still have with investing in black talent that could become future leaders is that there is also a lack of mentors.

The decision makers, the leaders and executives of these powerhouses need more representation, Baldwin added. I have been the only black person in a room and although it is great because there is some representation, there is still so much more room for us discover more talented leaders in the fashion industry.""

Of the few black power players in the world of high fashion, there is former Vogue editor-at-large Andre Leon Talley, who during the 80s and 90s pushed top designers to have more black models in their shows. He would pave the way for editors like Edward Enninful, the Ghanaian-born current editor-in-chief of British Vogue, who is viewed as the most powerful Black man in fashion.

However, rather than engage in black representation, the industry has long appropriated black culture.

Kylie Jenner once thought it appropriate to wear a durag while sitting front row at a fashion show, and it is all too common for designers to feature tribal inspired clothing from African cultures.

Marc Jacobs made a huge controversy when he sent mostly white models down the runway at his spring/summer 2017 New York Fashion Week show (later admitting it was an insensitive thing to do.)

Sometimes, rather than appropriating black culture, there is an effort to make black entertainers more appealing to European standards of beauty, like when Lupita Nyongos hair was photoshopped on the cover of Grazia.

J. Renfroe, an NYC-based fashion photographer says, Black culture has been very influential on the fashion industry for years, so influential that street wear is now deemed high fashion.

""Unfortunately, cultural appropriation is evident in the industry, but Louis Vuitton is showing appreciation by giving Virgil his platform. Hes definitely paving the way for designers of color.

One could argue that investment in black talent is more essential than ever, because as the Fashion Intellectual Guides editor-in-chief Zoe Monique Cross puts it, They need us now more than ever.

To put it simply, black culture, art and fashion is associated with an immediate cool factor, and it sells.

Black culture is seen as the leader of cool, Cross says. Without us, you arent seen as cool, and its becoming more evident everyday. Fashion houses like Gucci, Dior and Louis Vuitton are working on getting more black people in high ranking positions because we deliver the cool factor.

Despite fashion houses slowly getting on board, many still see a problem with too much complacency in the industry over the lack of black representation.

Conrad Byer, style director at Penn States Valley Magazine says, The heavy European influence within the industry only permits so much progress at a time. Nonetheless, progress is being made.

He added that, We have models such as Shaun Ross who will read a designer to filth for the singular lackluster addition of a model of color on their runway, but where are the white voices speaking out against the inequality? The complacency is infuriating and needs to be addressed on multiple levels.

In terms of industry representation and Black talent not getting further, Nadine Alexandra, editor of Fuzion Mag believes part of the problem is with black celebrities themselves.

Black entertainers continue to wear European designers, and you rarely see black designers being supported, she says. You will see different celebrities at Paris and Milan Fashion Week, and all they wear is European brands. Aside from Tracy Reese and Virgil Abloh, I dont see them wearing anything designed or from a company owned by black people. Its either European designers or something from [popular online site] Fashion Nova.

Alexandra believes to alleviate this problem, celebrities need to start giving the same weight to up and coming black talent that they do to European luxury labels like Gucci. The hope is that Abloh's appointment at Vuitton helps break more barriers to true equality in both fashion boardrooms and on the runways."
2018-09-05,Daily Beast,They Were Indie Rockers With a Bad Reputation Then Their Alleged Victims Spoke Out,"At first, Chicago-based group The Orwells seemed like just a young, charmingly mischievous garage rock band. With scuzzy guitars, half-shouted vocals, and catchy hooks, the groups sound meshed well with the other indie-rock bands of Chicagos booming DIY scene. Founded while its members were still high-schoolers in the Chicago suburb of Elmhurst, The Orwells were often described as a family affair: singer Mario Cuomo (no relation to the ex-New York governor) is the cousin of guitarist Dominic Corso, with twin brothers Grant and Henry Brinner playing bass and drums, respectively, and Matt OKeefe rounding out the lineup on guitar.

While most of their peers in Chicagos indie scene have maintained a relatively low profile, The Orwells quickly gained a reputation for raucous, vulgar live shows. Stripping, sexually suggestive dancing, and the occasional brawl all became hallmarks of The Orwells live performances; for a time, Cuomo was notorious for removing his pants onstage and throwing mics into the crowd.

The band seemed to take their reputation as Chicagos brattiest rockers in stride, however, even titling their most recent album Terrible Human Beings. In an interview with Noisey pegged to the albums release in February 2017, Cuomo acknowledged, Were not the most liked boys on the block, for whatever reason that might be. OKeefe agreed: Back in Chicago we do not have the best reputation around town, he said, adding, We champion the reputation we have.

But a slew of rape and sexual-assault allegations have come to light, belying the bands charmingly impish ethosand eventually leading to their demise.

A tweet from user Riley Kmet (@rileyemmy) last month marked the beginning of the end for the band. The Orwells is a band full of homophobic, transphobic, racist sexual abusers, her tweet read in part. Kmet urged anyone who doubted her claims to message her directly for more details, she told The Daily Beast in an email. Her DMs were soon full of messages from women who allegedly had unsavory, at times predatory, encounters with members of the band and wanted to share their stories.

She and a handful of other women on social media began to compile the allegationsthe most serious of which accuse Cuomo and Henry and Grant Brinner of rape and sexual assault; none accuse Corso or OKeefe of misconductinto a single, shareable Google document that was eventually posted to Reddit.  Once we made the Google document and started sharing it, I began to receive countless messages on Twitter and Facebook, Kmet said. Old friends I had made through Orwells shows and the Orwells fan community online began to come out of the woodwork and share their stories with me.

The document includes nearly 30 pages of screenshots and anonymous testimony, many from accusers who identify as former fans of The Orwells and allege that members of the band victimized or preyed upon them. One woman described Cuomo allegedly taking her virginity in the bands tour van: I was 17 at the time and the night I hooked up with him, he didnt have a condom so we ended up doing anal. While she says the experience was consensual, she emphasized that she was young and starstruck. [Cuomo] didnt ask me, he just kind of did it, she wrote.

Another woman claims Cuomo forcibly kissed her and stuck his hand down her shorts during a show in spring 2014 when she was a junior in high school; yet another claims Grant Brinner assaulted her in the backseat of The Orwells tour van while she was blackout drunk in fall 2014, referring to it as an act of dirty manipulation.

The document also details disturbing allegations of rape and statutory rape against Cuomo , as does an alleged victim who came forward to The Daily Beast but chose to remain anonymous.

The Orwells have denied all allegations of sexual misconduct. In a statement from their manager, the band said, in part, Wed like to first state that sexual abuse in any form is abhorrent. We do not take these accusations lightly and consider this matter incredibly serious. We emphatically deny these baseless allegations brought as a personal attack against us. After acknowledging the bands history of callow altercations and vulgar language, the statement claimed, No member of this band has ever acted without consent or maliciously taken advantage of anyone.

Allegations against Cuomo for soliciting sex from underage fans on Snapchat, and allegations from women who claim they were coerced into performing oral sex on Cuomo or the Brinners at house parties and after-shows comprise the bulk of the document.

Most accusers in the document are anonymous, but a few have gone public with their stories. Kirin Toyota-OBrien took to Instagram to share details of her alleged sexual assault. When I was a freshman in college I was raped by Henry Brinner, Toyota-OBriens account begins. She alleges that after a drunken night out together, Brinner, whom she was casually dating, invited her back to his hotel room. I vividly remember stating that if I were to go home with him that I did not want to have sex. I clearly said no, she wrote.

The last thing Toyota-OBrien remembers, according to the Instagram post, is suggesting to Brinner that they watch a movie. Instead, she claims she woke up the next morning to find herself naked in bed with him. According to Toyota-OBrien, Brinner frequently boasted to mutual friends in subsequent months and years that he made her orgasm during the assault.

When reached for comment by The Daily Beast, Toyota-OBrien said the document and subsequent social media backlash against the band definitely made her feel more comfortable sharing her story on Instagram. After the Google doc was created, it became evident that so many women were deeply and horrifically impacted by these men, Toyota-OBrien said. She called the bands reputation in Chicago public knowledge, but said she still experienced an intense fear speaking out against them.

Madeleine, a 20-year-old based in New York who asked that her last name be redacted, echoed that hesitation. In an email to The Daily Beast, she claimed that during an Orwells show in San Francisco in March 2014, Cuomo repeatedly assaulted her:  Throughout the set, Mario, in front of an entire crowd, choked me, put a microphone between my breasts, and kissed me. She was 15 at the time. The Orwells alleged behavior was common knowledge in our friend group and in our circle of Tumblr friends, so it was talked about privately, Madeleine said. But this was before the age of #MeToo, so no one went public with allegations during the time of these incidents.

Bess Connelly, a 21-year-old from Illinois and co-creator of the Google document, called The Orwells toxic behavior one of Chicagos worst-kept secrets.  I first started hearing stories about the Orwells a few years back, just like most people in the Chicago music community, she wrote in an email to The Daily Beast. She never directly interacted with Orwells members but said the bands reputation wasnt hard to believe, given Mario [Cuomo]s public persona and onstage behavior. After learning that an Orwells show had been scheduled for November at the Chicago concert venue Metro, Connelly said she felt like I needed to do something.

I connected with a few other angry women on Twitter, including Kmet, she wrote, and made a group DM appropriately named Fuck the Orwells to plot together how we could get the Metro show canceled.

On August 27, The Orwells announced that their scheduled hometown show would be canceled out of respect to our friends at the Metro. Two days later, another tweet from the band read simply, The Orwells have disbanded.

Chicago-area bands have been swift to denounce The Orwells in light of the allegations. Jack Dolan, a bassist for the band Twin Peaks, distanced his band from its former tour mates: We dont affiliate, condone or support anything about these dudes, he wrote on Twitter. They have a lot to answer for. A statement on Twin Peaks official Twitter page claims band members were unaware of the Orwells actions during the short time we toured with them, but learned about several incidents through private discussions within the Chicago community in recent years. We never felt it was our place to make public these stories that were not ours to tell.

When reached for comment, former Orwells manager Larry Little said that band members are now speaking only as individuals. The Daily Beast was unable to reach individual members for comment at press time.

Reactions from alleged victims and the women who spearheaded the social media campaign have been mixed.  Seeing that [the Orwells] actually broke up was such a good feeling and felt like such a win, Connelly said in her email. But other women were more ambivalent. Madeleine said she was relieved but felt that the members still need to take accountability.

Kmet shared a similar sentiment in her email to The Daily Beast. Of course, when I first saw the Orwells post saying they disbanded, I was completely stunned and filled with pride that so many women made this possible, she said.

But she was quick to temper her relief: The damage is already done and lives are already permanently changed and traumatized. It makes me wonder if breaking up is enough."
2018-11-22,Daily Beast,Can Cranberries Really Cure UTIs,"Cranberries have held a sacred spot on the Thanksgiving table for centuries, offering a tangy contrast to roast turkey and mashed potatoes.

But every other day of the year, cranberries are revered for another purpose entirely: their purported ability to prevent and cure urinary tract infections, which leave an estimated 50 to 60 percent of women with burning, painful urination at some point in their lifetime.

Proponents claim that cranberries can help prevent UTIs because they have high levels of proanthocyanidins, a chemical which has been linked to a reduction of UTI-causing E. coli bacteria in the urinary tract. Cranberry juice products are thought to cure UTIs because the berry is a diuretic, which helps patients urinate and push more of the bacteria out of their body.

Sounds sensible. But scientific research has cast doubt on these claimsand doctors warn that in some cases, downing cranberry juice in lieu of seeking treatment could lead to serious medical complications.

Despite the hype, the evidence near-overwhelmingly shows that proanthocyanidins (and the cranberry products that contain them) wont do much to prevent UTIs, Manisha Juthani-Mehta, an infectious disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine, told The Daily Beast.

In 2016, Juthani-Mehta published a study of 185 female nursing home patients in the journal JAMA. For a year, 92 of those women received two oral cranberry capsulesthe equivalent of 72 milligrams of proanthocyanidin, or 20 ounces of cranberry juicewhile the other 93 received a placebo.

Her team found no significant differences in the amount of UTIs between the treatment group and the control group.

Those results are damning for proanthocyanidin, Juthani-Mehta said. Most cranberry capsule products on the market have up to 36 milligrams of proanthocyanidinbut Even with double this PAC content (72mg in the capsules we tested), she said, we were unable to show that capsules worked.

Betsy Foxman, director of the Center for Molecular and Clinical Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan, saw similar results in her own 2011 study, published in Clinical Infectious Disease. Her team studied college women who were given 16 ounces of 27 percent cranberry juice daily for six months and foundabsolutely no effect of cranberry juice at all, Foxman told the Daily Beast.

Their results are also backed by a 2012 meta-analysis conducted by the research organization Cochrane. The group reviewed 24 studies of more than 4,400 patients, and concluded that there was no significant benefit to cranberry juice, cranberry tablets, or cranberry capsules.

Foxman found that cranberry juice did work for a different population, however: women with a short-term urinary catheter implant. In that study, published in 2015 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Foxmans team observed a 50 percent reduction in UTI rates. And there are some studieslike this 2012 JAMA meta-analysisthat have linked the consumption of cranberry juice with the reduced incidence of UTIs in some populations.

Why the discrepancies? First, its hard to compare results from different subpopulationsUTIs in post-gynecological surgery catheter patients are a different beast than the garden-variety UTIs of your average college woman, Foxman explained. Juthani-Mehta added that each study tests different compoundslike juice, capsules, powders, and tabletsand different levels of proanthocyanidin, which will inevitably lead to variation in results.

And as Cosmopolitan first pointed out, there could be some conflicts of interest at playlike this study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition that found a link between cranberry juice and UTI preventionbut was funded by Ocean Spray.

So what can women count on to prevent UTIs? The most important thing women can do, Juthani-Mehta said, is simple: drink water.

The mainstay of UTI prevention should be hydration, she said. Women at risk for recurrent UTI should try to drink several glasses of water per day. For many women, this intervention alone prevents recurrent episodes.

While there may not be a definitive answer about the preventative powers of cranberry juice, Foxman said, one thing is clear: Its not going to treat a UTI on its own.

The evidence that cranberry juice [could be] an effective treatment for UTIs, Foxman said, is pretty strong that its not.

The correct treatment, Foxman explained, is a complicated question. Women who have recurring UTIs are probably fine drinking fluids and taking some Advil, and can always visit a doctor for antibiotics if the pain becomes unbearable. For these women, cranberry juices diuretic properties could be a plus.

But women experiencing the UTI symptoms for the first time, she said, should be more cautiousbecause STDs like chlamydia, which can cause infertility if left untreated, can present with similar symptoms.

And any woman experiencing fever, back pain, or flank pain should go to the emergency room immediately, she added, because those symptoms indicate a possibly life-threatening kidney infection.

All of the above treatments, Foxman said, take precedence over downing cranberry juice. But she took care to note that it wont cause any harmand theres no reason to toss it aside if it appears to be helping.

If it makes you feel better, Foxman said, its not going to hurt you."
2018-02-23,Daily Beast,Americas Love Affair With Madeira Wine,"Looking on a world map, Madeira doesnt look like more than a small smudge off the coast of Morocco. The eye tends to skip right over the archipelago and go immediately to the mainland. But its signature fortified wine played a major role in shaping American palates and fueled the democratic dreams of the countrys Founding Fathers.

Before you spit out your bourbon and rye in surprise, let me explain.

Sometime in the late 1600s Madeira began producing a low-alcohol white wine and by the 1750s its producers were fortifying it with some brandy. The islands were a frequent stop for ships sailing to the new world, since crews could buy barrels of wine before making the trans-Atlantic voyage. The islands were also exempt from Britains Navigation Act, which limited what wines and spirits could be sent to the colonies. It took on a life of its own, says Mannie Berk, founder of the Rare Wine Co., which stocks an impressive selection of vintage and modern Madeira. As a result, it became a real wine of luxury. Those who could afford it drank Madeira instead of the more common and less expensive beer, cider or rum.

For the Founding Fathers, it was the most important drink, says Berk. In fact, Thomas Jefferson gave the aging of Madeira considerable thought. According to the Thomas Jefferson Foundatione, he made a number of calculations for aging it in the winter of 1775. If a pipe of Madeira yields 30 doz. Bottles, we drink it at 7. Years old for 3/ a bottle, which includes the 7. Years interest. Such a bottle holds 15 common wine glasses...A pipe of new Madeira will yield 40. Dozen, which brings the price (there being no interest) to 20/ a doz. Or 20d the bottle when drank new. (Later in life, according to documents at his former home Monticello, he did switch to easier drinking wines from Italy and France, stating in 1817 [t]he taste of this country [was] artificially created by our long restraint under the English government to the strong wines of Portugal and Spain.)

Jefferson wasnt alone. George Washington was a big fan of Madeira and made sure his house was stocked with gallons and gallons of it. He was known to enjoy several glasses of it after his dinner, according to an article written by Mary V. Thompson, a research historian at Mount Vernon Estate and Garden.

During Americas Civil War, Madeira was massively popular in the coastal South, according to Berk, where alcohol was in great demand but the supply was, obviously, severely limited. However, soon after the war was over, winemakers across Europe were faced with a grape blight caused by the aphid-like phylloxera. Sales of Madeira were further hampered by the Russian Revolution, which caused havoc in one of its largest markets. The Madeira producers might have been able to survive except in their other large market, the U.S., the temperance movement was picking up steam and the sale of alcohol would, of course, be soon outlawed by Prohibition. The combination of these factors was just too much for the producers to handle.

Madeira virtually disappeared from liquor store shelves and bar menus for decades. It wasnt until the 1990s, according to Berk, that American drinkers became interested in it again.

Given that it is Presidents Week, I suggest you pick up a bottle of Madeira today and toast our Founding Fathers with their beverage of choice. Cheers!"
2018-08-03,Daily Beast,Cocote Is a Brutal Revenge Movie Teeming With Cults and Beheadings,"Cocote is as clear as day and as bewildering as a nightmare, as chaotic as a whirlwind and as calm as the Caribbean Sea. Its the last of these that intermittently serves as the backdrop for Nelson Carlo de los Santos Arias feature debut (in theaters today), which employs a dizzying array of formal techniques for a story that, at heart, is as streamlined and familiar as they comeand also as violent, with brutality lurking around every one of its twisty-turny corners.

The films title is the Spanish term for the nape of the necka vulnerable area of import for Alberto (Vincente Santos), a gardener for a wealthy family whose estate is introduced via a series of snapshots of their enormous pool, where children frolic and (later on) couples screw. Alberto is summoned to his Dominican Republic home to attend the funeral of his father Eusebio, who (prior to the start of the film) has been beheaded by a local cop named Martinez (Pepe Sierra) over an outstanding debt. Alberto learns of his dads decapitated fate as a woman carves up a chicken, and the meaning is clear: Eusebio was slaughtered like a lowly animal. Confronted with this disrespectful horror, Alberto is faced with a dilemma: avenge his paterfamilias assassination, or cling to his evangelical faith and turn the other cheek while mourning his loss with family members.

Dressed in white-collared shirts and neat slacks, Alberto is a man of few words, and his reticenceboth in manner and in deedis contrasted by those closest to him. Though his sister Karina (Judith Rodriguez Perez) believes shes not Eusebios biological daughter (she thinks he simply rescued her from the streets; Alberto has his doubts), she chides Alberto about his refusal to confront Martinez. Her vehemence is nothing compared to that of his other sister Patria (Yuberbi de la Rosa), who decries his inaction and the religious beliefs that begat it. Railing at him with rapid-fire fury, Patria slams him as a coward and his Christianity as a thing of the Devil, as well as something he only embraced out of guilt over his own (unspecified) wrongdoings. Father is condemned until we defend his honor, she screams at him, as de los Santos Arias camera moves from a position of intimate proximity to one of distant detachment.

That POV shift is part and parcel of a film that refuses to adhere to traditional structure and style. Cocote is a work of entrancing schizoid splendor, with de los Santos Arias and DP Roman Kasseroller using a variety of aesthetic modescolor and black-and-white; 1.85:1 widescreen and 1.37:1 aspect ratios; celluloid and digitalto create a crazed collage-like experience. The directors imagery changes radically on a dime, and often for no discernible reasontheres no apparent rhyme or reason for his flip-flopping between monochromatic and vibrant hues, or between expansive and boxy compositions. Consequently, its difficult, at least initially, to get ones bearings as his tale unfolds, a situation compounded by the fact that narrative information is sometimes parceled out by off-screen speakers during otherwise nondescript scenes.

This isnt to say that Cocote is difficult to comprehend. Albertos predicament is conveyed lucidly, if less than straightforwardly, and comes to the fore at regular intervals, such as during a startling confrontation between him, Karina and Martinez at a streetside bar. Astride a motorcycle in stopped traffic, Karina rails against Martinez (not for the first time, weve been told) for his crime, which he denies having committed, while telling Alberto to control his siblinga command that was previously passed along to him, in a threatening manner, by a nocturnal henchman. Their meeting is infused with explosive energy that feels all the more dangerous for arriving amidst so much tranquil action, which de los Santos Arias likes to shoot in deliberate 360-degree circular pans that capture figures moving in and out of the frame.

Bolstered by a cacophonous soundscape of natural, orchestral and electronic noises, Cocotes helter-skelter form creates an atmosphere of ever-present peril. Its a disorientating vision of a world fractured by bloodshed and religion, with Alberto attending Christian and pagan ceremonies that are held at unidentified locales (houses, cliff caves) and involve communal singing and writhing about in ecstasy and agony. During these funereal gatherings for Eusebio, relatives and acquaintances thrash and scream with exorcism-grade fervor.  Flailing prostration is also performed at the church Alberto attends, with a minister preaching against witchcraft with arm-waving intensity. Everywhere he goes, Alberto is greeted by passionate disorder.

The disconnect between the placid Alberto and his tumultuous surroundings is key to Cocotes distraught, dreamy dynamism. Even as it plunges into hallucinatory terrain, however, the film imparts a potent verite impression of its environment, be it through ambling jaunts along animal-populated beaches or glimpses at TV news broadcasts, such as one about a rooster that, locals believe, says, Christ is coming. The instability of Albertos Dominican environs are always palpable, even as he himself remains something of a mysterious protagonist, thanks in large part to de los Santos Arias foregrounding him in the proceedings one second, and consigning him to the background (behind playing children and wayward farm animals) the next.

Cocotes interplay of light and dark, serenity and turmoil, lends the drama a mythic weight, and speaks to its larger portrait of the countrys class schismshere most brilliantly addressed in a sequence (shot through a doorway that leads to a bright street and glistening ocean) in which a cop uses a heinous personal anecdote to inform Alberto about his working-class powerlessness. The materials opposing forces eventually seem like two halves of a circular whole, as if the inequalities, terrors, rituals and acts of retribution that comprise Albertos life are destined to repeat, ad infinitum. Definitive meaning remains, to the end, elusive. Still, de los Santos Arias film is an ethnographic revenge saga like few others, energized by a real feel for the Dominican Republics beauty and ugliness, and shrouded in disquieting moral and spiritual darkness."
2018-11-09,Daily Beast,Senate Dems Explore Suing Trump Over Matt Whitaker Appointment,"Senate Democrats are exploring the idea of suing the Trump administration over Matthew Whitakers appointment as acting attorney general, several Democratic lawmakers confirmed on Friday.

The suit would seek to invalidate Whitakers appointment, by arguing that it was an unconstitutional violation of the Senates advise and consent powers. If successful, it would force Trump to either formally nominate a replacement for former Attorney General Jeff Session or elevate, on an acting basis, someone from within the department who had already received Senate confirmation.

We have been doing a deep dive on potential causes of action concerning the constitutional issues raised by the Whitaker appointment and also obvious obstacles that could be raised to any court initiative, not the least of them standing,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told The Daily Beast. ""Weve been through a few of these issues in my emoluments lawsuit, principally the standing one. So were looking at the array of legal flaws in the appointment and considering which of them are challengeable in court.

A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment as no suit has yet been filed.

Talks of initiating a lawsuit have been limited as numerous lawmakers remain out of town. A separate lawmaker said he had not heard of discussions but would not be surprised if Senators did explore making a constitutional challenge to the Whitaker appointment.

Blumenthal, speaking for himself and not for others, said that its not entirely clear such a challenge could work. A plaintiff must have standing (i.e., prove that he or she has been harmed) in order to bring a suit in the first place.

Though a senator could argue that the harm of Whitakers appointment was that it deprived Congress of its constitutional duty, legal scholars are not convinced that this would pass judicial muster. A better foundation for standing would be for the plaintiff to have been directly affected by one of Whitakers first orders or memorandums, they say.

Stephen Gillers, a law professor at NYU, told The Daily Beast that such a suit could potentially succeed.

The Senate and each senator has obvious standing to challenge the Whitaker appointment, he said. Its not clear as of now who else will or can. The Senates standing is based on the fact that the appointment bypasses, for up to 210 days or longer, its advise and consent power. Of course, only the Democrats would be interested in the legal action but any senator has standing. It is the Senate that is most immediately harmed through the appointment.

Its a ridiculous lawsuit, Cleta Mitchell, a conservative lawyer with Foley & Lardner LLP, said of the idea. The president can appoint who he wants to. But you know that doesnt keep them from going to some crazy 9th circuit judge, an Obama-appointee in California, and getting somethingbut I dont think that theyll get anywhere with that.

The Senate Democrats are just trying to make themselves relevant after their shellacking on Tuesday, she added.

Whitaker was appointed the nations top law enforcement officer under the Vacancies Reform Act, which allows for the filling of vacant positions up to, in certain cases, 210 days. But because he was made a principal officerin that he reports directly to the presidenthis ascension has been legally dubious. On Thursday, two constitutional lawyers, Neal Katyal and George Conway, argued that the appointment was unconstitutional precisely because Whitaker had not been confirmed by the Senate for the AG job or the job had held prior, chief of staff to the AG. Whitaker had been confirmed by the Senate in 2004 as a U.S. Attorney in Iowa. But Katyal and Conway said that confirmation had effectively lapsed and was irrelevant to the current posting.

On Friday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) sent a letter to President Donald Trump questioning his authority to make the Whitaker appointment. I see no legitimate reason for you to have taken the unprecedented step of naming Mr. Whitaker, Schumer wrote. As an unconfirmed political appointee, Mr. Whitaker has not been subject to the scrutiny that the Constitution requires to ensure that he has the character, integrity and ability to fulfill the grave responsibilities of this job.

Schumers office declined to comment on the possibility of a lawsuit accompanying the letter.

David Rivkin, a constitutional attorney for Baker Hostetler who served in the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, said the Senate would have to vote as a body to have institutional standing to sue over Whitakers appointmentlike the House did when it sued over the Affordable Care Act.

The case law is absolutely clear: A rump group of senators can never have standing to vindicate institutional authority that they claim is being infringed because its not theirs to vindicate, any more than if a corporation or an association sues in federal court, it cannot be done by a janitor or a third assistant to a fifth deputy, he said.

Beyond the legality of his appointment, Whitaker has drawn criticism for comments he made on Justice Department officials as a Trump-boosting pundit. Whitaker made frequent cable news and radio appearances during Trump administration, lambasting Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into potential coordination between Trump associates and the Russian government. As The Daily Beast first reported, he said last summer that there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign. He also defended a conversation that Trump ally Gen. Michael Flynn had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the transition period. Flynn later lied about the conversation, and ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. He is awaiting sentencing. Whitaker has also accused Mueller of leaking to reporters."
2018-02-08,Daily Beast,How the Non-Binary Revolution Hit the West Coast,"If history is any lesson, the groundwork for a non-binary revolution is being laid now.

One of the most consequential moments in the transgender rights movement to date happened years before the so-called Transgender Tipping Point of 2014: In 2010, the U.S. State Department began allowing transgender people to change the gender markers on their passports from M to F or vice versa with a letter from a doctor rather than requiring sex reassignment surgery.

As The Daily Beast has previously reported, the Social Security Administration followed suit a few years later and state laws around drivers licenses began falling in line as well.

More and more transgender people were able to easily obtain appropriate government identificationa crucial component of a gender transition in a society where we are asked to show ID everywhere from airports to bars to job applications.

Now, M and F could soon be joined in more jurisdictions by a third gender marker, X, for those intersex, genderqueer, and non-binary people who identify as neither male nor female.

In fact, as of January 2018, the entire West Coast of the United States offers a non-binary gender marker option on some form of government identificationand advocates say more states will follow, piece by piece.

In some states we need the legislature to make it happen, but in some we dont, Toby Adams, executive director of the Intersex and Genderqueer Recognition Project (IGRP) told The Daily Beast. Its different from state to state.

Indeed, every state that has added a non-binary gender marker so far has used slightly different procedures to do so.

In June 2017the same month that Washington D.C. began allowing X on drivers licenses, Oregon became the first state in the U.S. to do so after state agencies, helped along by local advocates, fell in line with a court order issued on behalf of a non-binary person.

That administrative avenue, Oregon LGBT advocates say, should give some hope to people in less progressive parts of the country.

I think whats really exciting about the non-binary gender marker work is it didnt happen legislatively; it happened through partnerships with state agencies like the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Transportation, Amy Herzfeld-Copple, the co-executive director of Basic Rights Oregon told The Daily Beast, adding that Oregon has provided a blueprint and a toolkit for activists outside the West Coast to reach out to individual state agencies and gauge their receptiveness to change.

In October 2017, California offered a different road to X with SB 179, a piece of legislation co-authored by state Senator Toni Atkins and signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown that allowed for a non-binary gender markers on birth certificates and drivers licenses.

This law followed a February 2017 court order granting a legal non-binary gender to a client of the Oakland-based Transgender Law Center.

In a statement, Senator Atkins told The Daily Beast that LGBT rights have always been among [her] top priorities and that she is in regular contact with advocacy organizations that work on equality issues.

But the legislation, she adds, was also driven by personal experience with transgender and gender non-conforming people.

At the same time, I am friends with several families who have transgender children, Sen. Atkins said. Growing up transgender in this world is hard enough for a young person, and so I am always mindful of their struggle, and if I can help make life just a little bit easier and less stressful for these kids and their families, I will take that opportunity every time.

LGBT advocates like Transgender Law Center attorney Shawn Meerkamper, a non-binary person who uses they as a personal pronoun, predict that Californias leap toward non-binary inclusion will have a ripple effect throughout the country.

California being the most populous state and the sixth biggest economy in the worldthat certainly is going to have some amount of influence, they told The Daily Beast, adding that other places are going to have to catch up, even if only so that they can still be interacting and sharing information.

Most recently, the Washington State Department of Health in January opted to add X as a gender marker on birth certificates after a coalition of advocacy groups, including Gender Justice League, pushed for the change.

Given the fact that over 50 million people live on the West Coast and in Washington D.C., it is only a matter of time before the non-binary X begins appearing elsewhere.

Other states will have to grapple with the fact that there is an increasing number of people from the West Coast and D.C. who have X as a gender marker on their identity documents, Danni Askini, executive director of Gender Justice League, told The Daily Beast.

The emerging stories of intersex non-binary people who have changed their gender markers prove that the addition of an X is not just a minor administrative footnote; it tangibly benefits those people whose genders are not best described by an M or an F.

Adrian A. Roberts, a non-binary DJ who by the IGRPs count became the 11th Californian to become legally non-binary last spring, told the advocacy group that they travel frequently and often get a double take from TSA agents after displaying ID.

A simple non-binary X as my gender marker would immediately explain everything they need to know, Roberts told IGRP, in press materials provided to The Daily Beast. Besides making my life easier, it would also legitimize my transgender identity in the eyes of the government, as well as society in general.

Indeed, for many intersex, genderqueer, and non-binary people, a small smattering of states allowing  an X on a handful of documents is nowhere near enough to reduce instances of discrimination and misgendering.

Jonny Violette Skye, an intersex person who also identifies as non-binary obtained a matching Oregon drivers license but still faces widespread problems.

Every day, I am incorrectly labeled not only on legal documents at the local, state, and federal level but by businesses who have not yet been pressured by enough of their customers to change, including banking institutions, the medical industry, the utility companies, airlines, cell phone carriers, the list goes on, Skye told IGRP.

For many transgender people, including those whose lives fall outside the binary, the United States remains a patchwork of policies around identity documentseven as more sweeping progress around non-binary inclusion gets made on the international stage, in Canada and the United Kingdom.

Thats why IGRP and other advocacy groups remain focused ons spreading the X to as many states as possible.

Toby Adams told The Daily Beast that Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland all have pending legislation around non-binary options on government identificationand that advocacy in Rhode Island and New Hampshire will probably move forward within the next year.

Every DMV and Vital Records agency weve talked to has said, Yes, we want to do this, we know we need to do this, Adams said.

If a pending Lambda Legal lawsuit against the U.S. State Department gets resolved in favor of an intersex person named Dana Zzym, then we could start seeing non-binary gender markers on U.S. passports in the future as well.

For transgender people who do identify as male or female, passport gender marker changes have been a gateway to widespread policy reform, as the last eight years have proved; for those outside the binary, such a change would be like rocket fuel for a movement that is just getting started."
2018-11-01,Daily Beast,Illinois Police Chief Shared Photos From Secret Recordings of Sexual Encounters Prosecutors,"An Illinois police chief secretly recorded his sexual encounters with at least two women, then shared explicit images of them without their consent, prosecutors alleged this week.

Christian Daigre, the Chicago Heights Park District police chief, has been charged with two felony counts of non-consensual dissemination of sexual images, two counts of intimidation, and one count of drug possession after an investigation, the Cook County States Attorneys Office confirmed to The Daily Beast.

Allegations are egregious & if proven, [it is] a disgraceful abuse of power & trust from police & community, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Wednesday, announcing the arrest.

Daigre was placed on administrative earlier this month, Guglielmi confirmed to The Daily Beast, and appeared for a bail hearing Wednesday, where a Cook County judge set his bail bond at $25,000.

Two women, a 24-year-old and a 43-year-old, allegedly met Daigre through an online-dating site and each had several consensual sexual encounters with him in early 2016. Unbeknownst to them, Daigre filmed those encounters with a camera placed on the ceiling of his studio apartment, prosecutors allege.

Daigre, who is married with four children, then sent still images from the recordings via text message to another person without the womens consent, prosecutors said on Wednesday.

Neither victim gave defendant permission to record the sexual acts nor disseminate the images, Assistant States Attorney Rachel Mabbott said.

In some of the blurry photos, Daigre appears to be giving the camera a thumbs-up, police said.

Theres more than two women, and Im hoping through the media and through the exposure on this case, more women come forward, said Frank Avila, an attorney for one of the victims.

When police searched the apartment Tuesday, they also found a small envelope and bag containing what they believe to be cocaine, prosecutors said.

Earlier this month, the two women contacted the authorities after learning of the existence of the videos and explicit text messages, according to police. The phone number that sent the messages is registered to Daigre, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors allege the police chief sent the images to a fellow cop in the departmentthen later sent threatening text messages to the colleague and his victims after they went to the police.

In the threatening texts, which were linked to Diagre through phone records, the police chief said he would hurt the cooperating colleague and his family, and claimed that if his female victims didnt drop their charges, they would be sued, or worse, prosecutors said.

The number the texts were sent from was allegedly registered to Christian Smith, a pseudonym Daigre has used in the past on Facebook and various dating websites, authorities said.

Daigres attorney, Todd Pugh, told The Daily Beast on Thursday that his client denies all of the allegations and is being unfairly framed.

The allegations alone and these charges have absolutely destroyed his life, Pugh said.

In court Wednesday, the defense attorney described Daigre as a married family man, an organizer for his local parent-teacher association, and a member of the Chicago Police Department football team. He claimed Daigre has been set up by the cooperating witness, identifying him as former Chicago Heights Park District Police Chief Jose Maldonado.

Maldonado did not immediately respond to The Daily Beasts request for comment.

Pugh told the judge that Maldonado, who was suspended in 2016 after a DUI arrest, was out to get Daigre because he served as a key witness in a recent criminal case in which Maldonado was accused of falsely claiming to be the Chicago Heights Park District police chief.

[Daigre] didnt have any bad blood with him, but he didnt think that he supported him, maybe, to the level that he should have, Pugh said of Maldonado.

Court records confirm that Maldonado was indicted earlier this month for false personation of a police officer and knowingly and falsely representing himself as the Chicago Heights Park District police chief in August, when Daigre was the departments acting chief.

This has been a vendetta case against my client for being a states witness against the alleged victim in this case, Pugh insisted in court.

Frank Avila, who is also Maldonados attorney, shot back in court, calling the claims utterly ridiculous, noting his client had told police of Daigres alleged crimes before he was indicted for the false personation charge.

Its an illogical argument and the truth will come out. My clients allegations are just the tip of the iceberg, Avila said.

As for the video camera, Pugh concluded in court, the apartment had a large sign telling people they were on camera.

Anybody who was in that apartment was on notice that they were being recorded, he said."
2018-07-14,Daily Beast,When the Zombie Apocalypses Biggest Threat Isnt PeopleIts Boredom,"Should the zombie apocalypse ever arrive, a series of short- and long-term measures would be required in order to survive. Locating and acquiring a fortified shelter. Procuring a considerable amount of food. Devising a means of collecting water and staying warm, in light of the fact that plumbing and power systems would invariably shut down. Gaining access to tools, clothing and medical supplies, as well as space to move, so exercise was an available option. Obtaining a weapon or two  preferably a firearm  that could be used in the event of a run-in with the walking dead or other hostiles. And avoiding as many companions as possible, both to prolong ones provisions and to limit the chances of confrontations and mistakes that could lead to doom.

Yet even if one achieved that ideal scenario, the question remains  would it be enough? According to The Night Eats the World (in theaters and on VOD July 13), the answer is no. Because regardless of how safe and well-stocked one might be, thered still be no defense against a threat even more insidious than flesh-eaters: boredom.

The gnawing insanity that comes from being alone is the primary focus of French director Dominique Rochers adaptation of Pit Agarmens novel, about a man named Sam (Oslo, August 31sts Anders Danielsen Lie) forced to deal with a pandemic on his own. That cataclysm occurs after Sam attends a party at the Parisian apartment of ex-girlfriend Fanny (Sigrid Bouaziz), whom he visits in order to retrieve some old cassette tapes he left with her. In trying to complete that task, hes forced to watch her canoodle with her new beau Mathieu (David Kammenos) and, in the process, face the reality that his old world is gone, supplanted by a new, less pleasant one. That paradigm becomes true again, on a grander scale, the following day, when he awakens in her bedroom  having fallen asleep while tending to a bloody nose  to discover that the place is in bloody shambles, and that Fanny is missing half her face and eager to eat him with her soundlessly chomping mouth.

Barricading himself inside the flat, Sam realizes hes by himself  and thus protected from the zombie menace that, as he can see from outside a window, has consumed the entire city (and, likely, the world). After listening to horrified voicemails left on the cell phones of now-missing partygoers, and viewing Paris from the roof to which he has access, he begins establishing a course of action. That becomes far easier when an unexpected shotgun blast blows a hole through his new homes floors. The shot comes from the resident below, whos taken his own life, and Sam rightfully identifies this sad turn of events as an opportunity to scavenge. Climbing through the enlarged hole, he raids the guys domicile for additional goods, and afterwards ventures into other parts of the building  where he has a dangerous encounter with an undead couple and their child, and then manages to lock the front door. Sanctuary is his.

Director Rocher drenches most of this earlygoing in creepy silence, the better to augment his simmering suspense. Once Sam has set himself up in this largely abandoned abode, The Night Eats the World truly kicks into gear  by which I mean, gets totally comfortable idling alongside its protagonist, who finds solace, and then unhappiness, in his tranquil day-to-day routine. Buckets and containers placed on the roof catch rain water. A fireplace provides warmth. A doctor named Alfred (Holy Motors Denis Lavant, in a strangely soulful lifeless-monster turn) serves as companionship of a sort, given that as a zombie locked in an elevator car, hes someone with whom Sam can have a (one-way) conversation. And a drum kit in a young boys bedroom offers him the ability to blow off some steam, even as the furious cacophony he creates compels outdoor zombies to race to the building looking for a next meal.

Sam also preoccupies himself with the aforementioned cassettes, which contain voices (his own, and his fathers) from a childhood past thats forever gone. The problem for Lies character is that theres no real present or future either; instead, everything has been replaced by a terrible stasis that he both wants to maintain (out of self-preservation necessity) and increasingly despises. The Night Eats the World occasionally concocts moments of peril to keep the material from devolving into torpor. But by and large, torpor is its main subject  as is the discontent it breeds. A foreigner in a foreign land speaking a foreign language (English), stuck in the apartment of a former girlfriend whos now as dead as the rest of mankind, Sam is a lonely soul displaced in every possible way.

Entombed in his own solitude, Sam is rejected by a stray cat that opts to stay beside its new zombie master, and denied death by a hand of fate that seems to enjoy toying with him. Working from Jeremie Guezs script, Rocher shows empathy for Sams plight but pulls no punches in detailing its bleakness, replete with a late meeting with a surprise visitor (Golshifteh Farahani) that only leads to further suffering. To that end, the director is blessed by an arresting performance from Lie, who, whether bearded or clean-shaven, has a long, pallid countenance and sorrowful eyes that convey the inner despair slowly consuming his loner. Lie does a lot with little, imbuing  with his heavy body language and searching, pitiable gazes  mundane chores with a measure of small, quiet tragedy. He makes Sam a relatable everyman, cracking under the pressure of an unthinkable dilemma for which theres no apparent solution.

As befitting a tale rooted in gloomy seclusion, The Night Eats the World doesnt culminate with a bang so much as continue to play like a drawn-out whimper over the (logistical, emotional, psychological) futility of isolation. Sams realization that desperate times eventually call for desperate measures is long in coming, and provides a final jolt of tension to the oft-placid proceedings. Moreover, it illustrates that the only thing that truly keeps people alive is hope  for another tomorrow, to be sure, but also for the human contact and connection thats ultimately so vital to our survival."
2018-09-25,Daily Beast,Stormy Daniels Suit Against Trump Could Be Tossed Over Chilling Effect,"A federal judge in Los Angeles could soon toss the defamation lawsuit Stormy Daniels filed against President Trump earlier this year.

On Monday afternoon, U.S. District Judge S. James Otero said Trumps tweet in response to Daniels claim that a mystery goon intimidated her in Las Vegas appeared to be rhetorical hyperbole and protected speech.

In April, Daniels and her attorney presented a forensic sketch of a man who allegedly warned her to leave Trump alone in 2011, soon after she spilled the story of her alleged romp with Trump to InTouch magazine.

Daniels sued Trump for defamation, claiming he was pegging her as a liar on Twitter.

A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)! Trump wrote.

Judge Otero, who could issue a ruling in the coming days or weeks, said allowing Daniels defamation claim to continue would bring a chilling effect for candidates running for office and hamper political discourse, the New York Daily News reported.

After the hearing, Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti told reporters Trumps First Amendment argument reeked of hypocrisy.

This is the same Donald Trump that has crapped all over the First Amendment and the news media for years (and) wants to jail journalists, Avenatti said. The irony associated with that is absolutely palpable.

Meanwhile, a hearing for Daniels lawsuit against Trump and his ex-attorney, Michael Cohen, over the infamous hush agreement is scheduled for December."
2018-03-04,Daily Beast,Alec Baldwins Trump Sends Off Hope Hicks on SNL So Smart So Hot,"At times like this, we look to our leaders for guidance, Saturday Night Lives Anderson Cooper said on the first episode since the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Instead, we'll hear from Donald Trump.

After taking three straight weeks off for the Winter Olympics, SNL roared back onto the air this week with a cold open that found Alec Baldwins Trump addressing Americas gun violence epidemic in yet another meeting with lawmakers. And it came just one day after the real Donald Trump railed against Baldwins dying mediocre career yet again on Twitter.

Believe me, no one loves the Second Amendment and due process more than me, Baldwins president said. But maybe we just take everyones guns away. OK? Nobody is allowed to have a gun. Not even whites.

The youth of America deserve to feel safe and secure in their schools, because folks, I can only run into so many schools and save everybody, Trump said later, echoing yet another real thing he actually said this week. If I could, Id run into all of them, even without a weapon. Id burst through the doors and Id be running so fast, the guy with the gun wouldnt even know what hit him.

That line of thinking led Baldwins Trump to remark that he is practically running the White House all by himself these days, especially after the sudden departure of Hope Hicks. Shes like a daughter to me, so smart, so hot, he said. She resigned. You know, I hate seeing her go, but I love watching her walk away.

I mean, Jared Kushners basically the hottest chick left in the place, he added. And hes probably going to jail soon, so hes out.

The one member of his cabinet he does think needs to go is his Attorney General Jeff Sessions. I call him Mr. Magoo, everyone loves it. People around here in the White House say stop, Im laughing so hard, I cant take it anymore, I resign.

With that, Kate McKinnons Sessions appeared to ensure the president hes not going anywhere. Im like skunk stink on a bird dog, sir, I linger, Sessions said. And I just had dinner with all your friends at the Department of Justice and wowyour name popped up more than a weasel in a pumpkin patch."
2018-04-26,Daily Beast,Patton Oswalt Opens Up About Late Wife Michelle McNamaras Role in the Golden State Killer Case Arre,"Comedian Patton Oswalt spent much of his day on Wednesday celebrating the news that authorities have apparently arrested the Golden State Killer. He ended it with an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers that could not have been timed better.

Before she passed away in early 2016, Oswalts wife Michelle McNamara had been working on a book about the notorious rapist and murdererwhom she dubbed the Golden State Killerwith the aim of discovering his true identity and helping the police track him down. Earlier this year, Ill Be Gone in the Dark was finally published and has already shot back to the top of Amazons best-seller list.

I have been awake since 3 a.m., Oswalt confessed at the top of the segment. So I dont know how this segments going to go. He explained that he started receiving texts and alerts early Wednesday morning with the big news. They arrested him today, he said. He is in jail.

Oswalt told Meyers that McNamaras book really amped up all of the interest in the case and really put a lot of focus on this. He added, It was her dream. She always said, I dont care about credit, I want to know that hes in jail. And now hes caught, the bracelets are on, and it feels like this thing that she wanted so badly is now done. Its just amazing.

Later, Oswalt read aloud from the end of McNamaras book, which she called Letter to an Old Man. In it, she imagines the moment the object of her obsession will finally be caught. This is how it ends for you, she wrote. Youll be silent forever and Ill be gone in the dark, you threatened a victim once. Open the door. Show us your face. Walk into the light. Oswalt added, And thats what he did today.

Even though he was still neck-deep in grief, Oswalt said that he wanted to help finish the book because, I knew that I wouldnt be able to live and go on with life if this was left undone.

And now, you know, because hes been caught, now they can start linking him to all these other cases. Theres all of this new evidence. I mean, its amazing, he continued. This is the beginning of the whole other chapter of this, of this sagathis insane crime saga."
2018-11-24,Daily Beast,Hollywood Producer Terry Rossio Under Fire for Comparing Anti-Vaxxer Label to N-Word,"The Hollywood screenwriter behind Pirates of the Caribbean and Shrek is at the center of a social media firestorm after using a racial slur to defend parents who choose not to vaccinate their children.

In response to a fellow screenwriter who called for an increase in vaccination participation, producer and screenwriter Terry Rossio wrote, My heart goes out to all the parents of vaccine damaged children, who have to not only endure the sadness of their loss, but also the vitriol of ill-informed and insensitive people (such as those here). Anti-Vax is equivalent to calling someone a n***** and makes as little sense.

When the writer who started the conversation asked Rossio to please never come on my feed with the n word again, Rossio doubled down, arguing in a thread that the stigma faced by African-Americans is similar to that faced by those who refuse to vaccinate their children out of scientifically discredited fears of autism.

Rossios many criticsthe tweet had more than a thousand repliesincluded fellow screenwriter Jeffrey Grubb, who responded acidly: God, this is such a good point. I remember how American founders and citizens enslaved vaccine skeptics for decades. And then, even after freeing them, the government enshrined laws to marginalize vaccine deniers and to deny them wealth and opportunity. Thats just history.

Another Twitter user replied to Rossio with the announcement that his comment inspired him to donate $25 to a nonprofit that vaccinates children around the world.

Rossio, whose credits include Aladdin and The Lone Ranger, as well as the upcoming feature adaptation of Johnny Quest, did not respond to a request for comment. Two years ago, he reportedly acquired the rights to a book by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, whose work linking vaccines to autism has been repudiated in the scientific community.

Dr. Wakefield is clearly a polarizing figure, reviled by the general public yet also revered by many. The details and drama surrounding his life are even more remarkable than generally known, Rossio said at the time."
2018-05-04,Daily Beast,Trump to Appoint Dr Oz Bill Belichick to Health Council,"Some famous facesand questionable reputationsare joining President Donald Trumps Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.

On Friday afternoon, Trump announced that he plans to appoint New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick and Dr. Mehmet Oz to his council. Belichick is a known Trump supporter, and Dr. Oz is most famous for his daytime talk show, The Dr. Oz Show.

Belichick, Oz, and 18 othersincluding an NBC executive, the chief executive officer of SlimFast, and a Boys & Girls Clubs of America executivewill be appointed to the presidents council for a term of two years, according to a White House release.

Oz, an Ivy League-educated cardiac surgeon, rose to fame after being a frequent guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show, for whom he dispensed medical advice. He also penned the book You: The Owners Manual, along with various other spin-off books.

But the content of his Emmy-winning talk show has been questioned by medical professionals. Researchers found that nearly 4 in 10 of the assertions made on the hit show appear to be made on the basis of no evidence at all, according to The Los Angeles Times. Of the evidence that was based on medical fact, 32 percent was deemed to be general medical advice, while 25 percent focused on diet, and 18 percent focused on weight loss.

In 2015, 10 physicians called for Columbia University to boot Oz from his role as a senior administrative position in the Department of Surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, according to NBC News.

Dr. Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgements about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both, the group of doctors wrote in their letter to the university. Whatever the nature of his pathology, members of the public are being misled and endangered, which makes Dr. Ozs presence on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution unacceptable.

Dr. Oz responded to his critics, insisting that The Dr. Oz Show was not a medical show in a 2015 interview with NBC News. He stated that the purpose of his show is not to talk about medicine, while admitting there are segments that I made that I wish I could take back. Despite the letter, Dr. Oz remains employed at Columbia.

Congress has also taken aim at the miraculous weight-loss solutions Dr. Oz has prominently featured on his show. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee invited Oz to testify on the danger of over-the-counter diet pills, but grilled him on the miracle methods and products hes hawked, The Washington Post reported.

People want to believe you can take an itty-bitty pill to push fat out of your body, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) said to Oz during the hearing. The scientific community is almost monolithically against you.

Green coffee bean extract was also touted by Oz as the next big breakthrough in weight loss. Oz went on television to laud the treatment, claiming the pill would make people lose up to a pound a week.

Too good to be true? Yes. The Federal Trade Commission won a $3.5 million settlement against the extract manufacturer in 2014, and a 2012 Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy journal study promoting its health benefits was retracted. The FTC called the study so hopelessly flawed that no reliable conclusions could be drawn from it.

In response to his planned appointment to the presidents council, Dr. Oz wrote on Twitter Friday that, serving on @FitnessGov offers a platform to amplify the best practices shown to work across our school systems.

Ive been supporting childrens health programs with @HealthCorps and appreciate the need to improve lifestyle opportunities for our youth, he said."
2018-05-20,Daily Beast,Mnuchin Trade War With China Is On Hold,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced on Sunday that the United States was temporarily halting its planned tariffs on Chinese imports while the two nations continue to negotiate.

Were putting the trade war on hold, Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday, adding that the U.S. and China agreed to a framework whereby China would buy more goods from the U.S. in order to make up for the trade deficit between the two countries.

The announcement came after top Chinese officials visited Washington last week for negotiations on the Trump administrations trade policies. The president had previously revealed plans to impose tariffs on $150 billion on Chinese imports, a move that angered conservatives economists and members of his own party on Capitol Hill. China responded at the time by threatening tariffs on American goods, which could have sparked an all-out trade war.

Mnuchin declined to discuss the details of the framework, which the White House and Beijing said included meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a statement on Sunday commending President Donald Trump but warned that the negotiators shouldnt blow it by allowing intellectual-property concerns and Chinese telecommunications firm ZTEwhich has been the target of and has violated U.S. sanctionsto go unaddressed.

[Trump] could always decide to put the tariffs back on if China doesnt go through with their commitment, said Mnuchin, addressing concerns that a simple promise from China to buy more U.S. products wouldnt be sufficient.

Larry Kudlow, Trumps top economic adviser, said on ABCs This Week that ZTE would not get off scot-free, but added that the U.S. was willing to work with China on some small changes around the edges to the company.

The U.S. trade deficit with China topped $375 billion last year. Kudlow said China would increase its purchases of American goods by a rough ballpark estimate of $200 billion."
2018-05-15,Daily Beast,Justices Thomas and Gorsuch Just Hinted They Would End Privacy as We Know It,"This week, in the case of Byrd v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a person driving a rental car has the right to privacythat is, not to have the car searched without probable causeeven if hes not listed on the rental contract. Its an interesting case, especially for law students, but not earth-shattering.

But the short concurring opinion by Justice Thomas, which Justice Gorsuch joined, is a terrifying warning to anyone who cares about privacy in the age of digital surveillance.

I have serious doubts about the reasonable expectation of privacy test, Justice Thomas began. At which point my eyes popped out of my head.

For more than half a century, the reasonable expectation of privacy has been a bedrock of Fourth Amendment law in the United States. It is what keeps us safe from arbitrary government searches in our cars, in schools, and everywhere else outside the home. It is the doctrine whose boundaries are continually tested in the world of Big Data. And it is apparently a principle doubted by two justices of the Supreme Court.

To be sure, the words reasonable expectation of privacy do not appear in the Constitution, which is what irks originalists like Gorsuch and Thomas. Rather, the Fourth Amendment states that The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.

That phrase covered the field in 1791. At the time, there were far fewer ways in which governmental searches might otherwise take place, particularly if you were the kind of propertied white male the text had in mind. And the Framers were clearly reacting against British armys use of the general warrant to search peoples homes without any specific cause.

Well, times have changed. A crucial case this term, for example, is Carpenter v. United States. There, the question is whether the government needs a warrant to obtain a persons location data from cellphone-tower records. Its a close case, and it could go either way. But however it turns out, the reasonable expectation of privacy will be the standard the court usesnot some imaginary world in which the Founders knew about cellphones.

And so it has been for 50 years, since Katz v. United States, in 1957. Courts have determined that people have a reasonable (i.e. objective, rather than subjective) expectation of privacy exists not just in ones person and property, but also in cars (to a more limited extent), hotel rooms, phone booths (that was the question in Katz), and phone records, but not garbage left out for collection, public documents one has signed (for obtaining a handwriting sample), or prison cells.

And, this week, to rental cars a person is driving even if theyre not listed on the rental agreement.

The Katz standard is not perfect. It requires the court to decide what society deems to be reasonableunderstandings that are recognized and permitted by society, in the words of one case. Thats a moving target and a better subject for sociologists than jurists. Katz also rejects, but still mostly maintains, the general understanding that a search is about a physical intrusion into a private space. Its a messy test.

But Justice Thomas alternative is far more problematic. Returning to the text of the Fourth Amendment, he writes, The issue, then, is whether Byrd can prove that the rental car was his effect. That issue seems to turn on at least three threshold questions. First, what kind of property interest do individuals need before something can be considered their... effec[t] under the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment? Second, what body of law determines whether that property interest is presentmodern state law, the common law of 1791, or something else? Third, is the unauthorized use of a rental car illegal or otherwise wrongful under the relevant law [and does it] affect the Fourth Amendment analysis?

This half century of judicial time travel would erase privacy rights as we know them today. Its hard to see how ones cellphone records, for example, count as a personal effect (i.e. personal property). Or ones web browser history, as tracked by an internet service provider. Or digital records of any kind, for that matter, unless they include a specific property interest.

Originalism is one thing, but limiting the Constitution to property rights cognizable in the days of the horse and carriage is another. As in many other areas of Justice Thomas jurisprudencecivil rights chief among themhis principles would create a majoritarian republic that looks nothing like American democracy today.

Nor is Justice Thomas originalism at all consistent. The same day he railed against the reasonable expectation of privacy, he joined the court in expanding the doctrine of anti-commandeering, which is also not found in the Constitution.

Now, Justice Thomas has been writing crazy things for a long time. In the abortion case of Whole Womens Health, he said that since the time of FDR, the Supreme Courts constitutional jurisprudence is an unworkable morass of special exceptions and arbitrary applications.

And dissenting from the landmark same-sex marriage case, Obergefell v. Hodges, he wrote that state benefits like marriage have nothing to do with dignity, stating that slaves did not lose their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them to be enslaved. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government denies them those benefits.

That is, to put it mildly, an idiosyncratic view.

Whats different is that now, there are, in effect, two Justice Thomases, due to the addition of Justice Gorsuch to the court, which, of course, was the result of unprecedented and democracy-shattering malfeasance on the part of Senate Republicans who refused to even consider the nomination of Merrick Garland.

One weird, quirky justice is an outlier. Two begins to look like a constituency.

Nor is this the first time that Justices Gorsuch and Thomas have together tacked to the right of the courts conservative members. In a case about providing government funding to a church playground, the conservative majority held that such funding was not an unconstitutional support of a church, since it was offered to all playgrounds. Gorsuch wrote (and Thomas joined) that it was support of a church, and that was just fine.

In another case last year, the court struck down Arkansas policy of listing straight couples who use artificial insemination on a childs birth certificate, but not listing gay couples who do similarly. Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justices Thomas and Alito) wrote that marriage under Obergefell doesnt mean equal marriage.

It used to be that Republicans wanted another Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court: Someone with intellectual heft who moved the mainstream to the right while respecting the basic contours of Supreme Court jurisprudence.

Increasingly, though, they now say they want another Justice Thomas: Someone wholl throw out the baby with the bathwater, junk decades of precedent because he doesnt like them, and radically remake the American state.

In Justice Gorsuch, it seems like theyve got one."
2018-10-15,Daily Beast,Kurt Eichenwald I Was Almost Kicked Out of School for Having Epilepsy,"Convulsions dominated my first two years at Swarthmore College. My first neurologist, Dr. Charles Nicholson, instructed me to tell no one about my epilepsy because otherwise I would be subjected to severe discrimination. I hid out in my dorm room, and begged my roommates to keep my secret. My second neurologist almost killed me with toxic levels of medication. Broken bones, burns, nightmares, and hopelessness led me to plan suicide.

Then, in the summer after my sophomore year, I met Dr. Alan Naarden, a top neurologist. His treatment decreased my number of convulsions dramatically. He instructed me to stop hiding and to seek emotional support from a school psychologist.

For the first time, I began walking the campus alone. Over eight weeks, I experienced two convulsions outside; just a month earlier, before my medication change, that number would have been in the dozens. For the first time since my diagnosis, the school was being exposed to my seizures.

Rapidly, officials began planning to throw me out. The psychologist, Leighton Whitaker, declared that I had an undetected brain tumor, claiming he could diagnose it based on my speech patterns. No one told me he had said this. When the experts shot him down, school officials took a new approach.

In a surprise, my mother arrived and let me know the school wanted to remove methis time claiming I was failing my classes and had no social life, both of which were false. Given how much my health had improved, I went to the meeting with Swarthmore officials confident I had nothing to fear, and that once they understood the dramatic decline in my number of seizures, the issue would blow over.

This recounting is based on contemporaneous diaries, both audiotaped and written, as well as interviews and other records.

As I crossed campus that evening, lamps flicked on under a darkening sky. My right hand was thrust inside my sweat shirt pocket, holding the tape of the performance by my a cappella group from ten days before. I hadnt brought my cassette recorder. I assumed that showing the tape of the Sixteen Feet concert would be sufficient proof that I hadnt been wandering in a daze, waiting passively for my next convulsion.

I met my mother behind the health center, and we headed inside. In a dimly lit room waited several school officials, including the psychologist, the internist, the health center director, and a member of the security staff. We took our chairs.

Now, am I wasting my time? I asked. Has a decision already been made, or is this really a discussion?

I noticed Whitaker and the center director stiffen in their seats. I reasoned that those two had been more directly involved in planning with the dean than the others.

This is a discussion, said Jeffrey Millington, a Swarthmore internist. Staying at school may not be the best thing for you right now. Why not just go home and get better? Why make it hard on yourself?

Primarily because thats my choice, I replied. Listen, Im sure everyone here thinks they have my best interest at heart. The reality is, most of you know very little about my treatment and whats going on.

I explained that I had been very sick for two years and spent a lot of that time hiding. But a new specialist had prescribed medications that were better controlling my seizures. I was much better physically and psychologically.

You werent well when you came here on Monday, the health center director said. You were very badly off.

Im sure I was, I replied. It was a fluke. I had a seizure sometime Saturday night. I messed up my medication afterwards and forgot to eat. By the time I got here, my levels were terrible. I looked at Millington, who had checked my blood. Right?

He nodded to the group. Thats true.

But all of you are missing the most important question. Why should I go home? The pace of adjusting medications wont change. My neurologist isnt deciding my dosage based on whether Im at school. If I go home, every adjustment and every test will be on the same schedule as it would be if I was here.

Whitaker interrupted. Well, Kurt, you havent had a complete diagnosis. You havent had the scan we discussed, and you havent had the Halstead-Reitan Test Battery.

My mothers face went stony. We do have a complete diagnosis, she snapped. They dont have any need for those other tests. Theres nothing to find.

Well, you dont have everything, Whitaker said.

We have everything that needs to be done, my mother responded. And you know that.

I watched this soft-spoken but grim tete-a-tete with puzzlement. You know that. How would he know? He was a psychologisthe probably understood less about epilepsy than I did. In fact, neither Whitaker nor my mother was qualified to debate diagnostic tests. I assumed she was simply relaying her confidence in Naarden. I had no idea Whitaker had just revived his nonsensical argument about a brain tumor that experts shot down two weeks earlier.

My mother and Whitaker glared at each other. Then, without a word, Whitaker stood and left the room. I glanced around at the remaining group.

What the hell is going on?

I wasnt sure what to say. Um . . .

No, Millington replied. We need to keep discussing this.

I thought about asking if we should wait until Whitaker returned. Then I realized he was gone. This was the guy who had spun fantastical tales about developing the high-tech electrodes that allowed doctors to diagnose me, and now he was pretending to know neurology better than a neurologist. I figured his ego couldnt handle being contradicted by my mother.

Okay, I said. Well, anyway, contrary to what Dr. Whitaker just said, theres nothing to be done. Ill go home, and Ill sit around. My neurologist is going to run some more tests, but not until Ive been on the medications a little longer. Theyre scheduled for Thanksgiving vacation.

No secrets. Theres also something that might be hard for you all to understand, I explained. From almost the beginning of my seizures, Ive had this psychological commitment to graduating with my class. Its the thing I hold on to. Its my proof I can survive this, that I can live my life even if the seizures never improve. If you send me home, youre taking that from me. Ill lose a semester. I wont graduate with my class. I know it might not make sense to you, but that would devastate me. Youd rob me of what I hold on to, for no reason.

As Millington started to reply, Janet Dickerson, the dean, walked quietly into the room. Whitaker left; Dickerson came in. I wondered if they were tag-teaming this meeting.

Ambush, I thought. She had agreed to my demand that she not attend this meeting so the school couldnt railroad a dismissal.

Dickerson took a seat near me. I think its important that Im part of this conversation, she said.

Okay, I said. Well, youve missed my explanation why going home wont result in getting faster medical care. You want me to start again?

What? Im confused, I said. Then what is this about?

Kurt, she said softly, youre not well. Youre not functioning academically, and youre not functioning socially.

Back to this. My mother had warned me. Okay, thats a different topic than what we were discussing.

But thats the issue. You need to go home and get care so you can handle college.

I rubbed my forehead, trying to keep from raising my voice.

All right, academics, I said. I want to know how you concluded Im not functioning academically when I havent had a test, a graded assignment, a quiz, a paper, or anything.

I smiled. No, I havent. My first midterm is Monday.

The room fell still. So how is it you think Im not functioning academically? I asked.

Im fighting gossip. Have you bothered to ask the professors? I asked in an angry, sarcastic voice.

Would you like me to? she said, mimicking my tone.

I picked up the phone on the desk where we were sitting and placed it in front of her.

She reached for a phone book, and I told her the names of my professors. She first called Professor Richard Rubin and asked for my grade in his public policy class. I smiled inwardly because I knew what he was sayinghe had no idea.

Well, can you estimate what you think his grade will be? she asked.

She looked at me as she listened. I tried hard not to look smug. Then she thanked Rubin and hung up.

He said you were doing well.

She again flipped through the phone book, searching for the home number of my statistics professor, Rob Hollister.

Millington broke the silence. Kurt, we need to check your blood today. Lets do it now.

I followed him to one of the exam rooms, where he closed the door and brought out the usual equipment. As he slid the needle into my vein, he seemed tense.

Im really sorry about the way theyre doing this.

That was a surprise. I thought you wanted me to leave.

I do, but not this way, Millington said.

When I walked back to the main room, I saw that the security officer and health center director had left. I headed to the mens room and noticed Whitaker standing in a hallway, leaning against the wall.

Is he feeding Dickerson this nonsense? I glanced at him with scorn. What a coward, I thought. The contempt I had for him at that moment was immeasurable.

I returned to the interrogation room, as I now thought of it. Dickerson was off the phone. So, I said, what did Hollister guess my grade might be when I take a test?

Jesus Christ! First of all, thats not true. Second, if you dismiss Swarthmore students for not functioning socially, youre not going to have much of a college left.

No, its ridiculous. Im doing lots of things. I founded an a cappella group with my roommate, and weve already had a performance. Im working with the Swarthmore Players Club. Im already working on the spring musical Im directing . . .

Thats not true, Dickerson replied. You just think you are.

Panic set in. What do you mean, I think I am? What, are you hearing this from the same people who told you I was failing my classes? Is Dr. Whitaker telling you this, since hes waiting for you in the hallway? This is a bunch of lies!

Kurt, she replied, you arent doing these things.

Yes, I am! I snapped. I brought out the recording of the Sixteen Feet concert.

This is the tape of the a cappella groups performance. I sang the first song! Get a tape recorder, and Ill play it for you.

Well, obviously it is! I have a recording of me singing in a concert that you say never happened!

I was losing control of myself. With each lie shot downyou dont have a diagnosis, you havent had all the tests, youre not functioning academically, youre not functioning socially, youre imagining everythinganother popped up.

Wait a minute. Have any of you told Dr. Naarden this stuff about me not functioning socially and academically?

Hes been made aware of the problems youre having, Dickerson said.

I took a few panicked breaths. If I went home with a fictional label of having had a breakdown, Naarden would change my treatment plans. He was about to start the switch of my second-line drug from phenobarbital to Mysoline that month. If he heard Swarthmores imaginary stories, that wouldnt happen. I knew he would believe that the new medicine he had added recently, Dilantin, was causing these fantasies that were being tossed about as fact. I needed to speak to Dickerson, heart to heart. I calmed myself, then looked her in the eye.

Dean Dickerson . . . Janet . . . please hear what Im about to say. I cant go home with these falsehoods. If Dr. Naarden thinks Im flunking all my classes and wandering around school drooling, all the planned medication changes and tests will be postponed. He cant treat somebody whos going crazy. Hes going to think the medicine is causing these problems, and theyre not happening! I have a social life, a lot better than most of the people on this campus. I have friends. Im doing lots of things. And you know Im not failing my classes.

I saw sympathy in her face. Was I getting through? Was she reconsidering? I barged ahead, clinging to that hope, yet I couldnt subdue my anger and frustration.

This is the first time in two years that Ive started to get under control, I said. With the next medication changes, I should get even better. But Naarden wont make the changes unless I can disprove everything youre saying about me. Goddamn it , if I cant prove this is all false, he might take me off Dilantin! This not functioning socially, not functioning academically is going to become part of my medical history! Decisions about my care are going to be based on lies!

I closed my eyes. Please dont do this to me.

Her tone hardened. We have an obligation to the parents who paid for their children to have a normal education.

The words drove through my heart. Never had such an agony stabbed at my spirit. Tears filled my eyes. So, what, because people see me have a seizure, Im robbing them of a normal education?

This is just a very upsetting situation for students.

Okayokay, Im sorry, I stammered in desperate sincerity. I never should have started walking the campus alone. I was wrong! Ill stay in my room. No one will have to see them.

My mother cried. Dont punish him because hes epileptic.

Were not, Dickerson said. But we have to think of the other students. And staying in your room doesnt solve the problem. Then youre leaving it to your roommates to deal with it. They have the right to a normal education too.

Everything Dr. Nicholson warned me about was true. It was true. Im just a thing. Im . . .

I covered my face with my hands and sobbed. How can you say these things to me? When you started as dean, all you talked about was diversity.

Suddenly I got angry. Well, here I am! Im diversity. How many people do you have on this campus with disabilities other than me? One? You say diversity, and you want to throw half of Swarthmores disabled students out of school!

Thats what you just said! You guys have given reason after reason for throwing me out. Dr. Whitaker, a goddamn psychologist, says my neurologist doesnt know neurology as well as he does. Oh no, its because of my grades! Oh, its because of my social life! Im imagining my social life! Im hurting other people because they might see me have a seizure!

I stopped speaking, trying to control myself. Dickerson looked pained.

The room went silent for a moment. Let me speak to Dr. Millington, Dickerson said.

They walked into the hallway where Whitaker waited. I wondered what role he had played. I knew he spun stories and bragged about himself all the time. Maybe I had just become a target for him so he could show off to the administration.

My mother and I sat in silence until Dickerson and Millington returned. We still think its best to she began.

No! I wailed. Youre wrong. Youre wrong. If you just want to get rid of me, if you just want me out because of my epilepsy, then just say so

Then there is no issue! Sending me home will set my treatment back. It will make things worse, not better.

My mind shot to my summer in Chicago, when a similar clash over my condition had played out. A neurologist and a psychiatrist each proclaimed their diagnosis, declared the others woefully inadequate, and then threw up their hands sayingsince the other doctor was wrongthere was nothing they could do.

If you just want me out, please just say so. But dont send me home with these false stories about failing my classes and having no social life. Please dont do this to me.

Dickerson appeared as if she wanted to cry.

After several more minutes of rambling, I ran out of words. The room fell silent. Dickerson and Millington excused themselves, then again headed out to where Whitaker was waiting. Minutes ticked by. Only Dickerson returned.

I pushed my hands through my hair as I sobbed uncontrollably. Dont do this to me. Please dont do this to me. I cant go through this again!

Im not up to this anymore, I cried. I know Im going to give up. Im not going to be able to keep fighting to get treated. I cant.

Dickerson stayed silent, appearing to consider my words.

Please, I begged. I cant handle this. Its going to destroy my care. Its going to destroy me.

A pause. Were willing to take that risk, Dickerson said.

The dean ordered me to leave campus directly from the health center. She promised I could return the following semester if I wanted, but I felt certain she was not telling the truth.

I was crushed, beaten. I knew I would be forced to combat these falsehoods, to once again prove my sanity, for Naarden to continue my treatment plan. I could barely move, much less talk. My mother and someone else helped me to the car. We drove to the Media Inn. Back in her room, I asked about returning to school to collect my things and say goodbye to my friends.

We cant, Kurt, my mother said. Youre not allowed on campus.

Something crackedmy resolve, my fortitude. Nothing made sense. I grabbed a plastic box off a table and threw it against the wall, smashing it to pieces.

What the fuck? I screamed. I cant go back on campus? What am I, fucking Hitler? Im so fucking horrible, if anybody even sees me theyre going to fall over dead?

Nicholson was right! He told me if I didnt hide, Id get destroyed. All of you told me to be open! Look what fucking happened! I cant go back to school! I cant pack my clothes! I cant say goodbye to my friends!

My rage knew no bounds. I ranted , threw more things, and collapsed on the floor in tears. My mother stroked my hair as she told me she was going to call my brother at Harvard. She needed help. This was more than she could handle alone.

I dozed off in one of the beds but awakened with a start the next morning, my mind throbbing with rage. Eric arrived and tried his best to calm me. My mother knew I trusted Millington; I had already told her that I believed Whitaker had deceived him. She called Millington and asked him to come to the hotel.

He showed up quickly. Pacing, I launched into the same plea from the night before, my voice cracking with fear that, if I returned home labeled as nonfunctioning, my treatment would be disrupted forever.

Kurt! he snapped, stopping me short. Its over! Just leave, and come back next semester.

Next semester. I knew there would be no next semester. I believed Millington thought it was true. But based on what had already happened, I kneweven if I survived the lonely months at home until the first half of the school year endedSwarthmore had no intention of letting me return.

Kurt! Millington said sharply again. You need to go.

With that, I hit psychological overload. My emotions shut down. I stopped crying. My muscles relaxed. I sat down on a bed. My thoughts cleared.

I ran the situation through my mind. Someone had told my mother that I would try to fool her into believing I was doing fine in class and in social activities. I needed to confirm I wasnt imagining things. Then there was my roommate Carl; he had been pretty rough on me. If I disappeared and never returned, would he get hit with the same self-recrimination I felt for what I had put him through? I couldnt let that happen.

I looked at my mother and Eric. I felt nothing. But Im not leaving until I get a chance to go back and say goodbye to my friends, I said.

The room exploded with shouts of anger and disbelief. I sat stoically, saying nothing as everyone around me fell apart. Someone threatened to have me sedated.

I suppose you could try that, I replied, but Im not going to swallow any pills. That leaves an injection. You can try that, but youre going to have a fight on your hands.

More shouts. Millington stormed out. My mother headed to the bathroom in tears. I approached my brother and sat in front of him.

Eric, Im not asking for much, I said. It doesnt make sense that they wont let me pack or say goodbye to friends.

I noticed he was tearing up.

Eric, I said, I have to go back to school.

A moment passed as he looked me in the eyes. I could tell he saw something; he understood. My mother returned.

Mom, he said, he has to go back to school.

A flurry of phone calls ensued. Finally, the administration compromised. I would be allowed to return before I left, but I could not speak to anyone other than a few friends in my room.

I would be given one hour. If I tried to stay longer or to speak with anyone else, I would be physically removed from campus by Swarthmore security officers.

2018-05-08,Daily Beast,Conspiracy Theory Heres the RFK-Era Decision That Could Take Down Trump,"Whoever commits an offense against the U.S. or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.    18 U.S.C. 2

Legal and linguistic experts have been debating who may have been guilty of criminal wrongdoing arising out of, ironically, the emails, tweets, and blocked phone calls of Donald Trump, his family and staff.

Was it collusionper Webster, a secret agreement between two or more persons for a fraudulent or deceitful purpose? Or perhaps conspiracydefined in legal texts as two or more people agreeing to commit a criminal act when there is an overt act in furtherance of that agreement, not necessarily completion of the crime envisionedis closer. If the Russians were guilty of conspiring to commit specific crimes, how might the Presidents aides and boosters also be?

When I was an organized crime prosecutor in the RFK Justice Department, I tried a criminal case that ultimately went to the Supreme Court, and its ruling sheds light on the current debate regarding these meetings between Donald Trump and others, and with the Russians. The ruling deals with the second section of the federal criminal code noted abovenot some exotic or vaguely defined crime.

I am reminded of that notorious case I tried, and retried, the ultimate conviction upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, because it is relevant to the present debate about collusion v. conspiracy. In U.S. v. Lester, et.al., the government indicted three police officials, two gambling operators, and a lawyer under the civil rights law (18 USC 242) for depriving citizens of their civil rights when acting under color of law. The case involved a conspiracy to falsely arrest and disgrace George Ratterman, a former football star running for sheriff of Newport, Kentucky, then described as a corrupt sin city. Ratterman was running to clean up the town, and the defendants tried to frame him in a compromising act with a stripper.

Our first trial ended in a hung jury. I retried it, and we convicted the lawyer and one of the gambling characters. The jury acquitted the other casino operator (later convicted of another crime) and the three policemen. The case was appealed on the theory that the two who were convicted werent and couldnt be acting under color of law; that standard could only be applied against the three acquitted policemen. Interesting theory.

In 1966, the federal appellate court upheld the conviction of the two men found guilty. But heres the interesting part. It noted in passing that the evidence was sufficient to convict all six. The Sixth Circuit ruled that the two appellants were guilty of aiding and abetting the three police officers. The two convicted defendants could be guilty of aiding and abetting a conspiracy, even if they could not commit the substantive civil rights offense that was the object of the conspiracy.

The appellate court ruled that under 18 USC 2, which by the way is still law, whoever aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal. If he causes an act to be done by him or another, that would be an offense against the United States, and he would be punishable as a principal.

Ignorance of the law, as all know, is no defense. Nor is the incompletion of any planned conspiracy. To quote the court:

...even though a defendant was incompetent to commit the offense as principal by reason of not being of a particular age, sex, condition, or class, he may, nevertheless, be punished as a procurer or abettor.

A recent Politico survey of law professors offered a list of crimes that might result from facts already made public about Russias involvement in the 2016 election: violations of election and campaign financing laws, foreign intelligence activities or cybersecurity prevention laws, wire fraud, something we lawyers call misprison of a felony, false filings and false statements to government officials, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, perjury.

Might the Lester precedent apply to the acts of Donald Trump or Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, their consorting lawyers and staffers in the private sector, the campaign, or the government? If the Russians violated any of the laws, might these Americanspossibly the presidenthave aided and abetted them?

The law that the appellate courts relied on in my case is venerable, going back to the 14th century, and courts have cited modern applications of it. Might the current, up to the moment, breaking news controversy be the latest and most profound application of the Lester case ruling? Depending on what the special prosecutor already knows and the facts and evidence he develops, my old case just might come back to life.

That case was notorious and exciting when we tried it. RFK called and found me and the FBI agent I worked with at the small restaurant in Newport, Kentucky, where we were having our modest celebratory lunch to congratulate us. Now half a century later, might this case turn out to be the precedent to bring down a president?

2018-11-28,Daily Beast,Maria Butina Beau Paul Erickson Finally Lawyers Up,"Paul Erickson, the boyfriend of alleged Russian spy Maria Butina, has retained lawyers in Virginia, The Daily Beast has learned.

Butina was indicted back in July, and the federal charging document all-but-named Erickson in its accusations that Butina infiltrated the conservative movement on Moscows behalf. But Erickson didnt lawyer up until a month or so ago, according to two individuals with direct knowledge of Ericksons affairs. Those sources added that he has struggled to cobble together funds to pay for representation. The former GOP operative appealed to former University of Virginia law school classmates for recommendations on which attorneys to hire, the sources said.

The U.S. attorneys office in South Dakota is currently leading a fraud investigation into Ericksons past business dealings and the FBI has questioned those in his orbit for the last several months, according to three people familiar with the probes.

Hes lying low. Its been several months of this waiting around, a close friend of Ericksons told The Daily Beast. He is a smart guy and understands what could be coming.

Erickson struck up a relationship with Butina, 29, in 2013. Butina, a Russian gun rights activist, attended American University and allegedly worked closely with Russian central bank official Alexander Torshin to influence American politics, according to court records. Butina is currently in solitary confinement in the Alexandria jail on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent.

Throughout the Butina court documents, federal investigators mention a U.S. Person 1an individual Butina worked with, dated and used to make connections with an extensive network of right-wing political figures. That person, who documents say is closely tied to the National Rifle Association, is widely believed to be Erickson.

Despite the ongoing investigations and his reported ties to Butinas activities, Erickson frequently visits her in jail, two individuals with knowledge of the meetings told The Daily Beast. Erickson apparently expressed frustration to friends over the fact that jail staff forced him to sign into the main visitor log, fearing the media would find out.

Several calls and notes to Erickson by The Daily Beast over the last four months have not been returned.

Erickson spent most of his professional life between the Sioux Falls and Washington, D.C. After graduating from the University of Virginia law school in 1988, he worked in various capacities for Republicans, including as a political director on the presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan. During his time working as a political operative, Erickson founded and worked in a handful of different companies, some of which he used to set up fraudulent investment deals, according to court documents.

By the time he met Butina in 2013, Erickson had founded a handful of companies in South Dakota that dabbled in sectors ranging from real estate to patenting. He had solicited hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment for his business ventures.

But he was also in legal trouble, according to court records. As first reported by The Daily Beast in July, several people have sued Erickson in California, Virginia, and South Dakota, claiming he misrepresented himself and his businesses and failed to pay investors back.

Id like to know where the guy is, and how he is making a living, because he owes me a lot of money, a former business partner said.

In one case, according to court records, Erickson claimed to have set up a company in North Dakota. He solicited investment from individuals at the conservative events he frequented, telling them he would set up a real estate transaction that offered high returns. The Secretary of States office in North Dakota told The Daily Beast the company did not exist and one individual sued Erickson in California, alleging he duped him into investing in a fraudulent venture.

One source familiar with Erickson described him to The Daily Beast as kind of like a taller, more physically unappealing Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me if You Can, the movie about a serial scam artist.

Butina and Erickson worked together on several different business deals since 2013, including one that involved Russian jet fuel, according to the New York Times. Erickson and Butina also worked together operating Bridges LLC, a company they registered in 2016 in in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Its unclear from South Dakota records how the company conducted its business.

Around the same time, Erickson reached out to the Trump campaign and suggested setting up a meeting between the candidate and President Vladimir Putin. In a May 2016 email to Trumps campaign adviser Rick Dearborn, Erickson presented himself as someone connected to the Russian government and said he could arrange a back-channel meeting.

The subject line of the message: Kremlin connection."
2018-10-12,Daily Beast,The Awful Things I Saw and Heard at the Border,"As the nation turns its attention from the Supreme Court nomination battle to the midterm elections, national media coverage is dominated by political theater in the fight for control of Congress. In the meantime, a wholly avoidable and self-made humanitarian crisis persists at our border; a crisis deepened by a cruel and vengeful policy that uses the lives of children as bargaining chits in the absence of coherent immigration policy.

There are few things in life that impact a parent like the cries of children. We are conditioned, as a species, to act swiftly to come to the aid of children in duress. After spending a week at the South Texas Family Detention Center in Dilley, Texas, with the Dilley Pro Bono Project (DPBP), I am calling on all parents to actbecause there are thousands of children crying, nearly constantly, for our help.

DPBP works with volunteer attorneys and has two main goals: to provide legal support to asylum seekers so they can get out of the center, and to end the practice of detaining families, and especially, children. The work is intenseconstant legal triageand the stakes could not be higher.

In each moment, I saw, and felt, the maximum extremes of the human condition. I saw impossible despair mingled with fervent hope. I witnessed the most raw and deep pain as I sat with sobbing mothers asking me how they could live knowing that, because they could only afford passage for one child, they had traded the life of one of their children for another.

I felt their relief when the calls back home were answered and they knew the children they left behind were safe, but I could only imagine their heartbreak as they wondered aloud whether they would ever hug them again. I heard the most desperate pleas for help, the most passionate cries to save their babies from the certain death that awaited them upon deportation.

I saw people who yearned to live in a place where they could be safe, and free, and happy. Most of all I saw parents who love their children just as I do mine; who would do anything for their child, including making a dangerous journey across foreign lands, staying in the perrera (dog pound, cages where initial processing occurs) and hielera (ice box, temporary detention facilities near the border) and then detention for the hope of a safer life. I saw lawyers working past the point of exhaustion, running between cases for the chance to help one more woman tell her story.

I saw DPBP staff devote themselves completely to helping the most vulnerable. I heard children crying. I cant recall a single moment in the center without hearing the cries of so many children. This was the worst part, the constant reminder of the suffering of children and the inability to do anything in the moment to make it better (we were not permitted to comfort or play with the children). Mostly I saw suffering. So much suffering.

Most of the families in detention are fleeing persistent, horrific domestic abuse, gang violence, police corruption, political persecution, or a combination thereof. Nearly all face certain death if deported. Rarely is lawyers work a matter of life or death. The gravity of this work is that it nearly always isa negative finding leads to deportation and a return to their perpetrator, so for these mothers and their children, it is usually a death sentence.

The detention center, little more than a low security prison, is horrid. Illness spreads like wildfire, and many children cant eat due to their emotional distress. There is no counseling, and insufficient assistance for the mothers.Our treatment of these families at the border is inexcusable. Our response to children fleeing certain death, after a long, terrifying journey, is to separate them from their parents for processing (yes, we still separate temporarily, and yes, even the little ones), put them in cages, then put them in jail.

I feel so much shame for the abuse we are inflicting on so many children who have already survived so much pain. This treatment is meant to punish and make an example. It is inhumane and un-American and violates the tenets of every religion. It is as far from Matthew 25 as one can imagine (When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?).

There were some good moments. Telling moms they would be leaving detention was amazing. Calling loved ones in other centers and witnessing the relief and joy that they had made it was incredible. The look of confidence and hope on the faces of women who felt heard and validatedoften for the first time in their livesand ready to tell their stories made all of the work worth it.

I will know soon how many women with whom I worked received a positive finding and will leave detention to continue their asylum claims in court. I will enter their alien numbers in the system, but I will see their faces and the faces of their children, as well as the imagined faces in my head of their described families. I will never forget them, and I will never stop praying for them.

Parents: The children are crying. It is time to act to end this terrible practice of detaining children seeking asylum on our shores. Vote for candidates who oppose family detention. Join the immigration justice campaign and visit AILA.org. Volunteer. The lives of thousands of children depend on it."
2018-03-28,Daily Beast,Racist Heineken Ad Pulled After Attack by Chance the Rapper,"Heineken was praised for its salute to diversity in its Open Your World ad campaign last yearwhich featured people of different backgrounds, such as a climate-change denier and an environmental activist, discussing their viewpoints over a beer. But now the company has been forced to pull an advert for its light beer after complaints the commercial was racist, spearheaded by Chance the Rapper.

The bizarre advert showed a bartender apparently spying a woman at the end of the bar and sliding a bottle of beer toward her.

On its travels, the bottle passes several dark-skinned people, including some that appear to be caricatures, such as a black man playing a guitar.

The bottle finally arrives at the hand of a much lighter-skinned woman, before the tag line is delivered: Sometimes lighter is better.

The advert attracted the ire of Chance the Rapper on Sunday night.

Heineken has now announced that it is pulling the commercial, saying that while the ad was referencing Heineken Light, we missed the mark."
2018-04-25,Daily Beast,Big Questions Big Fun Tom Stoppards Travesties Returns to Broadway,"What is art? That is the big, bold, starter for 10 at the heart of the intellectual rollercoaster Tom Stoppard sets in motion in Travesties.

We see it right there, in front of us in Tim Hatleys warrenous set with papers and boxes of papers, and books piled to toppling height. We are to imagine both an apartment and a library, arenas of thoughts and bubbling cultural anarchy. Hidden passageways and entry and exit points sharpen the plays farcical energy.

The 1974 play, which won the Best Play Tony Award in 1976, returns to Broadway in this Roundabout Theatre production. The excellent Tom Hollander gives a hyper-kinetic, beguiling performance as Henry Carr, the low-level English consular official who retells the storyor some kind of story as his flickering memory permitsof when Dadaism founder Tristan Tzara (Seth Numrich), James Joyce (Peter McDonald), and Lenin (Dan Butler) were all based in Zurich in 1917.

Carr puts himself at the center of their activities that year, as the men bustle around the city in and out of the library or Carrs home kvetching, theorizing, and flirting. Travesties lays all their intellectual roustabouts on thick, studded with delightful moments of confrontation and simple confusion. Limericks pop out of mouths, sections of the play come in Joycean rhyme, the acting is delivered with gleeful sides of ham.

Carr keeps calling Joyce womens names, because hes called Joyce. Cecily (Sara Topham) and Gwendolen (Scarlett Strallen) from The Importance of Being Earnest also join the madhouse festivities; Carr is staging the play, which led to a protracted dispute with Joyce that occurred in real life.

We see Carr as a jaunty young man, reveling in being the center of this brainbox circus, and then as an old man, some 50 years later. He is trying to make sense of what happened, doddering around the paper-strewn apartment. For all his puppyish mischief as a young man, Hollander brings considerable, even moving, pathos to Carr as he is losing his grip on his memory and life.

Patrick Marbers dazzling production may still result in befuddlement on the part of the audience. Around this critic, it was evident some of the audience was not getting Travesties at all. Some were finding it roaringly funny, and others were finding some things funny and letting some of its references and arguments wash over them, as Todd Haimes, artistic director and CEO of Roundabout, acknowledges in a note for the shows Playbill.

The line between Travesties and Earnest becomes increasingly blurred, leading to perhaps the funniest moment of the evening, when Cecily and Gwendolen, mired in confusion over Carr and Tzaras respective identities, confront each other over tea. Oh Cecily, oh Cecily, Oh Gwendolen, oh Gwendolen, has never sounded so daintily poisonous as these two wonderful actresses manage to gin up multiple times.

Stoppards wordplay is silly and excellent. Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan? Carr asks Cecily. I know Gilbert but not Sullivan is Cecilys reply.

The debates between Carr and Joyce may be fierce, but the best line Stoppard gives Carr to say to Joyce is: And I have only one request to make of youwhy, for Gods sake, cannot you contrive just once to wear the jacket that is suggested by your trousers?

Joyce is chastened. McDonald says meekly, If I could do it once, I could do it every time. My wardrobe got out of step in Trieste, and its reciprocal members pass each other endlessly in the night.

McDonald plays Joyce as a sober, hard-working writer and poet. The wildness of his prose is not physically evident in his character. For the Ulysses author, An artist is the magician put among men to gratifycapriciouslytheir urge for immortality. The temples are built and brought down around him, continuously and contiguously, from Troy to the fields of Flanders. If there is any meaning in any of it, it is in what survives as art, yes, even in the celebration of tyrants, yes even in the celebration of nonentities.

Numrich as Tzara is all gangly mischief, his leg posed balletically along any bookshelf it can find. Wars are fought for oil wells and coaling stations, for control of the Dardanelles or the Suez Canal, for colonial pickings to buy cheap in and conquered markets to sell dear in.

Carr responds furiously: I went to war because I believed that those boring little Belgians and incompetent Frogs had the right to be defended from German militarism, and thats love of freedom. (Yes, its a free-for-all when it comes to pejoratives describing specific nationalities.)

Lenin and his wife, Nadya (Opal Alladin), are little seen, although he plays a mean lute. One wonderful scene has them arguing in Russian, with Cecily translating for us in English, with all threes heightened emotion intact.

 Art is society! Cecily idealistically maintains. It is one part of many parts all touching each other, everything from poetry to politics. And until the whole is reformed, artistic decadence, whether in the form of the perfectly phrased epigram or a hatful of words flung in the publics face, is a luxury which only artists can afford.

Lenin is more qualified, and more political. Everyone is free to write and say whatever he likes, without any restrictions. But every voluntary association, including the party, is also free to expel members who use the name of the party to advocate anti-party views... Socialist literature and art will be free because the idea of socialism and sympathy with the working people, instead of greed and careerism, will bring ever new forces to its ranks!

No one vision of art has prevailed since 1974, when Stoppard wrote Travesties. In fact, the notion of culture has proliferated more widely than any of the characters imagined. It has leapt from ivory towers, it has cross-pollinated with politics, sport, it has migrated across continents, it has gone high, and it has gone low, it can be both high and low. It powers political debate. It is a financial engine for communities. It is a badge of identity.

Travesties sets up a debate about what art and culture means, then it takes successive pins to the theoretical balloons it casts into the air and opts for some incidental fun instead.

You might find this framing and reframing of big questions, followed by pratfalls and jokes, enlivening or baffling. But Marber and all the actors make Stoppards difficult play ring as clear as it can. Be assured that Travesties also comes to Broadway with a big dance sequence, when all bets are off and when all the characters make delirious fools of themselves.

It is Carr, however, the older version of himself, who has the last word, which focuses again on what art is, and why it matters.

Thats what Travesties answers most resoundingly, even at its most absurd. Travesties insists, with a subversive smile and unapologetic ferocity, that art and artists are far more important and have far greater impact than societythan even eccentric, competitive, priapic artistscan fully comprehend.

Travesties is at the American Airlines Theatre, 227 West 42nd St., New York City. Booking to June 17.

In Lucy Thurbers Transfers, Clarence Mathews (Ato Blankson-Wood) and Cristofer Rodriguez (Juan Castano) both want places at a prestigious university in western Massachusetts. They have an interview coach, David DeSantos (Glenn Davis), who the night before their pivotal scholarship interviews wants them to knuckle down and focus.

Naturally, all three men instead face demons and fall apart. The two boys not only know each other but are linked by a tragic event. They also have a nervous intimacy with one another; Clarence is the quiet, gay cerebral culture vulture, while Cristofer is a hyper, slightly menacing wrestler.

Donyale Werles design is a standout element of Jackson Gays MCC production, with trees looming over a space that transforms from snowbound hotel room to bright, sun-filled offices.

Transfers isnt the first play about the fraught business of college applications either. Admissions at Lincoln Center treads similar territory, but from a very different perspective of white upper middle class privilege and panic.

Here, the panic on the part of the black Clarence and the Latino Cristofer is that they have little to nothing material in their favor. They need these scholarships. Whole directions of lives will be affected by the result, and we see that in the plays denouement.

The play raises urgent questions about fairnessnot just social but in the academic systems selection proceduresbut the volume button on a few of the characters is ratcheted up far too high. The drama becomes blunted when it feels as if we are being shouted at; the stage of the Lucille Lortel feels too small for it.

The tenderness and nuance of Blankson-Wood and Castanos performances, when the boys are left alone to themselves, pondering some very heavy imponderables, give the play its most piercing depth.

Transfers is at the Lucille Lortel Theatre, 121 Christopher St., New York City. Booking to May 13."
2018-07-14,Daily Beast,Anti-Muslim Bikers Target Islamberg New York for National Security,"A group of anti-Muslim bikers and their allies on the far-right will parade by the New York hamlet of Islamberg on Saturday, the latest outgrowth of right-wing conspiracy theory fixations on the small Muslim community.

For the third year in a row, a group organized by American Bikers United Against Jihad will drive by Islamberg, a town of roughly 200 in New Yorks Catskill Mountains, in what theyve dubbed a Ride for National Security. The ride is expected to draw an assortment of right-wing activists, many of whom have been drawn by online hoaxes that portray Islamberg as a terrorist training camp.

The rides organizers insist that they dont intend to break the law. But internal documents posted on a Facebook page for the ride and published by the Southern Poverty Law Center show activists posting anti-Muslim memes, including one that proposes they play cowboys & Muslims.

In its event description, the ride is described as an attempt to prevent the residents of Islamberg from imposing Sharia law on the country.

""We arent going to let them turn this country into a SHITHOLE, the description reads, using President Trumps term for non-white countries in Africa and the Caribbean.

Police said they will provide security around Islamberg during the ride.

For years, Islamberg has been accused in right-wing media of serving as a terrorist sleeper cell or weapons depot  paranoia that ultimately culminated in a foiled plot massacre whom?.

In 2017, for example, hoax news websites pushed the false claim that Trump had ordered a raid on Islamberg that discovered a weapons cache intended for a massive terrorist plot. One site claimed the agents conducting the raid had discovered Americas WORST nightmare.

Attempts to get more information or an inside look at Islamberg have also become frequent topics for right-wing media outlets. In 2015, InfoWars attempted to gain access to the community, even flying nearby with a drone to see inside.

Much of the focus on Islamberg has been fueled by connections between a group its affiliated with, The Muslims of America, and a Pakistani group called Jamaat al-Fuqra that was tied to violence and other crimes in the 1980s.

The Muslims of America and the organizers of the National Security ride didnt respond to requests for comment.

Theres no proof that the current residents of Islamberg are engaged in any crimes or terrorism. A 2008 counter-terrorism analysis from West Point, for example, noted that theres no proof Islamberg is part of a network of covert paramilitary training compounds. An Associated Press reporter who visited Islamberg in 2017 described it as more more country road than backwoods bunker.

Still, Islamberg has become a popular target for anti-Muslim figures. While most of that vitriol has been limited to the internet or the annual security ride, it took a dangerous step towards violence in 2015, when Tennessee man Robert Doggart began trying to put together a hit squad to burn down Islamberg and shoot its residents.

Doggart, who said he wanted to attack Islamberg to get the attention of the American people, attempted to assemble a team of 20 expert gunners who could shoot Islamberg residents and burn down the communitys mosque.

We will be cruel to them, Doggart said at one point in the planning stages, according to court records.

Doggart was convicted and sentenced to almost 20 years in prison in 2017.

While its unclear who will attend the Islamberg ride, previous rides have drawn in groups and personalities from across the far-right. Past rides have drawn in militia-type groups like the III%ers, while the 2017 riders included a bullet-proof vest-wearing member of the Proud Boys, the rowdy group of Western chauvinists created by Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes.

Despite the fervor on the online fringe about Islamberg, the actual number of riders going by Islamberg tends to be on the small side. In 2016, for example, the Islamberg riders were outnumbered by hundreds of counter-protesters."
2018-10-01,Daily Beast,Kanye West Lashes Out at Liberals in TMZ Rant Yall Cant Bully Me,"Kanye West spoke about the power of love, Donald Trump, the 13th Amendment, and more in an interview with TMZ boss Harvey Levin on Monday.

After Yes much-maligned appearance on Saturday Night Live this past weekend, where he went on a post-credits rant about Donald Trump and accused people of bullying him, the rapper sought to clarify those comments and others while in conversation with the gossip maven.

Ye revealed that it was members of his own team who allegedly bullied him about his now-ubiquitous Make America Great Again hat and pro-Trump leaningsnot SNL cast members, who resigned themselves to standing impassively behind Ye during the credits sequence. Ye also told Levin that SNL producer Lorne Michaels promised him a hosting gig later in the season, which would be lit.

Im a little bit missing my calling, Ye said to Levin. Im so funny.

From there, the interview quickly devolved into Ye ruminating on race, modern politics and masculinity. The Chicago-born rapper recently called the 13th Amendment slavery in disguise, but explained to Levin, after some prodding, that he was actually referring to the provision in the 13th Amendment that allows for involuntary servitude to be used punitively. Ye clarified that he wanted to amend the amendment, ostensibly to remove this provisionnot abolish it, as hed previously said. Whats beautiful about our Constitution is we can amend it, he observed.

Ye seemed entranced with the idea of a governing body to help amend and improve the Constitution. There should be a group of super-knowledgeable people that come from all cultures that then make the amendments on our Constitution, Ye told Levin, seemingly unaware that a similar group of peopleCongressalready exists.

But when Levin pressed him to explain his stance on the 13th Amendment, Ye went on a tangent about how time is used to control humanity and humanitys energy, and ultimately dodged the question, citing obscure, likely erroneous, facts about African-Americans and slavery. You can never stop me. I will keep going, he told a dumbstruck Levin, who had tried to correct some of Yes earlier erroneous statements regarding the number of slaves during the 1800s. This is what liberals often do to Donald Trump, Ye pointed out, accusing Levin of trying to pull Ye into a place and quibble over facts.

Kanye had no trouble reconciling his apparent love of Donald Trump and MAGA apparel with his identity as a black man. My culture definitely is hip-hop. Because thats something [African-Americans] made up. My culture is hip-hop. And hip-hop... we can take negative things and make them positive, he said. Ye seemed convinced that leading with love was the most productive way to tackle the bigoted, frequently racist or sexist ideologies propagated by Trump. Theres no way to start a dialogue with fuck you, he told Levin, ignoring the fact that Trump and his supporters use increasingly vitriolic rhetoric in their own arguments. But for Ye, thats not how you lead with love.

Love was the central principle Ye kept returning to during his interview, aside from the brief moments where he discussed his upcoming album (to be recorded in Africa and released on Black Friday of this year, despite a tweet from this past weekend saying otherwise) and his plans to bring flying cars (also known as drones that you could put humans in, per Ye), among other things, to underprivileged children in Chicago.

But the conversation inevitably returned to the rappers controversial politics. You set me up to win, Ye said to Levin when the latter asked him again about his support of Trump, after mentioning that hed invited Colin Kaepernick to meet with the president at the White House.

Ye, who mentioned hed stopped taking his medication, seemed to think that all Trump needed was a little love. We never give up on anyone, he preached. We move forward, we give love, we keep going, we keep having the conversation until the conversation turns to love. And when asked if he thinks Trump would wreak serious havoc on the nation before leaving office, Ye smiled. The universe is on our side, and things will be better, he said. Towards the end of the interview, Ye grew introspective. He frequently referred to himself as a child prodigy and reflected on his transition from a crazy rapper to a father.

Levin quickly turned the focus back to Yes support of Trump. In this video game called life, theres two buttons you hit, Ye said after a moment of thought. The love button, and the fear button. He advocated, of course, for love, and even urged the crew members to say I love you, Harvey, as an apparent manifestation of loves power.

Is there something you love about me? Ye asked Levin, smiling coyly.

I would love it if you could take that hat off, Levin replied without missing a beat, motioning towards the red MAGA cap Kanye had sported for the whole interview. The rapper quickly turned dour.

I am American, and I support and give my ideas and support and brilliance to whoever ends up in office, Ye ranted. Thats my stance, as an American. I support our president, bottom line, no matter who they are. [What] this [hat] represents to me [is], yall cant bully me.

It doesnt mean Im being Donald Trump, Ye had said of his controversial hat earlier in the interview. Im being me, Im being punk, and I can wear whatever I want because Im a god."
2018-04-29,Daily Beast,Is It OK to Stage-Assassinate Katie Hopkins,"MOLD, WalesThough the playwright doth protest, there is an unmistakable glee that permeates a new musical stage production featuring the brutal murder of right-wing controversialist Katie Hopkins.

If you are not familiar with her work, Hopkins is a British iteration of Ann Coulter who started out as a brash contestant on the U.K.s non-celebrity version of The Apprentice, hosted by Alan (Lord) Sugar.

In the opening scenes of The Assassination of Katie Hopkins by Theatr Clwyd we learn that she has been gunned down outside the British Media Awards. We dont see the murder on stageinstead we discover what went down gradually via the fractured and sometimes contradictory prism of social media.

What has Katie Hopkins done this time?

The beep-beep soundtrack of updates landing on a hundred distant phoneswhich had begun quietly as members of the audience took their seatsgathers pace and intensity until its replaced by the long, chilling beeeeeeep of a flatlining life-support machine.

Immediately we are plunged into the worlds reaction to her slaying. A message appears on one of two brilliantly conceived sliding digital wallsconstructed from iPhone-sized screensto say that this is an oral history and claim that no words have been changed from the aftermath of the events of June 2018.

Its like Agatha Christies Murder on the Orient Expressbecause there are so many people wanted her dead.

It just goes to show, says one character, There are outcomes, ramificationsIm not saying she deserved it.

Thats a recurring theme. People explaining that theyre not saying she deserved it, but...

Hopkins used her knack for provocation to secure columns in The Sun, then Mail Online and a British radio show, but those opportunities disappeared as her invective became increasingly extreme.

In 2015, after the publication of heart-rending photographs of migrants who drowned while fleeing Syria, she wrote a column describing the refugees as cockroaches under the headline: Rescue Boats? Id Use Gunships to Stop Migrants.

I dont care. Show me pictures of coffins, show me bodies floating in water, play violins and show me skinny people looking sad, she wrote. I still dont care.

These callous remarks and countless morewhether they are part of pro-Trump screeds or claims to Fox News that Britain is being overrun with Islamistshave been widely rejected by many Brits, and her influence has waned as she lost her high-profile columns and stopped making regular national TV appearances.

Nevertheless Hopkins remains a favorite target of the Left, and seats have been selling fast for this production in North Wales. Some of the audience were still shocked by how far the show went, however.

I expected it to be a verbal assassination not an actual deathperhaps that would have been a better road to go down, said Caryl Kennelly. Jo Cox did spring to mind more than once.""

Cox, an anti-Brexit Labour politician, was shot dead in the street by a right-wing activist in June 2016 in the first British political assassination in a generation. She was 41.

Two would-be jihadis were jailed on terrorism offenses late last yearKatie Hopkins was among their proposed targets.

The Theatr Clwyd musical is far from the first work of fiction to controversially imagine the assassinations of public figures. The acclaimed author Hilary Mantel garnered criticism for her short story imagining the assassination of Margaret Thatcher.

Last summer, New York City's Public Theater faced right-wing protests over a production of Julius Caesar whose title (assassinated) character looked like Donald Trump. The recent FX series, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, is rooted in graphic reality, but was also an audaciously stylized journey into the mind of Versace's killer, Andrew Cunanan.

Hopkins has refused to say anything about the Theatr Clywd musical, and she declined to answer questions from The Daily Beast, but acolytes sent an advertising truck to the town of Mold asking whether it would be acceptable to stage a musical about the assassination of Londons mayor Sadiq Khan or another female Labour politician.

The playwright Chris Bush explained before opening night that she took no pleasure in imagining [Hopkins] death.

So, what is The Assassination of Katie Hopkins? A sick, leftist fantasy? An act of professional trolling? A criminal offense? she wrote in an article for the i newspaper. I sincerely believe it isnt any of these things.

The show sets out to explore 21st century efforts to grapple with social media provocateurslike Paul Joseph Watson, Kanye West or Coulterand their equally aggressive detractors. After a fast-paced and inventive start the musical loses its way as it tries to take on too many ideas at oncethe second half in particular should be tightened.

Of course, we are not supposed to be cheering along with the coarsest commentary on Hopkins death, but Bush fails to fully capture both sides of the debate.

The pro-Hopkins voices tend to be less well drawn, their arguments slight or petty. The one character who does take Hopkins sidea charity worker called Kayleigh who is initially reluctant to defend herends up transforming into a dime-store version of her new idol.

While the characters wrestle with months of debate about HopkinsZombie Katie... just wont diea second narrative develops; twelve seasonal migrant workers have died in a fire at a trailer park.

We see their emotional memorial service and meet the grieving fiancee of one of the victims; there is no such glimpse into the mourning Hopkins clan which includes three young children.

While the musical is certainly not arguing that anyone deserves to lose their life, it does toy with the idea that Hopkins deserved it more than most.

The Assassination of Katie Hopkins is at Theatr Clwyd, Mold, until May 12. Book here."
2018-11-30,Daily Beast,Today Correspondent Jeff Rossen Leaving NBC,"NBC announced internally on Friday that Rossen, Todays national investigative correspondent, will leave the network in mid-January, three sources told The Daily Beast. Two sources with knowledge of Rossens departure said he couldnt come to agreeable terms with NBC on his contract after it expired last week. A network source said he is leaving on good terms.

Rossen, 42, has been a fixture on the show for six years where he hosts the recurring segment Rossen Reports, which focuses on consumer segments such as The 1 simple trick to help you find your lost cell phone. NBC is letting Rossen take his branded segment with him, according to one source, and he is already in talks with other broadcasters about finding it a new home.

Over the past year, Today has been roiled by high-profile personnel changes following Matt Lauers firing last November after a complaint of sexual harassment. Megyn Kelly, the host of Todays third hour, Megyn Kelly Today, is leaving the network after she questioned why it was inappropriate for whites to dress in blackface on Halloween. (Shes negotiating her exit with the network.) Don Nash, the show's longtime executive producer, left in January.

NBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
2018-08-16,Daily Beast,Aretha Franklin Dead at 76 A Queen Who Embodied Black Musics Spirit and Vision,"She was an icon. A legend. And so much more than that.

Aretha Franklin was one of our greatest treasures; a prodigious talent and studious craftswoman who reached the pinnacle of her profession and became a cultural avatar at a time when black women were fighting to be seen and heard on their own terms. Arethas ascent to superstardom coincided with Black Americas cultural assertion against white supremacy in the 1960s, and carried over through the disillusionment and disenfranchisement of the 70s. In the 80s, she embodied her generations shift into newer modes of communication and higher symbols of affluence, and emerged as a venerated elder for a new wave of soul queens in the 90s. Aretha was always a voice and a mirror for where her people and her generation had been, were currently, and seemed to be going.

On Thursday morning, the news came: The Queen of Soul was dead at age 76 from advanced pancreatic cancer.

Its fairly easy to rattle off the names of the legendary soul singers who have followed her path to superstardom. Gladys Knights commercial breakthrough with the Pips was a few months after Aretha broke big with I Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You), and Patti LaBelles solo emergence was similarly post-Aretha in the 1970s, as well as the debuts of Natalie Cole and Chaka Khan with Rufus. Arethas shadow over the singer-songwriter movement most often associated with artists like Joni Mitchell and Carly Simon gets less acknowledgement, but Aretha penned the classic Dr. Feelgood in 1967 and top five hits Think and Sweet Sweet Baby in 1968. She would write a string of hit originals in the early 70s, including Call Me, Rock Steady, Day Dreaming, and Spirit in the Dark. And her skills as a pianist placed her squarely at the cusp of that burgeoning singer-songwriter shift that would be more evident throughout that decade.

Dont play that song for me... cuz it brings back memories of days I once knew...

Shed been raised in gospela teenage phenomenon with an amazing voice, coaching by her father Rev. C.L. Franklin, and piano skills shed taught herself as a youngster learning by ear. Rev. Franklin, the head of New Bethel Baptist Church from the 1940s until the 1979 home-invasion and shooting that left him comatose, showcased his daughter prominently and landed her a deal with JVB Records. Her debut album, a live recording from New Bethel called Songs of Faith, was released when she was only 14.

Her upbringing and ambitions were reflective of the times. She was a part of a generation of black baby boomers who were still very much tethered to the black church tradition but saw the chance for broader reach. Following the maneuvers of her mentor/hero Sam Cooke, Aretha would make the leap to secular music and eventually land a deal with Columbia. But after signing with Columbia and John Hammond, Aretha melded that strong gospel tradition to jazz techniques, and in doing so, began forging her own path musically. She reached even further into these seemingly disparate styles in a way that felt organiceven as she dabbled in a little bit of everything, from doo-wop to supper jazz to pop. It made for sporadic success on the label for the young would-be star, as she charted internationally and on the R&B charts.

But as girl groups and Motown and Stax were scaling the chartsdebunking previous ideas about what a black artist could be in the pop worldArethas success paled in comparison. Whats often downplayed regarding Franklins pre-Atlantic Records days: She was a vital, captivating performer onstage and in the studio and was becoming a successful recording artist. And in her amalgamation of jazz refinement and soul grit, she was bringing varied sonic imprints of black music into the same sphere at a crucial time in the history of black music. But she just wasnt quite there yet in terms of stature.

I had told everybody in the world, Im going on The Ed Sullivan Show! she recalled to Interview magazine in 1986. I had the most beautiful gowns, I was going to sing Skylark [originally released by Aretha in 1963]. I had worked with [choreographer] Cholly [Atkins] on thatand we had done the rehearsals. I remember one of my gowns was cut a little low and a voice from up in the booth said, We dont like the cut of the gownchange it. So we brought out two others that were higher-cut and they seemed satisfied with those, but then at the last minute they said the show was overbooked and somebody had to be bumped, and that it was me.

Of course, her leap to the forefront of music would happen after leaving Columbia for Atlantic and teaming with Jerry Wexler, heading down to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, recording at FAME Studios and releasing the towering I Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You) in 1967. Arethas chemistry with the Swampersthe legendary musicians who played on so many classic records made at FAME Studioswas instantly potent. That burst of inspired creativity occurred despite the discord outside the studio, with Arethas then-husband/manager Ted White butting heads with FAMEs Rick Hall. Swampers bassist David Hood remembered that recording in a 2014 interview with Alabama.com: That session was the one where the falling out between Rick Hall and Aretha and Ted White, Arethas husband, and Jerry Wexler all happened. So I was there when all that stuff went down even though I was not at the hotel when they supposedly got in a fight.

Despite the turmoil, I Never Loved a Man... became Arethas breakthrough. After that leap, she became a sensation, racking up hit albums and singles at a dizzying pace over the late 1960s. Respect, Chain of Fools, You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman, and albums like Lady Soul and Aretha Arrives made her one of musics biggest artists at a time when the civil-rights movement and womens liberation were reshaping the national consciousness. And in those heady 1960s of assassinations and aspirations, Aretha was a black woman who owned every bit of what that meant in sound and on stage; she presented it to the world as the decade transitioned from black-and-white beehives to technicolor afros, and she was graceful in her realnessalways a mix of some jazz with some blues. But the prickliness of fame was evident immediately. When she appeared on the cover of Time magazine in June 1968, she was incensed that the accompanying story presented her as a battered woman, suffering at the hands of White, who shed married at 19.

After the Time story, the scrutiny of the media would be become something Aretha Franklin sought to skirt most of her career. Even as one of the most iconic artists in the world, she was never there to court press. Her adolescenceshed become pregnant twice as a teen, her sometimes-troubled relationship with her father, rumors of body issueswas often something she wouldnt broach in interviews. The coverage could be unyielding. Sometimes that coverage was peppered with brazenly racist descriptors, even while praising her. Last night, a chunky 5ft 5in 28-year-old Negress called Aretha Franklin, known to her admirers as Lady Soul, stampeded her way through her first London concert for three years at the Hammersmith Odeon... opened a 1970 Guardian review of one performance.

Her stature didnt waver as the 1960s gave way to the 1970s and her marriage to White acrimoniously ended. The Time cover, the medias pronouncement of Aretha as The Queen of Soul, her hits Respect and Natural Woman becoming anthems for a generation of womenit all affirmed Aretha Franklin as an artist reshaping and reflecting her times. Even a shady promoter in Fort Myers, Florida, paid a 27-year-old woman named Vickie Jones to impersonate her in 1969. She was a twentysomething star with so much ahead of her, but calling her a Queen was already appropriate since her greatness demanded nothing less.

Drummer Bernard Purdie recalled recording Arethas live 1971 live Fillmore West album. I never witnessed anything like that because, Im telling you, we literally rose off of the floor, he said in 2014. When we made that record, we were on another planet. The people could drown you out... There was nothing but pure love in that room and that house, those three nights, there was nothing like it. I dont think Ill ever see it again but Ill never forget it.

I dont think Ill ever see it again but Ill never forget it.

And Aretha recognized how she moved people and why it mattered that a vlack woman had her kind of platform. She covered Young, Gifted and Black by Nina Simone for her uber-personal album of the same name in 1972 and shared a friendship with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whom she described in 2014 as ...a lovely man; he was certainly a great man, as we all knew. A man of class, integrity, and great courage. And she praised the release of the King biopic Selma as it related to the civil unrest following the killings of Eric Garner and Mike Brown that same year. I think most importantly the timing... what was happening way back then, and what is still happening now. I think the timing is a very important factor and that the film is going to underscore that and other things as well.

In the early 1970s, after activist Angela Davis was arrested and charged with murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy for allegedly supplying arms to revolutionary Jonathan Jackson and his cohorts for an attempted courtroom escape to free his brother, revolutionary leader George Jackson, Aretha voiced her support.

My daddy says I dont know what Im doing, Aretha said at the time. Well, I respect him, of course, but Im going to stick to my beliefs. Angela Davis must go free. Black people will be free. Ive been locked up and I know youve got to disturb the peace when you cant get no peace. Jail is hell to be in. Im going to see her free if there is any justice in our courts, not because I believe in communism but because shes a black woman and she wants freedom for black people. I have the money; I got it from black peopletheyve made me financially able to have it. And I want to use it in ways that will help our people.

Aretha had been locked up for drunk driving in 1968 and for causing a disturbance in a Detroit parking lot in 1969. After she posted the $50 bail for the parking lot incident, she angrily ran down a road sign outside the police station. She was a rebel with a cause, and even at her mainstream peak, she made it clear where she stood.

Lets call this song exactly what it is...

Her career would see somewhat expected dips (first during the mid-70s dawn of disco and then again as the new jack swing era in the late-80s revamped R&B for a new generation) but Aretha remained musically vital even throughout changing times. She bounced back a first time with the Curtis Mayfield-penned Sparkle soundtrack before a cold spell in the late-70s led to a second comeback after leaving Atlantic for Arista, scoring 80s hits like Jump to It and Freeway of Love. Aretha had navigated the waters of pop music middle-age better than most of her peers, save Tina Turner, and again seemed to embody her entire generations journey. She was vital and visible in her forties in the age of black upward mobility and urban chic; and by the 1990s, she had become regarded as one of musics pre-eminent matriarchs. For stars like Mary J. Blige and Jill Scott, she was a blueprint on which they could draw entire musical identities. Her soulful expression rerouted an entire genre.

The Queen of Soul is a lofty moniker. Such designations are typically fairly empty. Aretha Franklin has been that for decades, but shes always been more. Shes been our sister and our auntie. Shes been the sound of block parties and barbershops and the sound of Carnegie Hall and the Fillmore. Shes a lightning bolt through music history that ties together so many strands of black experience and sound. You almost have to view music through the lens of before her and after her. And she did it all as she reflected us. The grand and the gutsy. A little bit of jazz with a little bit of blues. And all soul."
2018-05-03,Daily Beast,The Transgender Conservatives Who Are Sticking With Trump,"Just over a week before the 2016 election, presidential candidate Donald J. Trump walked out on stage at a rally in Greeley, Colorado. He pointed to someone in the crowd, who handed him a rainbow flag with LGBTs for Trump scrawled on it in black marker pen. He unfurled the crumpled nylon and held it up with a grin.

The flag was upside down. For many of Trumps LGBT and LGBT-allied critics, it was to prove a telling portent. The administration has since moved to enshrine a number of anti-LGBT policies, with the socially conservative Mike Pence reportedly driving the agenda.

However, for Jazmine Jannelle, a 61-year-old trans woman from Chicago, the rainbow flag moment was symbolic of a president who acknowledges common ground with many different people.

Jannelle is one of a devoted group of transgender Trump supporters who are backing the president despite his anti-trans policy initiatives, his desired military ban at the ugly forefront.

Transgender Trump supporters in 2018 find themselves in a uniquely isolated position. They face being cast out from their communities and families for being transgender, while others in the LGBT community cannot understand how they can be pro-Trump.

Its a constant battle, said Coco Haynes, a 58-year-old trans woman from Evart, Michigan. Every day people question whether Im transgender. They see me as a fake. They call me a liar.

Admitting you have conservative views is often referred to in the conservative LGBT community as coming out for a second time.

As activists and federal judges battle President Trump over the proposed ban on transgender individuals joining the military, his transgender supporters are disappointed.

When Haynes woke up to the first news of the transgender military ban back in July 2017, she was mad as all hell. She had served in the Air Force for 21 years, and she had never let her identity affect her job. In fact, she kept it hidden. I buried it so deep, she said. I lived in a shell.

Haynes wrote a letter to the president expressing her anger and disappointment in the ban.

He has to learn that this is important, she said. If he doesnt change his ways and start appreciating the community, hes in trouble.

But Haynes will give Trump her vote again in 2020, on the condition that he mends his ways with transgender people. I expect him to do the right thinghes an honorable man, she said. Haynes believes Trump is surrounded by confused people such as Vice President Pence.

Haynes is not alone in looking at Trump as separate from his administration.

Pence isnt in the same ballpark as Donald Trump, said Tonya Rogers, a 52-year-old trans woman from Dallas. I cannot stand that sack of shit.

Rogers, who is also an Air Force veteran, is disappointed by the military ban and is still trying to process it.

I cant think of one good reason why [transgender people] cant be in a non-combat position, she said. But she remains confident that Trump is still a good president. Its not in his nature to be discriminatory, she said. Where this stuff is coming from is beyond my imagination. Its coming from someone other than Trump.

Rogers believes that Trump has been subject to pressure from Christian groups to pass anti-LGBT legislation. She does not accept that the administrations stance comes from a place of intolerance on the part of Trump himself.

Trumps trans supporters dont deny the transgender military ban has been a blow. But they are still in support of the presidents stance on gun laws, immigration, economic policy, and constitutional rights.

I dont push for trans rights, I push for my personal rights, Rogers said. Our economy is doing fantastic, people are getting bonuses.

Rogers has admired Trump ever since she read The Art of the Deal when it came out in 1987. In the period after she embraced her trans identity in 2013, the unapologetic figure of Trump was an inspiration for Rogers at a time when her family members refused to recognize who she was or call her by her new name.

Trumps personality really has a lot in common with a transgender personality, she said, reminiscing about the time when she first wore makeup in public and chose a bright blue eyeshadow. A lot of us want to shock the hell out of people. Trump doesnt try to blend in. I can look at him and I can tell who he is. Hes a wild child. I love that.

Trans conservatives use Facebook as a way to feel less isolated and more connected with others who share the same views and experiences living as both conservative and transgender.

As far as support, there is very little from anyone. Most of my trans conservative friends are from Facebook, Rogers said.

Social media is a place where she can find support and solidarity when it is missing from her daily life. She is a member of several groups for conservative transgender people, most of whom are white women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s who have come out in the last five years.

The number of transgender Republicans wasnt huge before Trump. According to a survey carried out by Transequality, 2 percent of transgender respondents called themselves a Republican in 2015. But Haynes believes that transgender women like herself now form a significant group within Trumps supporter base.

She feels rejected by younger gay, lesbian, and transgender people. Were the bastard children of the LGBT community, she said.

Haynes credits the Obama administration for creating an environment for her to feel safe about coming out. But she voted for Trump after she was deeply disappointed with Obamas military leadership.

Haynes lives off a combination of military retirement pay, Social Security, and disability benefits. My money was worth squat under Obama. I was paying all these taxes. Hopefully next year I wont have to pay so much.

Haynes is delighted by Trumps first year in office. I applaud him for 99 percent of what hes doing, she said. Hes doing whats right for the country. Things like the North Korea deal are a heck of a lot more important than my gender. In the big picture, Im nothing. Sometimes you need to make sacrifices.

For Trumps transgender supporters, these sacrifices outweigh the curtailing of their rights.

The isolation of having spent most of their lives as secretly transgender has been intensified by the isolation of being an open Trump supporter.

When Trump took office, Rogers noticed that a lot of her LGBT friends unfriended her on Facebook. She said people told her they didnt want any kind of communication from someone who supported Trump and his policies.

They preach diversity and they preach that everybody should be loved, she said of her liberal LGBT peers. Theres hate coming from both sides. Rogers was recently verbally abused by an evangelical Christian on a bus in Dallas. But seeking help from her local transgender support group, Transcendence, wasnt an option. She said, Once they found out I was conservative, they banned me from going.

The group doesnt deny it. There have been people who have been asked to leave the group in the past because theyre contributing to a toxic atmosphere and cause division, said Katelyn Smith, a representative at Transcendence Dallas. Unfortunately being transgender in Texas is a really political thing, but we try not to speak a lot about politics.

Rogers isnt alone in finding herself trapped between conservatives and the LGBT community.

Heather Dunn, a 35-year-old trans woman from Nevada, Iowa, has spent much of her life feeling ostracized from her evangelical Christian peers, who chastised her first after she came out as bisexual, and later when she came out as trans.

Dunn remains convinced that unlike Christian conservatives, Trump is committed to LGBT issues. She went from being a self-proclaimed never-Trumper to a supporter during the campaign when she noticed that, unlike former Republican presidential candidates, Trump said LGBT instead of homosexual.

But she feels spurned by her liberal LGBT contemporaries for being a Trump supporter. It hurts because I identify with this community, but sometimes it feels like the doors do not fully open unless Im silent about what I really believe, she said.

Sue Hyde, a director at the National LGBTQ Task Force, said people like Rogers and Dunn should be able to walk into any LGBT community center in the United States and find a warm welcome.

But, she said, given how much anger there is towards Trump and his harmful administration, I would not advise anybody who was a vocal Trump supporter to continue that conversation in an LGBTQ space.

Another issue is hostility from prejudiced conservatives. Edie Dixon, a 31-year-old transgender woman from Portland, Oregon, is careful not to discuss trans issues with her Republican friends. As long as you dont talk about being transgender and playing the victim 24 hours a day, she said, youre fine.

Conservative transgender voters say they will continue to support Trump so long as he continues with his current economic and military policies. However, as Trumps military ban continues to enrage the transgender community, many of his trans supporters feel its time Trump started to take notice of them.

We supported him when he needed it, and now he needs to support us, said Coco Haynes.

Many, like Haynes, want to see him take the kind of stance on transgender issues he did during his campaign, when Trump appeared to condemn North Carolinas bathroom bill and said he would be happy for Caitlyn Jenner to use any bathroom she wanted if she visited Trump Tower.

While he was running he wanted our support, so he had an interest in us, said Haynes. But that changed. Obama opened the door, and now were out, were not going back in. Trump has to learn that were not just a hundred guys and girls. We are thousands."
2018-03-06,Daily Beast,Exiled Russian Billionaire Khodorkovsky on the Real McMafia Vladimir Putin and Political Murders,"LONDONRussias former richest man and longtime prisoner, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, wearing slightly threadbare jeans and a thick sweater under his jacket, was making coffee in his office on Hanover Square. Snow was falling outside, covering the British capital with a wet, cold blanket a little reminiscent of Moscow, and there is no doubt that is where Khodorkovskys thoughts were as we talked.

Earlier in the day, last Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin had boasted to the Russian parliament about the countrys new nuclear weapons, which are capable, he said, of destroying millions of lives at the speed of a meteorite.

Khodorkovsky, adjusting his rimless glasses, said quietly that Putins speech had left him shocked: Sounds like the old man is out of his mind, something needs to be done about that.

While Putin spoke about war and death, his audience full of Russian officials was applauding, beaming with idiotic smilesI was disgusted to see that, Khodorkovsky said in an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast.

One wouldnt have expected him to speak kindly of the Russian president, whom Khodorkovsky has known for many painful years.

In 2003, when Khodorkovsky was head of the oil giant Yukos and reputed to have a personal fortune of some $15 billion, he showed up at a Kremlin meeting without a tie (seen as a sign of disrespect) and confronted Putin in front of everybody there: Mr. President, your officials are bribe takers and thieves. Since then, it is said, Putin has never forgiven Khodorkovsky for that declaration, despite the factor because of itthat many people believe it to be true.

From 2003 to 2013 the erstwhile oligarch was locked in Russian prisons and prison camps for alleged tax evasion and theft. Then, five years ago, Putin pardoned Khodorkovsky, and the former oil tycoon left Russia on the first day of his freedom, joining the large population of exiled Russian businessmen here in Londongrad who hope that one day the Russian regime will fall apart.

Through it all, Khodorkovsky was able to preserve something of his fortune, and today he is the richest Russian philanthropist sponsoring independent media, human rights, and investigative projects inside the country, although he does not go back to Russia himself.

One common strategy used to silence opponents and critics of Putin is to level charges of outrageous crimes against them. (One, tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, was tried and convicted for tax evasion after he died in a Russian prison.)

In 2015, two years after Khodorkovsky was released into exile, he was charged with the 1998 murder of Vladimir Petukhov, mayor of Nefteyugansk, a town amid rich oil fields in central Russia. Prosecutors accused Khodorkovsky of hiring an assassin to kill Petukhov 17 years earlier because the mayor had pressured Khodorkovskys company, Yukos, to pay more taxes.

In 2007, a Russian court sentenced the head of Yukos security, Alexei Pichugin, to life in prison for ordering three murders, including Petukhovs. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russian authorities had violated Pichugins rights, but last year the Russian Supreme Court upheld the sentence.

Khodorkovsky has denied his involvement in the murder. His lawyer, Vadim Klyuvgant, refers to the prosecutors accusation as fantasy.

After Khodorkovskys decade in prison he devoted himself to support for Russian civil society. Instead of retiring and enjoying his life on some sunny beach, the former tycoon comes to work every day at his office in chilly London.

As he analyzed Putins most recent speech, Khodorkovsky noted that the kind of nuclear weapons presented in a graphic video accompanying the Russian presidents remarks (many of which were shown converging on Florida) were not really new. Back in the days of the Soviet Union, scientists had talked about the same sorts of weapons but decided not to include them in the states arsenal, Khodorkovsky pointed out, because they could be dangerous to the Russians themselves, and certainly would complicate or thwart what formerly would be good faith efforts to reduce the chances of nuclear war.

In my view Putin demonstrates to us that he is not interested in Russia any longer, he sees himself in the international arena, threatening foreign governments, forcing them to love him, Khodorkovsky told The Daily Beast. That love for Putin that he desires did not happenafter the conflict in Ukraine, after his actions in Syria, nobody felt itso now he says: Here is how I will force you to love me.

Khodorkovsky also has warned his supporters in Russia about the dangers that lie ahead as Putin boasts of invincible ICBMs, cruise missiles, and underwater drones that no other country in the world can stop. Speaking on a video link from London, the billionaire urged his Russian followers that Putin could push the so-called red button at any moment.

Before, I hoped we would never see the Third Word War, but now I am not that sure, he said, then added, speaking figuratively: Guys, lets burn down the throne of this damn czar, then well live normally. To do that, the philanthropist called on Russians to reform the political system, to create a parliamentary republic.

In the interview with The Daily Beast, Khodorkovsky noted that President Putin has never seen war with his own eyes. His aides let him watch too many war movies, he has not seen real war, which this time would mean blood and death all over the planet.

The former head of Yukos, who once knew Putin personally and well, said, It is hard for me to imagine that Putin, whose children live in the West, who knows perfectly well that there is no external threat for Russia, cannot foresee the reaction here to his message: Right now the Wests top politicians and military bosses are rubbing their hands, eager to take Putins message to their voters and ask for moneyand so, the arms race begins.

Indeed, that sense that the Putin speech was a watershed is now widespread, even though U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to comment on it. Russian independent expert Alexander Golts agreed with Khodorkovskys point: Putins horrible message means that the Cold War between Russias and NATOs forces begins right now, Golts told The Daily Beast.

All this is taking place as Russias presidential elections approach on March 18. At this point, Khodorkovsky and his supporters do not doubt that President Putins popularity is solid and a will return him to office for another six years. So Khodorkovsky is preparing his Russian supporters for the 2024 elections, and apparently with more confidence than ever, his messages sounded revolutionary. Paraphrasing Thomas Jefferson, he said, If we do not water the tree of our freedom with blood of patriots and tyrants, it will never bloom.

But in the meantime, in Russia, dozens of opposition activists have been arrested, interrogated, beaten, imprisoned. Khodorkovsky said he expected more arrests to come after the vote two weeks away, but his Open Russia Foundations group of human rights defenders and lawyers will provide legal support to Russian political dissidents.

Khodorkovsky is well aware that other critics and opponents of Putin have been killed under highly suspicious circumstances, not only in Russia, but, in one infamous case, here in Londongrad.

Alexander Litvinenko, formerly with Russian State Security (the FSB) fled Russia, obtained British citizenship, and became a fierce critic of the Kremlin. The FSB (successor to the Soviet KGB) does not forgive what it considers traitors. And in 2006, after Litvinenkos accusations against Putin became increasingly personal and scurrilous, he was poisoned with a fatal dose of polonium-210, a rare isotope put in his tea at a London hotel.

On Monday this week, a Russian intelligence officer who had spied for the West and been given refuge in Britain after he was released by Moscow in a 2010 prisoner swap, was left in critical condition after exposure to an unknown substance, according to British authorities. The agent, Sergei Skripal, had served with the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, before he was caught passing information to Western intelligence that included the identities of Russian agents.

If this does turn out to be an act of vengeance and intimidation, it is certainly a brazen one. Khodorkovsky, in an email, told The Daily Beast, I am not sure which news would upset me more at this point, that Putin cannot control the GRU, or that he is a maniac.

In Russia, Anna Politkovskaya, an award-winning independent journalist for Novaya Gazeta, was assassinated in her apartment building a month before Litvinenko was poisoned in London. In 2015 President Putins most passionate critic, Boris Nemtsov, was shot four times in the back right outside of the Kremlins wall. His assassins are in prison but the mastermind behind his assassination has never been brought to trial.

Earlier this month the British government decided to increase scrutiny of wealthy foreigners, and Ben Wallace, minister of state for security and economic crime, expressed hopes that the BBC/AMC drama series McMafia, which shows elements of the Russian mob working closely and ruthlessly with individuals in the state security service, would increase awareness of global corruption. Khodorkovsky was even invited to give his opinion to Parliament about the series.

He told The Daily Beast he didnt much like it. He said that after watching a few episodes, I told dozens of U.K. members of parliament that the series missed the main point by not showing that the Kremlinand not Russian businessmenis the most dangerous organized crime group, adding with evident emotion, Nobody should forget what happened to Alexander Litvinenko, Anna Politkovskaya, Boris Nemtsov, and other Putin critics.

Millions of educated Russians, including successful businessmen, flee Russia every year. According to the Atlantic Council, about 1.8 million Russian citizens emigrated in the period between 2000 and 2014 . Today some exiled Russian businessmen liable to face criminal charges at home are nonetheless feeling nostalgic, hoping they could make a deal with the Kremlin.

Earlier this month President Putins business ombudsman, Boris Titov, spoke with about 16 rich Russians at Pushkin House in London who seemed ready to return home. Names on the list included Aleksei Bazhanov, a former deputy minister of agriculture and founder of Masloproduct, a factory producing oil and butter; Sergei Kapchuk, a former Sverdlovsk region deputy and owner of a ball-bearing factory; Anatoly Loktinov, former vice president of Russian oil giant Rosneft; and Mikhail Shamanov, owner of several travel companies. All of these individuals had lived in luxurious estates in London while wanted in Russia for fraud, embezzlement, laundering millions of dollars, and other crimes.

The first businessman from Titovs London List to return to Moscow last month, Andrei Kokovkin, was detained immediately by police. Kokovkin, who traded fuel in Rostov-on-Don, was accused of financial fraud. In spite of Titovs promises, the criminal case against him was still opened.

Khodorkovsky, who spoke with several Russian citizens from Titovs list, said that in his opinion Titov was trying lure back a few small and middle level millionaires, who actually do want to return home.

They are not crazy but they are running out of money, said Khodorkovsky, so they want to go back to Russia, where they know how to make money.

Khodorkovsky said that he is convinced that opening and closing of criminal cases in Russia was pure business, like the indulgences offered by the church: It has nothing to do with groveling before Putin, Titov is trying to make a new deal with exiled businessmen, assure them that their cases would be closed now, and then later they would pay the system, Khodorkovsky told The Daily Beast.

But when the first Russian businessman got arrested upon his arrival, said Khodorkovsky, it became obvious to us in London, that nobody in Russia had a huge desire to let Titov change the rules of the market [and] there are no illusions left that the criminal charges against businessmen on the list would be dropped."
2018-08-05,Daily Beast,Dear Liberal Media Stop Pretending Being Poor And White Makes You Racist,"The dapper fascist has been given a makeover. This week The New York Times has advised us on how best to talk to a racist in order to dismantle white supremacy (spoiler: dont call them racists, even if they post racist things on Facebook or visibly cringe when confronted with someone they think might be Muslim), and The Washington Post has informed us that many white people dont like being in situations where they are the racial minority.

This new racist is cast as sympathetic, an inevitable byproduct of a culture of white supremacy in the South or a remote homogenous life that has left him ill-prepared for this terrifying new world where people speak Spanish sometimes, or where shes the only white person in the room. They arent heroes. But, the Times and the Post tell us, theyre people with compelling backstories that forced them to be like they are. They were raised to it, or maybe theyre just poor.

Poverty doesnt make you racist. Its more that the exhaustion strips you of the ability to dissemble for long, so if you were inclined toward racism already, it shows. A life lived close to tears of sheer fatigue and stress is not one in which you can expend the energy to stop yourself spouting your resentments or wielding your fears as a weapon. The constant dull weight of oppressionand it is oppressionmakes you resentful and distrustful. The anger makes hate seem reasonable, and each person must individually decide what to do with that.

Some people choose racism, full stop. Theres no mitigation, no gray area in which otherwise good-hearted people use the same arguments that white Southerners used to discredit Uncle Toms Cabin more than 150 years ago: it couldnt possibly have been that bad. although thats the assertion in the New York Times. There is no such thing as a good-hearted person who believes that slavery wasnt that bad. One does not exist. Such a person might be kind to strangers. They might be of a cheerful and gracious nature. But they are not kind-hearted.

There are many reasons people believe racist things. White supremacy has never gone away, whatever gains racial and ethnic minorities have managed to claim. Unlearning racism is a lifelong process. Some people like cruelty. Others are loath to give up the advantages whiteness confers. Many people have been brought up to hate people who are not like them. None of these are reasons to tolerate bigotry.

We have elevated the least good and great among us to the highest of offices and glorified violence as a political tool. There is no time to waste worrying about the delicate sensibilities of those people who would prefer to enact racism without facing any personal consequences for that decision.

Its true that an increasing conservative monopoly in rural media combined with whatever it is Facebooks been doing for the last few years have resulted in a uniquely uneducated populace. Reality isnt the same thing in the world of Fox News and Infowars as it is for the rest of us. But some things are beyond spin, and few people in the nation havent heard by now about the children in camps at the border.

White people are not inherently good; we are inherently human. We need not pretend otherwise while our racist grandpa talks about shithole countries and calls people animals and the hateful wing of the family cheers and claps along. Some white supremacists march in the streets with swastikas, and others merely call police because they spotted a black person three blocks away enjoying the sunshine too much.

It doesnt matter what you have been taught your whole life; what matters is what you choose when you are confronted with a reality that opposes your education. That capacity to choose justice, to choose even sheer humanity, is not relegated to those who live above a certain income or population density. You can find it in those people who hold their friends and families accountable, the ones who challenge instead of excusing deadly beliefs. You find it in the locals who leave water in the desert for migrants and the single protester in some tiny town holding a hand-lettered sign that says FAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER in front of the courthouse.

Stop making excuses for my racist neighbors. It is not true that people from where Im from have no choice but to continue the same deadly cycles of the generations before us, that we are too simple or unsophisticated to tell right from wrong when the choice between them is so astonishingly clear. There is bravery and right in places where we have been told we will not find them, and we are all responsible for our own moral decisions.

We have replaced the dapper fascist with the relatable bigot, though neither is worthy of praise or consideration. No matter how we rebrand it, there is no way to make bigotry less profane."
2018-09-14,Daily Beast,Ribollita A Taste of Italy Without Leaving Your Kitchen,"While Italy is overrun by tourists in the summer, I dream of going in the fall when its often less crowded. Yes, the weather is a bit cooler and the skies can be gray and rainy, but, with a little imagination, you can pretend to be a local. And thats not to mention your odds of finding a bowl of fortifying ribollita go up.

The traditional Italian soup, which is made with stale bread and white beans, is delicious. Ribollita is a great example of a hearty dish that, despite its humble, inexpensive ingredients, does not compromise on flavor, writes Russell Norman in his new book, Venice: Four Seasons of Home Cooking. The addition of the bread creates a texture that I find deeply comforting, too. Perfect to slurp away those late-autumn blues.

The secret to the recipe is to wait a day before eating it. While its certainly a test of self-control, if youre able to resist temptation youll be rewarded.

2018-10-05,Daily Beast,Its Absurd to Claim That Non-Binary People Are a Security Risk,"Like clockwork, the same myth emerges every time theres progress for non-binary people who want more gender options on their identity documents: Allowing an X option in addition to M and F, the critics say, could pose a security risk.

This time, its a lawmaker in Minnesota who questioned the states recent introduction of a new X option for drivers licenses.

As the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported in their article on the changewhich took effect this MondayRepublican state senator Scott Newman responded in a statement: Will this change hamper law enforcements ability to properly identify suspects, or hinder the investigative process in any way? The public deserves answers to these questions, or at least a dialogue about the potential repercussions.

Fortunately, there are already answers to these questions: No, the growing number of jurisdictions that are issuing non-binary identity documents for people who identify as neither strictly male or female are not going to cause a policing crisis or create a public safety problem.

But thats been the common objection so far. When California was weighing a bill last year that would introduce non-binary drivers licenses, for example, opponents claimed that it could increase identity theft and fraud, as Courthouse News reported.

Those arguments were unpersuasive, as the bill passed by a 26-12 margin in the state Senate and by 57-21 in the Assembly.

When the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles began modernizing its computer systems last year to include a non-binary gender option, questions were raised about the potential impact on law enforcement, as Vermont Public Radio reported in Octoberand initially, there were mixed opinions on the issue, as a member of the Law Enforcement Advisory Board told VPR.

But by January of this year, VPR was able to report that, after studying the issue, no one on the Law Enforcement Advisory Board opposed the addition of a non-binary gender marker to the states licenses, with the Chairman telling VPR that the general opinion around the table was that it wasnt going to impede the way we conducted our business.

In fact, the law enforcement-based objection can be traced back to the very beginning of non-binary legal reform in the United States.

In 2017, Oregon became the first state to allow an X on drivers licensesand as Reuters reported in its coverage, one of the only arguments that public commenters made against the change was that it could complicate police efforts to identify people.

Several public commenters in Washington State beat a similar drum in November 2017 when the Department of Health was considering adding an X option to birth certificates.

Said one objector, Im very concerned that this could hinder law enforcement. Added another, Our law enforcement needs to be able to positively identify all individuals. How will the police describe a missing person especially a child or a suspect in a crime? Someone else asked. Washington added the X this January.

The primary proof that non-binary gender markers dont cause such problems is the simple fact that several states and countries have now added non-binary gender markers to their identity documents without incident.

As the LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal noted in a letter [PDF] sent to the Oregon Department of Transportation when the agency was soliciting comments on non-binary drivers licenses, fears about security threats expressed by opponents of the change have no basis in logic or evidence.

To the contrary, numerous foreign countries and U.S. municipalities have moved beyond binary gender designations without reporting attendant upticks in fraud or crime, Lambda Legal wrote.

Those foreign countriesas the letter notedinclude Australia, Bangladesh, Germany, India, Malta, Nepal, New Zealand and Pakistan. Within the United States, several jurisdictionsMaine, Oregon, California, the District of Columbia, New York City, and now Minnesotaall offer some form of non-binary government documentation. So far, there hasnt been a wave of crooks identifying as non-binary to evade police detection.

Thats not surprising because, as Lambda Legal further noted, people generally dont abuse state policies that allow them to change their name on a drivers license: There is no indication that people helped by these policies (most frequently cisgender people who change their names when married) have used their new identity documents to break the law with impunity, evade debts, or otherwise harm the community.

But its not just anti-transgender commenters, anti-LGBT groups, and the occasional state legislator who have questioned the impact of non-binary gender markers on law enforcement; the State Department has also advanced a similar position in the ongoing legal battle over the possibility of an X on U.S. passports.

Dana Zzyym, a non-binary person who is also intersexmeaning that their anatomy could not be readily assigned male or female at birthapplied for a passport in 2014, listing intersex on the application rather than selecting M or F. Zzymm, who uses the pronouns they and them, received multiple denialsand Lambda Legal sued on their behalf, arguing that Zzymm could not be refused a passport simply because they would not select a sex that did not describe them.

In both of the decisions that have been issued in Zzymms favor so far by District Judge R. Brooke Jackson, the court has debunked the State Departments position that passports need to have binary gender options to match law enforcement databases.

First, in a November 2016 ruling, Judge Jackson pointed out that the State Department offered Zzyym the option of a male passport knowing full well that [they] had state identification documents (and perhaps law enforcement database records?) listing [them] as female.

The State Department also issues updated passports to binary-identify transgender people who, thanks to restrictive state laws, may have law enforcement records that might list that very same passport holder as the opposite sex, Jackson noted.

If syncing passport information to the records contained within law enforcement databases is truly critical for the Department, Jackson wondered, then how could it explain those choices?

And then, this Septemberas The Daily Beast previously reportedJackson again ruled in Zzymms favor, writing that the State Department had failed to add any substantive arguments or evidence in the new material that the agency submitted to the court.

Jackson pointed to the fact that a growing number of states, as well as the International Civil Aviation Organizationa U.N. agency that sets standards for modern passportsnow recognize a third gender option outside of male or female. He also noted that gender is just one of many fields used to crosscheck a passport [applicants] identity, adding that social security numbers, birthdates, names, and other pieces of information can also be used for cross-referencing.

Moreover, Jackson continued, theres the issue of accuracy: Zzyym is intersex and non-binary. What purpose would it serve to force them to choose either male or female? (I find that requiring an intersex person to misrepresent their sex on this identity document is a perplexing way to serve the Departments goal of accuracy and integrity, Jackson wrote, in one of the decisions more scathing lines.)

Indeed, for all the talk about how non-binary documents could potentially make it harder to identify people, the opposite is likely true: Giving non-binary people non-binary gender markers makes the situation clearer for everyone involved.

As Lambda Legal noted in their letter to the Oregon DOT, forcing a person whose gender is non-binary to use an identity document identifying them as male or female subverts rather than promotes accuracy.

So, no, the growing trend of allowing an X on a drivers license is not going to hamper law enforcements ability to properly identify suspects. If anything, more gender options will make it easier to identify people, not harder.

But as more states allow for non-binary gender options in the future, this myth will almost certainly keep coming upand it will be just as false each time."
2018-03-19,Daily Beast,Federal Judges Reject GOP Attempt to Block New Pennsylvania Map,"A panel of three federal judges decided Monday to throw out a Republican challenge against the newly redrawn district map proposed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court last month.

The judges, in their released opinion, determined that they had no authority to step in and therefore decided to toss it.

Because fundamental principles of constitutional standing and judicial restraint prohibit us from exercising jurisdiction, we have no authority to take any action other than to dismiss the Plaintiffs verified complaint, the opinion reads.

The challenge was filed by Jacob Corman, Republican Majority Leader in the Pennsylvania Senate and includes plaintiffs Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA), Rep. Ryan Costello (R-PA), and Rep. Keith Rothfus (R-PA).

The judges released this decision with just a day left before congressional candidates in Pennsylvania have to formally circulate petitions to get on to the ballot for these newly proposed districts in advance of a May primary.

As the opinion laid out, Pennsylvanias General Assembly had until February 9 to submit a new map to Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. The governor rejected it saying that it maintained similar partisan gerrymandering to a 2011 map. Subsequently, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, proposed their own new districts, which divided the state into eight Hillary Clinton-won districts and ten Donald Trump-won districts. The president won Pennsylvania by less than a point in 2016.

While the United States Supreme Court has still yet to address a separate challenge against the new map, this deals a blow to the Republican efforts to halt the redrawn lines.

It also has immediate ramifications for Congressman-elect Conor Lamb, a Democrat who narrowly won in a special election in Pennsylvanias 18th district last week. Under the new map, this district will cease to exist in its current form and Lamb, as well as his opponent State Rep. Rick Saccone, are reportedly in the process of gathering petitions in new districts. Both of which, are more favorable for their respective parties."
2018-08-05,Daily Beast,Armed Trump Supporters March on Portland Beating Up Opponents and Calling for Hillary Clintons Arr,"PORTLAND, OregonHundreds of armed supporters of President Donald Trump, led by a fringe Republican congressional candidate, marched on Saturday, leaving blood from scattered street fights in their wake.

Ostensibly a campaign event for long-shot U.S. Senate hopeful Joey Gibson, members of his group Patriot Prayer urged the president to lock up his political opponents, including Hillary Clinton, and promised violent retribution for anyone who threatened their right to free speech or armed self-defense. Groups of Trump supporters swarmed through the streets, singling out people of color to fight, some of whom appeared to belong to small vigilante squads of local anti-fascists, as well as others who appeared to be mere passersby. Police announced four arrests, but gave no estimate of injuries.

Extremist group watchdogs such as the Southern Poverty Law Center warned ahead of the event that it could turn into another Charlottesville. It did not, but only in the sense that no one was killed. Such warnings, prompted by Gibsons provocations, put all eyes on the rally.

Only when they antagonize do we react. Stand your ground, Gibson told supporters in a promotional Facebook video. This is a brotherhood, a sisterhood. To bleed together, that's what's important. To bleed together.

His supporters flocked from around the West Coast and the country, a contingent of Proud Boys, ""Three Percenter"" militia members, Trump-supporting bikers, fundamentalist Christians, and college Republicans. Gibson had insinuated that his supporters would bring guns into the city and many apparently did, although to comply with local ordinances, the weapons stayed stowed in backpacks.

Trump-supporting rallygoers will tell you the city suffers from a plague of communists, anarchists, and godless unbelievers, namely because of the large antifa presence.

If someone is gonna attack, Im going to defend my neighbor. Im here to take a bullet for my neighbor, Graeme Whitmeyer, who drove two hours to Portland for the Republican rally, told The Daily Beast.

Whitmeyer said he had heard on Alex Jones Infowars show that antifa was planning an armed assault on the right-wing Patriot Prayer group leading the rally.

This is like a civil war of ideas, he said. This is the cold civil war, right here. This is the epitome of it, in America, right here. I had to jump in and be a part of itbe on the right side of history.

Whitmeyer had come prepared with a handwritten speech about forgiveness. Asked what, if anything, he thought could reconcile his Trump-supporting compatriots with opponents across the street, he replied:

Only the exposing of the crimes of the evil leftists that are brainwashing those crowds over there. The media has twisted them to think that were Nazis. So once the people that are controlling the media are taken down in the courts of law, and arrested or whatever has to be done to them, you knowall of these globalistsyou wont see them [show up].

Its not a reconciliation between sides. They need to wake up, he went on. What they are, are zombies that were created. Minions that were created. Theyre not thinking for themselves.

Nearby, a mostly white group of InfoWars fans surrounded a black Bernie Sanders supporter who had walked alone into the rally and found himself in an on-camera debate. A black Trump supporter told the man he was like the Samuel L. Jackson character in Django Unchained, an Uncle Tom-type plantation servant. Most of the right-wing rallygoers insisted they werent racist.

Amid frenzied chants of ""USA! USA!"" and ""Trump! Trump! Trump!,"" more obscure and ominous slogans could be heard, such as the dubious ""Black Lives MAGA"" and the conspiracy-theory callout: ""No commies, no pedophiles, no child sacrifice!""

Gibson, a former real estate salesman who lost his job after rising to prominence as a pro-Trump street brawler, has a new life as a YouTube and Facebook provocateur. His bodyguard wore a face mask and a t-shirt reading ""Pinochet Did Nothing Wrong"" on the front and on the back, ""Make Communists Afraid of Rotary Aircraft Again,"" with a cartoon of antifa stickmen falling from a helicopter, referencing one notorious tactic of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochets regime.

Gibson raised fears about the event and gained much attention when he changed the location of the August 4 rally to a city park where his supporters could legally carry concealed firearms, provided they carried a permit from the state of Oregon.

Were not here to beat people up, were not here to fight, but you have a God-given right to protect yourself, Gibson said at the rally to cheers. Were gonna put so much pressure on this city, the mayor, the police, the culturethe hateful culturewere going to make history.

One of Gibson's first major rallies in the spring of 2017, a ""free speech"" march in which his supporters carried Trump flags down a street full of immigrant shops and homes, was attended by accused killer Jeremy Christian, a white supremacist. Last year, Christian pulled a knife and stabbed to death two people and injured a third on a light-rail train in Portland. The three victims had stepped in to protect two young black women Christian had been threatening and harassing.

Gibson rejects any association with white supremacists, but they keep showing up to his events, sometimes at his invitation. Lately, he's formed an alliance with the Proud Boys, a ""Western chauvinist"" gang founded by Vice Magazine co-founder Gavin McInnes, who is lately best known for his racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic tirades.

Gibson also has some more mainstream supporters. Earlier this year, Gibson met with former Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone in Oregon. (Stone, like Gibson, is a frequent guest on Alex Jones' Infowars show.) And the chairman of the local GOP has cheered Gibson on during his rise to notoriety, inviting Gibson's associates in the Three Percenter militia to serve as security at party events. Stone this year asked Proud Boys to provide security during his visit to an Oregon conference of Republicans, where he also met with Gibson.

A few blocks from the event, on the barricaded banks of the Willamette River, two brawls between small groups of antifa and Trump supporters broke out on opposite corners of the single downtown intersection within a few minutes.

Greater violence was averted more by luck than careful police work or civic planning. Riot police were concentrated near the vanguard of the counter-protest, located across a major thoroughfare from the pro-Trump rally. As police launched flash-bang grenades and charged at demonstrators, journalists and legal observers on the antifascist side, Gibsons supporters roamed where they wished with minimal attention from authorities.

At one point, a police bicycle patrol arrived somewhat late to a brewing confrontation between a dozen members of Gibsons crew and a smaller antifa group outside a parking garage. As they did elsewhere at the event, police directed their attention toward Gibsons antagonists.

""I'm not sure why you're looking at us,"" a masked antifascist woman scolded the police. She criticized their large-unit motorized tactics, as well. ""You're moving 30 guys, we're moving five, and we've protected several groups. So we've actually been extremely effective today in protecting the people of Portland, where we live, and where they don't live, she said.

""I just go where my sergeant says,"" an officer replied.

Another antifa member, an unmasked, middle-aged black man, took a different approach in appealing to the police rank and file.

""People understand the whole fucking future of our country is at stake right now. We're in a battle for America's soul. We're not playing dress-up,"" he said. I spent 2,923 days in the U.S. Navy protecting our country from motherfuckers like that. If that requires me to shed my own blood, today, I will.

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, has repeatedly said that the city's priority is to protect free speech rights for all, but his police bureau's tactics on Saturday afforded an undisturbed free speech zone for supporters of the president while directing force toward critics of the current administration.

Away from the park, a group of four or five Trump supporters that included a young white man with a bushy red beard wearing a distinctive green costume and toting a shield bearing the logo of Kekistan, the fictional country of 4Chan racists, attacked another group of pedestrians that included two young black men. After an exchange of blows and wrestling match on the concrete and asphalt, blocking traffic, antifa and passersby drove them off.

Moments later a separate contingent of Trump supporters, these wearing green camouflage and militia patches, turned a corner across the street and joined another scuffle with a separate antifa squad.

""Go! Go! Get out of here! Get the fuck out!"" a young man with an antifa tattoo shouted at the men in camo as they slowly retreated. An older white man who had been filming the fracas stood around reviewing the footage on his tablet.

""Which side are you on?"" a masked young white woman leading the ad-hoc antifa squad asked the old man.

""I'm not on any side,"" he replied.

""Oooh, that's the wrong answer,"" she snapped.

The older man quickly reconsidered. ""I'm against that Nazi bullshit,"" he said, gesturing dismissively toward the retreating camo crew. The masked woman seemed satisfied. A middle-aged woman, an antifa medic, next arrived in a hurry.

""We got a report several men were beating a single person. Where is the injured person?"" the medic asked.

""They took off. We called them Nazis, then they swung on us,"" the masked woman said. ""We fuckin' encouraged the Nazis to move away.""

The tattooed antifa man came running back to the group from down the street, where he had been scouting. ""This is fash! This is fash! Forty fascists headed this way!"" he shouted.

A middle-aged, mixed-race couple had fallen in with the younger members of the antifa group. The lady of the couple had seen enough for one day. ""Get over herethis way!"" she scolded her partner. But she quickly relented and tagged along to take pictures.

As quickly as they had appeared, they were gone, and a fresh set of faces passed through intersection near the Downtown Waterfront Marriott hotel. A noisy Jeep full of white teenagers passed by, southbound. ""I love Trump!"" a white teen shouted to anyone and everyone. ""Fuck you, racists! Go home, racists!"" shouted a thirty-something white man wearing a sparkling helmet, as he rolled northbound on a one-wheel motorized skateboard.

Alt-right organizers declared victory as they left the city on decommissioned school buses. And they appeared to be right for two reasons. First, they apparently succeeded in their stated intention of carrying concealed firearms into a city against which Patriot Prayer has repeatedly declared ""war."" Second, they acted with violent impunity in city streets while the police were otherwise occupied playing cat-and-mouse with counter-protesters.

As the street emptied out following another hit-and-run brawl, a used bandage, sopping wet, leaked water and blood onto the sidewalk.

2018-09-14,Daily Beast,Paul Manafort Pleads Guilty Will Cooperate With Special Counsel Mueller,"President Trumps former campaign chief, Paul Manafort, pleaded guilty Friday and agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.

He will also forfeit tens of millions in cash and property, including a Brooklyn brownstone, a Hamptons estateand his 43rd floor apartment in Trump Tower, court documents show.

Wearing a loose-fitting suit, Manafort pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy against the United States and one count of obstruction in connection while admitting to a wide range of illegal behavior detailed in a superseding criminal information.

As part of the deal, he agrees to sit for interviews with Mueller's prosecutors and turn over documents. He won't be sentenced until his cooperation ends, at which point Mueller can decide whether to recommend a lower sentences.

""Its a tough day for Mr. Manafort, but hes accepted responsibility,"" his attorney, Kevin Downing said outside court. ""He wanted to make sure that his family was able to remain safe and live a good life.""

Downing said the plea covered ""conduct that went back many years,"" and the White House also seized on the fact that Manafort has not been charged with any crimes linked to election meddling.

""This had absolutely nothing to do with the president or his victorious 2016 presidential campaign,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. ""It is totally unrelated.""

Trump has expressed sympathy for Manafort as he's fought charges brought by Mueller for a year. It's not clear how Manafort's decision to flip could affect any chance of winning a pardon from the president.

Manafort worked for the campaign for five months and attended a Trump Tower meeting with Russians that has drawn Mueller's scrutiny. He and his business partner, Rick Gates, were indicted in May 17.

Gates copped a plea and testified against Mueller at a federal fraud trial in Alexandria, Virginia, where the jury convicted him of eight counts but deadlocked on 10 other counts. Prosecutors agreed to dismiss those 10 counts as part of the deal.

He is the sixth person to cut a deal with Mueller, who previously secured guilty pleas from Gates, former Trump National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, former campaign aide George Papadopoulos, and Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan. In addition, Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty in a Manhattan case that grew out of a referral from Mueller's probe.

None of them faced charges directly related to Mueller's main mission: investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. But Mueller has also gotten indictments against two dozen Russian nationals and entities, including intelligence officers, for meddling in the election. A man who sold bank account numbers to the Russians also pleaded guilty.

ABC News reported on Sept. 12 that Manaforts attorneys had been discussing a potential deal with Muellers team for several weeks. Sources told ABC that Mueller wanted Manafort to share information about Trump as part of a cooperation agreement but Manafort didnt want to make such a deal.

Rudy Giuliani, the presidents personal lawyer, told Politico that the possibility of a deal didnt concern him.

Theres no fear that Paul Manafort would cooperate against the president because theres nothing to cooperate about and we long ago evaluated him as an honorable man, he said.

Giuliani also told Politico that Trump and Manaforts attorneys have been sharing information throughout the investigation through a joint defense agreement.

After working for a host of Republican politicians, Manafort lobbied for a host of foreign authoritarians and strongmen, including Ferdinand Marcos, Mobutu Sese Seko, Sani Abacha, and Jonas Savimbi. Those men have drawn criticism from human rights watchdogs for a host of bad actions, including embezzling billions of dollars, torturing people in prison, and recruiting child soldiers.

Manaforts work for Viktor Yanukovych, the Russia-friendly former president of Ukraine, has drawn Muellers attention. Muellers prosecutors allege that Manafort illegally lobbied in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych and his political party. The charges sent shockwaves through Washingtons clubby lobbying community, where many influence-dealers are unaccustomed to muscular federal enforcement of lobbying laws."
2018-07-03,Daily Beast,Armed Cops Forced Domestic-Violence Victims to Make Naked Catfight Sex Videos Lawsuit Claims,"I like strong women, former Horry County Police Officer Troy Allen Large said in a March 2016 deposition. Thats my dark secret.

But Large, who died earlier this year, had more than just one dark secret during his 27-year tenure at the South Carolina police department.

Large was indicted in September 2016 by a Horry County Grand Jury on 11 counts of misconduct in office and criminal sexual conduct in the third degree for allegedly committing sexual battery against multiple victims and engaging in inappropriate relationships with victims of crimes he was actively investigating.

Large, a former sex-crimes investigator, is accused of using his position of power to form inappropriate relationships with female victims of violent crime and then either sexually assaulting them or coercing them into participating in video-recorded, nude catfights, according to a new motion filed last week in U.S. District Court in South Carolina.

The 30-page motion claims police officials were aware of the accusations against its officersand that the department failed to address it.

The motion stems from one of several lawsuits filed by female victims of Large against the late Large, Horry County, the Horry County Police Department, the countys ex-Police Chief Saundra Rhodes, former Deputy Chief Scott Rutherford, and ex-officers Chip Squires and Dale Buchanan.

During that five-hour March 2016 deposition, according to ABC 15 News, Large denied he ever made sexual advances toward the women involved in his nude catfight videos and claimed he never actually recorded the fights himself. He did, however, concede that he encouraged the women to participate.

I like watching the videos of women engaged boxing, MMA, catfight, wrestling, he said.

Theres businesses, he said, referring to companies that professionally film such catfights. Its not illegal. Some people like it. Its a fetish. Its embarrassing. I dont know why. I think its neat. I like Rhonda Rousey. I like that.

Large was assigned to investigate Rachels domestic assault in March 1998, after her then-husband shot her five timesonce in the hip and four times through the hand. After she remarried, Rachels new husband threatened her and other members of her family with a firearm in 2015. Large was, once again, assigned to investigate the case. Instead, Large engaged in a pattern of sexual abuse and coercive behavior, according to the court documents.

Between January 2015 and December 2015, Large assaulted Rachel more than 50 times, her motion claims. During that same time period, he began coercing her into participating in a nude, sexual fetish catfight video with another female victim of domestic abuse inside the home of another law enforcement officer in Asheville, North Carolina, her lawsuit claims.

Large held the camera, according to the lawsuit.

Rachel felt incapable of leaving due to the presence of armed law enforcement officers at this fight, according to the motion. Cellphone footage later allegedly showed that Large engaged in inappropriate contact with Rachel while he was working.

Rachel dismissed her lawsuit against Large after his death, but has maintained her complaints against the city and police department.

On Christmas Eve in 2013, Erin reported to police that she was held at gunpoint and forced to perform oral sex on her assailant. Three days later, Detective Large contacted her, ostensibly to investigate her case. Over the next six months, the detective engaged in a course of coercive behavior, unwanted sexual advances, and sexual assault toward her.

Large closed Erins initial cases as unfounded, but he did not stop the alleged misconduct.

On one occasion, Large allegedly assaulted Erin on the way home from a court hearing. On another, he attacked her on the front porch of her own home. Erin has said, according to the motion submitted last month, that Large displayed his police badge and police-issued firearm during these attacks.

Alyssa called the Horry County Police Department on May 19, 2015, after she was kidnapped and raped, according to the motion. Detective Large was assigned to her case but almost immediatelyinstead of investigating the crimeoffered to pay Alyssa to perform oral sex or to let him watch her fight other women. Large allegedly told Alyssa that he wanted to watch her perform oral sex on other law-enforcement officers. He eventually coerced her into performing a sex act, according to the motion.

Emma was just 20 and suffering from heroin addiction when she was contacted by the detective, according to the motion. Large quickly made it clear that he had accessed the police database and discussed her prior arrests and reported history of childhood sexual abuse which had been previously investigated by the Horry County Police Department, according to the motion.

Large allegedly appeared at Emmas home the next day, entered her bedroom, put his firearm next to her heroin needles, and forced her to submit to sex acts.

In the months that followed, Detective Large regularly contacted [Emma] about participating in fights with other women; touched her inappropriately on multiple occasions; and took her to purchase heroin which she carried in his police vehicle, according to the motion.

Eventually, Emmas mother called the department and spoke with one of the detectives supervisors. She allegedly told officials that the detective had been picking up her daughter and bringing her home high on drugs.

The city, and the police departments leaders, all named as defendants in the suit, allegedly had actual and constructive knowledge of Detective Larges unconstitutional behavior stemming back as far as 2003, yet took no appropriate action.

According to the motion, Larges father-in-law sent a letter to the departments internal affairs investigators claiming that the now-deceased detective had an unlimited supply of county vehicles, which he was using to stalk female victims.

The facts and evidence show that the individual defendants, according to the motion, who all served as supervisors of Detective Large, had actual notice of Detective Larges propensity to abuse his position of power; actual knowledge of Detective Large having previously used this position of power to form unconstitutional sexual relationships with female victims of crime; and specific knowledge of Detective Larges unconstitutional, sexualized contact with Plaintiff Jane Doe-3, yet took no action to stop it, amounting to tacit authorization of the acts.

Eventually, the motion argues, there was widespread knowledge throughout the department, particularly with detective Larges supervisors, that [he] was exhibiting predatory behavior toward female victims of crime.

Large was fired in July 2015, but the problem wasnt specific to one detective.

Three other former officers were indicted on charges, including misconduct in office, for failing to properly investigate alleged crimes. All three pleaded not guilty.

Between Jan. 1, 2006, and Sept. 26, 2016, 13 independent internal investigationsexcluding the ones involving the catfight fanwere ordered to probe reports of sexual misconduct by Horry County police officers against members of the public, according to the motion.

According to the motion, some officers in those investigations that were suspected of misconduct were allowed to resign in lieu of termination and transfer to other police departments without a record of the misdeeds.

Large died of natural causes on Jan. 10, 2018, at the age of 55. He was under house arrest at the time of his death.

The county has refused to comment on the case to local reporters, citing pending litigation.

2018-11-21,Daily Beast,I Helped Lead the Fire Pelosi Campaign in 2018 Democrats Would Be Nuts to Do It Now,"In 2010, I helped lead the effort of the Republican National Committees Fire Pelosi campaign, launched the evening of the House vote on Obamacare that then-Speaker Pelosi pushed through with a one-vote margin. The campaign exceeded our expectations; we surpassed our fundraising goals by more than 400 percent, a much needed boost for a committee struggling to raise money, and led to the Fire Pelosi bus tour, a centerpiece for 117 successful political events in the 48 continental states.

Our campaign, however, rested on one key premise: Nancy Pelosi, we believed, had to go precisely because she was so effective. Had Speaker Pelosi not been able to get Obamacare through, our campaign had no rationale.

Had Democrats dumped Pelosi following the 2010 elections, that would have made sense: our efforts helped make Pelosi the face of a staggering 63-seat loss in the House. So surprised were we that Democrats did not throw her overboard following their loss of the House, that we altered our Fire Pelosi sign to read Hire Pelosi.

But this is a different world, politically, than eight years ago. Nancy Pelosi was again a key driver in this election, the top fundraiser for Democrats as they retook the House in an election that just so happens to have had a massive increase in both female voters and female candidates.

Democrats stayed with Pelosi for eight years, even as Republicans made an issue of her in congressional races across the country again this year. And while it is understandable why Republicans want to campaign and vote against Pelosishe is a bankable commodity for the GOPexactly why are are Democrats talking about dumping the most powerful woman in American political history, one with a successful track record of moving Democratic policy goals through the House, just after after she helped them reclaim the majority there?!

As Team Pelosi works to secure a majority and ensure there are no surprises on the House floor during the January speakership vote, there has been talk that she should announce she will serve only a single term as an essentially transitional speaker this time. Announcing such a move, however, would immediately mark her as a lame duck and kick off a two year campaign for the next Speakership.

Meanwhile the Never Nancy letter signed by a small group of House Democrats consists overwhelmingly of (a) members in safe seats and (b) men. This is not the look, politically, you want after some Democrats in tough seats maintained that they would not support Pelosi, and others have flipped, potentially causing further problems back in their Congressional districts. More, the letter fails to list any specifics for why they feel Pelosi should go, other than the need for change.

This suggests that, as of now, the votes to block Pelosi are not there even as Democrats , i n a caucus eager for younger and more diverse leaders after a generation of waiting that led some potential leaders to leave the House , are running short on patience. This would be a strange moment, however, to lose the last of that patience.

Democrats have much to celebrate even as victories bring new challenges and questions. What happens to Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic leadership is a first test, but one that could determine on day one the course of the Democratic majority."
2018-03-01,Daily Beast,Stephen Colbert Warns NRA Trump Is Coming for Your Guns,"NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch isnt the only one who was blindsided by President Donald Trumps comments on guns today.

I have no explanation for what happened this afternoon, Stephen Colbert said of Trumps meeting with lawmakers about potential gun legislation on Wednesday. We need to find any solution that does not involve an imaginary Donald Trump stopping an attack with karate, he joked.

But it was Trumps comments about the NRA that really baffled the Late Show host. They have great power over you people, the president told Republicans in the room. They have less power over me. What do I need?

Uh, a conscience, a shred of dignity and Im gonna say like a salad once in a while, Colbert answered.

Later, Trump told GOP members that if they try to add concealed carry reciprocity to a comprehensive gun bill, they will never get it passed. That line stopped Colbert cold. Hes being... reasonable? he asked in disbelief.

Ive gotta give credit to Donald Trump, Colbert said. I never thought hed go there. But not only did he go there, he went way past thereto a place no one had a ticket for!

Colbert was talking about the line from Trump that got the most attention this afternoon. I like taking the guns early. Like in this crazy mans case that just took place in Florida, the president said. To go to court would have taken a long time. So you could do exactly what youre saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.

Well, hes finally doing something Obama never did, Colbert said. Hes coming for your guns."
2018-03-27,Daily Beast,Neo-Confederate League of the South Banned From Protesting in Charlottesville,"One of the white-supremacist groups behind the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia has been banned from hosting protests in the city.

The League of the South, a Confederacy-worshipping hate group, is not welcome back in Charlottesville, after they agreed to a deal with the city on Monday, the Southern Poverty Law Center first reported.

The deal stems from a lawsuit by Georgetown Laws Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection accusing the League and other Unite the Right participants of engaging in violent protests that escalated until a man connected with white-supremacist groups rammed a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a 32-year-old woman.

Now the League is barred from demonstrating in the city again. And the ongoing lawsuit means more white-supremacist groups might sign similar deals.

The League of the South is a pro-Confederate group with a paramilitary wing and leaders with far-reaching extremist ties. Michael Tubbs, chairman of the groups Florida chapter, pleaded guilty in 1991 to armed robbery of machine guns from a U.S. Army base while he was a soldier in the 1980s. Victims told investigators that Tubbs and his co-conspirators planned to give the weapons to the Ku Klux Klan, and that stealing weapons was the only way that the organization could survive.

A raid on Tubbs home prior to his 1991 arrest revealed explosives, guns, VHS tapes of Hitler, racist literature, and his handwritten notes detailing what appeared to be planned attacks on Jewish- and African-American-owned businesses and news outlets.

Tubbs and Spencer Borum, the Leagues Kentucky chairman, are named extensively in the Georgetown lawsuit, which details how white-supremacist groups allegedly coordinated attacks on counter-protesters.

Later-arriving groups simply bulldozed anyone who slowed down their entry, the suit describes.

Defendant League of the South epitomized this technique by plowing through a line of counter-protestors. Defendant Spencer Borum, Chairman of the Leagues Kentucky chapter, triggered a violent melee by charging at counter-protestors with his flagpole. Nearly a dozen League members rushed in from behind, ramming into the crowd with their matching shields held in formation.

The neo-Nazi group the Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP) followed the League into the crowd, according to the lawsuit, which includes quotes from the partys then-spokesman Matthew Parrott praising the League attack.

With a full-throated rebel yell, the League broke through the wall of degenerates, Parrott told the Los Angeles Times after the Unite the Right rally. The quotes are included in the lawsuit. Michael Tubbs, an especially imposing League organizer[,] towered over and pushed through the antifa like a Tyrannosaurus.

The lawsuit describes the TWP allegedly working with the League to push down counter-protesters with with shields.

Moments later, League members shoved a counter-protestor to the pavement, screamed Leave! and Get the fuck out of here!, spat in her face, and pepper-sprayed her at point-blank range, the suit alleges.

At another point, Tubbs instructed his followers to use flagpoles like javelins against counter-protesters, the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit also seeks to bar other Unite the Right participants including the TWP, Vanguard America, and the National Socialist Movement from hosting future demonstrations in Charlottesville. Unite the Right organizer Jason Kessler and anti-fascist group Redneck Revolt are also named in the suit, although only the League has signed an agreement to steer clear of the city."
2018-07-28,Daily Beast,Wanna Save Roe v Wade Dont Look To The Courts,"With the political balance of the Supreme Court now in the hands of anti-choice conservatives, reproductive rights advocates across the United States are bracing for a future without Roe v. Wade . But what if there were another way to protect abortion rights, this time in the Constitution?

Roe v. Wade , the judicial cornerstone of abortion rights, was not decided as a grand gesture towards womens equal rights. In fact, the decision was based largely on the right to privacy, and the rights of doctors to treat patients as they saw fit.

Both the basis of the privacy argument and even the technical, technological underpinnings of [Roe] always seemed likely to expire, said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, Women and Democracy Fellow at NYUs Brennan Center for Justice. Technology was always going to move us to a place where the trimester framework didnt make sense.

If you were rooted in an equality argument, those things would not matter, she said.

The Equal Rights Amendment, which would prohibit sex discrimination the way the Constitution currently prohibits discrimination based on race, religion and national origin, could do just that. The ERA would provide the framework for an equality argument: Womens equality necessarily requires reproductive and bodily autonomy, and without control over our bodies, women cannot participate as full and equal citizens in this country.

After decades of political dormancy, the ERA has recently come back into play. The amendment, which was passed by Congress in 1972, stalled after proponents were only able to get 35 of the required 38 states to ratify it by a 1982 deadline. The effort picked up steam in the 1990s, when a plausible argument emerged that the deadline wasnt constitutionally mandated and could therefore be changed. Since then, Nevada and Illinois have ratified the ERA. (There are some hurdles: Once a 38th state ratifies the amendment, we can expect contentious legal battles over whether the deadline can be moved, and whether the five states that have rescinded their ratification were actually allowed to do so.)

The text of the ERA itself doesnt itself mention abortion. It reads, Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. A right to abortion based on an Equal Rights Amendment wouldnt be about the abortion procedure itself. It would be about womens ability to live equally as full citizens under the law.

Several state equal rights amendments have already interpreted this way, and could point the way forward. In 1986, the Connecticut Superior Court struck down an abortion restriction using states ERA, ruling that discrimination against pregnancy by not funding abortion when it is medically necessary and when all other medical expenses are paid by the state for both men and women is sex oriented discrimination. In 1998, New Mexicos high court ruled that a policy to restrict funding for medically necessary abortions violated New Mexico's Equal Rights Amendment because it result[ed] in a program that does not apply the same standard of medical necessity to both men and women.

To be sure, a conservative Supreme Court thats willing to strike down Roe v. Wade isnt necessarily going to interpret the ERA as mandating abortion specifically. But the second article of the ERA grants Congress the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and legislation written specifically to protect abortion rights on the grounds that they enforce the equal protection guaranteed by the ERA might stand a better chance.

In many other countries, abortion rights have come not through the judiciary but through the legislature, said Julie C. Suk, a professor at Cardozo Law who teaches constitutional and equality law. If the people who are really advocating for reproductive rights in America realize they can't trust the judiciary to protect those reproductive rights, then they have to create a legislative politics around reproductive rights, which I think is feasible.

 You could get a very conservative judge who is willing to say, the Constitution does not protect a womans right to choose explicitly, said Suk. It would take a special kind of extra anti-abortion zeal for that same judge to say, if the legislature passes legislation protecting abortion rights, thats unconstitutional.

Suk believes the legislative history of the ERA has always included reproductive rights, but that we can make it more clearly include reproductive rights by being as loud as possible.

But thats exactly the opposite of what has happened.

ERA advocate are torn between conflicting strategies. They can assert that the ERA has nothing to do with abortion in order to win over skeptical conservative legislators now -- but thereby setting themselves up for contradiction if and when the ERA is later needed to preserve abortion rights. As Cardozo Law professor Julie Suk put it, If you get your victory by not bringing in the divisive issues, it's not as big a victory.

Alternatively, advocates can assert those abortion rights now, galvanizing the support of young women who fear a post-Roe future but potentially firing up the conservative critics that could block ratification.

""I think whether or not judges have an obligation to read abortion rights into an ERA that may pass really depends on how loud we are as those who advocate and help get the ERA ratified today, said Suk.

Theres a case to be made that loud, abortion-based ERA advocacy could speak to the multitudes of women fired up by Trumps presidency, the threats to Roe v. Wade, and the resurgence of the #metoo movement. Many abortion advocates have already distanced themselves from Hillary Clintons refrains of keeping abortion safe, legal, and rare, arguing instead that abortion can in fact be a positive thing in a womans reproductive life. The #shoutyourabortion social media campaign, launched by activists in 2015, has encouraged women to speak about their abortions openly and without shame.

In the meantime, ERA advocates have their sights set on Virginia and North Carolina, the two states that have been deemed most likely to ratify the ERA in the near future.

The ERA-North Carolina Alliance, a group of advocacy organizations, is pushing state legislators and midterm legislative candidates to declare their support for the ERA. Their goal is to achieve critical mass by the next legislative session in 2019.

We havent really figure out what our plans are should Roe be overturned, said Audrey Muck, vice president of communications for the alliance. But at the moment, with Roe being the law of the land, we can focus on what the ERA says, which is strictly about equal rights for men and women under the Constitution.

During the fight for ratification in the 1970s, the pro-ERA campaign was plagued by infighting over whether to prioritize abortion. ERA advocates consciously left ambiguous the amendments potential implications for a womans right to choose.

People said the ERA will be like a super-Roe and thats the reason it had to be defeated, explained Amy Myrick a lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights who studied the ERA for her sociology PhD (who stressed that she was not speaking on behalf of the Center). That partly feeds into reluctance to say that the ERA is going to do all these things when we know that theyre divisive. Rhetorically, that might not help its chances.

Anti-ERA advocates have always argued that the amendment would lead to fully legalized abortion. Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative leader often credited with derailing the ERAs political momentum in the 1970s, railed against the amendment by insisting it would legalize abortion on demand, force women to serve in the military, and validate same-sex marriages.

Several advocates and scholars told me that the old strategy is still in play. Some said off the record that they dont want to lend credence to the conservative rights attack, and are therefore focusing their ERA messaging on other, more palatable equality issues like equal pay and pregnancy discrimination. In a way, theyre keeping mum on abortion so as not to tip their hands.

When I asked them about what the ERA could do for reproductive rights, other advocates simply demurred. We are not focused on that issue right now, Carol Robles-Roman, Co-President and CEO of the ERA Coalition, told me via email. She declined to say why. A representative for NARAL Pro Choice America declined to comment on whether or how the organization is thinking about the ERAs impact on reproductive rights.

Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), who is leading the effort in Congress to revitalize the ERA, said she believes reproductive rights are integral to womens equality. But, she added, I think that the ERA is about more than just reproductive rights and that womens equality is about more than just our bodies. I would not want to limit the way people look at the ERA by tying it too closely to any one issue.

I understand the hangups and concerns of leading with abortion rights, said Weiss-Wolf. It feels like youre walking into Phyllis Schlafly's trap.

In November, Weiss-Wolf and the Brennan Center will hold a day-long convening of academics, advocates and experts to discuss the future of the ERA. The ultimate goal, she said is to look at [the ERA] in a broader way so that its not just igniting the abortion wars. Rather than leading with abortion specifically, advocates might call for a reproductive justice framework that includes economic and civic equality, she said.

I think that we all have to accept the fact that there are going to be multiple strategies were going to have to advance at the same time, Weiss-Wolf added. With regard to abortion rights, the demise of Roe seems imminent, and I think that were going to have to be multifaceted.

Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, questioned the effectiveness of leaving abortion off the discussion table. I dont think we should remain silent because maybe theyll use it against us, she said. Are you kidding? They do use it against us, every chance they have.

Van Pelt said the ERA is hugely important for reproductive rights, for birth control, for abortion, for the right not to be sterilized, to have autonomy and be treated as the adults we are."
2018-09-30,Daily Beast,Kanye West Rocks Trump MAGA Hat to Close Out SNL Premiere,"Days before he took the stage as the first musical guest of Saturday Night Lives 44th season, Kanye West popped up in promos for the show wearing his red Make America Great Again hat. The official Trump paraphernalia didnt feature into his first two performances as musical guest Saturday night, nor did viewers get what could have been an alternatively hilarious or deeply awkward sketch in which he could come face-to-face with Alec Baldwins Trump.

But when West, who officially changed his name to Ye on Twitter earlier in the day, came out for the goodnights, the hat was back. After host Adam Driver and the rest of the cast left the stage, West was joined by Kid Cudi and 070 Shake for a rare third performance to close the show.

They performed Ghost Town from his recent album, also called Ye, and notably West took the verse that usually belongs to PartyNextDoor and includes the line, Some days, not gonna please everybody. As he rapped the line, This aint what they had in mind, he pointed directly to those four words on his red hat.

Were still the kids we used to be, all three sang in unison near the end of the song, but it was hard not to miss how far hes come from his hallowed performance of Runaway in an Eddie Murphy-esque red leather suit, surrounded by ballet dancers in tutus on SNL just eight years ago."
2018-07-14,Daily Beast,Viral Video Gives Chilling Glimpse into the Rights Anti-Trans Campaign,"An anti-transgender video titled Pediatrician Shuts Down Leftists on Puberty Blockers has gone viral on Facebook, with over 58 million views to date. It gives a chilling glimpse into the Rights new campaign against transgender people: that transgender people simply do not exist. (It may also be triggering for some readers, which I write as a caution before clicking on the link.)

In the video, Dr. Michelle Cretella of the American College of Pediatricians (ACP) spends five minutes discussing how sex is a biological, genetic fact, and that any attempt to change it is, when it comes to teenagers, a form of child abuse.

There are five crucial errors in the video, but its presence and impact should be of great concern to LGBT people and their allies.

Its misleading name notwithstanding, the ACP is not a professional organization, but an anti-LGBT conservative advocacy group that has around 200 members.

In contrast, there are over 60,000 members of the mainstream American Academy of Pediatricians, which officially stands in support of transgender children and adults, and condemns attempts to stigmatize or marginalize them and has created a detailed guide for caring for trans children.

ACP was founded in 2002 to oppose gay adoption. Since that time, it has taken extreme positions on abortion (life begins at conception; abortion is murder), capital punishment (contrary to all peer-reviewed studies, ACP says it is beneficial), abstinence-only sex education (again, debunked by all scientific studies), reparative therapy for gay people (same), and now transgender people.

In other words, while presenting itself as a scientific organization, it is an anti-scientific organization.

ACP has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center because of its repeated lies and campaigns against LGBT people. Cretella herself is executive director of ACP, and apparently its sole staff member.

Gender is not the same as sex

The video conflates sex, which is a biological fact (usually) determined by genetics and anatomy, and gender, which is a socially constructed set of notions of what it is to be a man, a women, or neither. As the quip goes, sex is between your legs, but gender is between your ears.

To take a religious example, when the Bible talks about women giving birth, thats sex. When it says Wives, submit to your husbands as you do the Lord, (Eph. 5:22) thats gender. When the Bible talks about men usually having deeper voices and hairier bodies, thats sex. When the Bible talks about men inheriting property and owning their wives, thats gender. See the difference?

The video completely misstates this. It describes identity as something which is factually right or factually wrong. But thats only true if identity is about sex. In fact, transgender identity is about gender.

Not only that  the video doesnt even mention gender. It fails to define or even acknowledge the primary subject it is supposedly about.

You might notice that the video doesnt feature any trans people speaking about their experiences. Thats because if it did, those experiences would be very different from what Dr. Cretella says they are. She describes gender dysphoria as simply thinking or feeling oneself to be of the other gender, and then strolling into a doctors office to say so.

That is not what gender dysphoria is or how it is diagnosed. As described in the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual for mental health, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria requires a persistent gender identity (not some occasional whim), symptoms that last for at least six months, severe discomfort in ones body, a pattern of behavior, and other factors.

As the DSM-5 specifies, but as the video ignores, gender dysphoria is far more than gender nonconformity  boys playing with dolls or girls playing with power tools  and is a diagnosable, treatable medical condition.

The video also says nothing about the rates of wellness and illness before and after transition  absurdly suggesting that parents are bluntly warned their children will commit suicide if they dont transition. In fact, numerous peer-reviewed studies show marked increases in mental health outcomes once gender dysphoria is addressed.

Being transgender is not a mental illness

The video describes being transgender as actually being mentally ill. One wonders: has Dr. Cretella ever met a transgender person? My dozen or so trans friends are clearly not mentally ill. Trans celebrities like Laverne Cox and Janet Mock are clearly not mentally ill. What planet is Dr. Cretella living on?

To somehow justify this view, the video seizes on one case study  not documented, so I dont even know if it actually happened  of one kid. This is anecdote, not science. For every one Andy in the video, there are dozens of actual trans kids who have had gender dysphoria addressed and had clusters of mental health conditions like mood disorders and suicidal ideation vanish.

One peer-reviewed study in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry followed 179 transgender children and 185 controls, for example.

And there are numerous such studies. An analysis in Psychology Today noted in the journal Pediatrics in 2014, researchers showed that pubertal blockade and cross-sex hormones resulted in improved mental health for transgender youth.

""In 2016 and 2017, two papers showed that transgender children who are supported in their identities and allowed to socially transition have developmentally normal rates of anxiety, depression, and self-worth. Furthermore, transgender individuals whose families do not support their transgender identities are 20 percent more likely to attempt suicide.

This is the danger of using a single anecdote and ignoring the scientific method: the results are extremely misleading and over-generalizable. Of course, in the videos case, the danger is entirely on purpose.

The only way any of this video can be true is if everything the scientific community tells us is wrong.

Thats why the video attacks the vague, shadowy experts, in what is basically a Trumpist conspiracy theory. As in other populist fantasies, the elites/experts/media/establishment have all either lost their minds or are actively, conspiratorially destroying our society and putting kids in danger.

Not coincidentally, all these experts and elites are the same people: over-educated urbanites, the enemies of the people. This is populist demagoguery, sometimes directed at Jews (Hollywood elites, New York bankers), sometimes just at latte-sipping intellectuals driving our Priuses in Park Slope (I do all of these things). One doesnt have to invoke Germany of the 1930s to see how dangerous this thinking is.

Science is real. The scientific method is real. The science on transgender is part of that. If you dont believe in transgender, you shouldnt believe in your microwave oven or cellular phone, because all are products of the same scientific method.

So, the video is wrong, and this matters hugely.

First, the federal government has already eliminated many references to transgender people as such, affecting schools, VA hospitals, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and much more.

If the government redefines transgender as a mental illness and allocates money to ""treat"" it with therapy and perhaps other interventions (shock treatment, maybe?), this could lead to widespread abuses of transgender people that look a lot like the 1950s when gay men and lesbians were subjected to shock treatment, institutionalization, and anti-psychotic drugs to cure something that cannot and need not be cured.

Second, the issue of trans kids is a wedge. As a parent, I get that its scary to think that experts will cause your daughter to have a double mastectomy, even against your own wishes. But this is a pure scare tactic, not how treating gender dysphoria actually works in practice  and also as a parent, I find that particularly outrageous, hitting parents at their weak spots.

Its a deplorable tactic that encourages emotional, reactive responses rather than reasoned ones  and yet, based on past experiences, it might just work to lessen support for trans people. (Its also a wedge meant to sever the T from LGBT, but so far, this tactic has failed spectacularly with LGBT communities refusing to be torn apart.)

Finally, and speaking to LGBT allies here primarily, progressives need to see that the sticks are being moved here. Were not talking about bathrooms or pronouns or employment protections anymore. Were being forced to debate whether trans people even exist.  This is basic stuff, folks, and the consequences of failure are severe, as they were for gay people half a century ago.

Im not one who sees the sky falling on gay people, even if the federal marriage right is overturned by the Supreme Court (which is quite likely). But on trans people? The sky has never not been falling, and these storm clouds are dark and ominous.

Moreover, this junk science is being mainstreamed. The Heritage Foundation published a video with nearly the same title as the viral one: Pediatrician Shuts Down Leftists on Giving Children Puberty Blockers. This the same Heritage Foundation that has provided much of the Trump administrations staffing.

If there is a silver lining here, its that government is not the only place where societal values are enacted. Culture is another one, and here, from Caitlyn Jenner to the film Tangerine to the FX series Pose, culture is moving forward even if our Christian Right dominated government is moving backward.

If anything, the Republican partys shocking retrenchment on transgender existence ought to be a political liability for them, as a generation entirely comfortable with trans people recoils against transphobia, trans-ignorance, and anti-trans violence.

The truth does matter, and you can hide from it only by living in a Fox News bubble and never changing the channel.

But as soon as you open your eyes and talk to someone trans in your community, or listen to trans people in the media, those lies fall apart. In reality, the science on transgender is real and transgender people is real  and while videos like this one can go viral today, one day we will marvel at how anyone could have believed this crap."
2018-04-12,Daily Beast,Landlord Raped Harassed Tenants at 50 New York Properties Justice Department Says,"A picturesque little town on the shores of Lake Ontario has for decades served as the horrific playground on which one landlordwho owned and managed at least 50 propertiesharassed, raped, and otherwise demeaned female tenants, a new Justice Department lawsuit claims.

On a spring day in Oswego, New York, a teenager went to look at an apartment, where Douglas Waterbury allegedly locked her in a rental unit, lifted her skirt, pushed her onto a couch, and raped her, according to the court documents.

The teen, who was allegedly attacked in May 2017, was apparently not alone. Waterbury groped and raped numerous women, intruded into their homes, and offered rent credit in exchange for sex, according to the complaint filed by the department Wednesday.

In fact, the filing describes decades of egregious harassment by Waterbury beginning as early as 1990. Waterbury, his wife, Carol, and residential-property companies E&A Management Co. and Ontario Realty are named as defendants. The complaint claims they all violated the Fair Housing Act, which is intended to prohibit discrimination.

Six low-income tenants of Waterburys filed claims against him last year .

The Justice Department claims Waterbury subjected prospective tenants and residents of his properties to severe, pervasive, and unwelcome sexual harassment. He allegedly pressured and forced numerous women to have sexual intercourse, oral sex, and other acts in order to obtain or keep rental housing.

In 2016, the landlord allegedly demanded one woman trade sex for housing benefits.

Although the woman was in desperate need of housing and eventually became homeless, she continued to refuse, the complaint alleges.

That same year, Waterbury threatened to evict a woman if she did not have sex with him, according to the lawsuit. She rejected all of his advances and ultimately moved out of the house because of his relentless harassment and threats, the lawsuit claims.

Those stories, according to the complaint, are just examples of Waterburys longstanding pattern and practice of harassment and assault, which caused prospective and actual tenants alike to suffer physical harm, fear, anxiety, and emotional distress, according to the suit.

Subjecting tenants and those looking for housing to harassment and demands for sex is unacceptable, said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore, of the Civil Rights Division, in a statement.

Grant C. Jaquith, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, added, Housing cannot be conditioned on submission to sexual harassment.

The lawsuit seeks civil penalties, monetary damages to compensate the victims, and a court order barring future discrimination.

Waterbury reportedly did not respond to multiple attempts to contact him by local media."
2018-07-11,Daily Beast,Meghan Markle Wades Into Irish Abortion Debate,"DUBLINMeghan Markle has been drawn into a political row after expressing opinions about the Irish abortion referendum on her royal tour of the country.

An Irish politician said in a tweet that Markle told her she was pleased with the result of the recent referendum to legalize abortion, while a well-known Yes campaigner and feminist journalist also tweeted that she had chatted to Markle about the campaign to repeal the 8th Amendment of the Irish constitution which forbade abortion, and strongly implied that Meghan agreed with her pro-choice views.

Catherine Noone, a senator for the the ruling Fine Gael party who was closely associated with the successful Yes campaign, also said she spoke to Meghan at the garden party held last night at the British ambassadors residence in Dublin on Tuesday, where Harry and Meghan are on their first foreign tour as a married couple.

The senator tweeted: The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum resultshe watched with interest and was pleased to see the result.

However, apparently quickly realizing her blunderunder the constitutional monarchy structure, royals have been prohibited since the 17th Century from expressing political opinionsshe followed up with a second tweet that sought to backpedal on the claim, saying: I should say she seemed pleasedshe was interested and very measured, not political at all.

While 'seeming' pleased is better than saying 'I'm pleased', neither are part of the great royal tradition of impartiality.

Mulally has left her tweet untouched although both of Noone's tweets were subsequently deleted, and instead Noone posted a more anodyne remark, reading, A pleasure to meet Prince Harry & the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassadors Residence this evening. #harryandmeghan #royalcouple #meghanmarkle.

Noone said she had deleted her original message as it was misleading, telling the Irish Times: The Duchess was interested and charming and was not in any way political.

The revelation that Markle did, albeit unwittingly, express an opinion on such a controversial and political issue as the abortion rules of a foreign sovereign country is a major blunder.

As a member of the royal family, the Duchess of Sussex is clearly prohibited from speaking publicly about politics and once again questions will be asked about whether the team advising her have done enough to prepare her for her public role.

Her team have been widely criticized for failing to control Meghan's dad, Thomas Markle, who ruined the carefully choreographed run-up to the royal wedding with a series of interviews with TMZ and then gave a paid interview to a British TV breakfast show. He fears he has now been permanently cut off by his daughter.

Irelands draconian abortion laws are due to be changed shortly after the country voted by a margin of 66/34 to overturn the ban. Abortion will now be permitted in all circumstances up to 12 weeks of gestation.

However the issue is still deeply divisive and, while there will be little surprise that Meghan is pro-choice, it is deeply unfortunate that she can now be seen to have taken a position on the question.

Ireland became a lightning rod for foreign pro-life campaigners who descended on the city and flooded the country with online advertising during the campaign, until Facebook and Google banned the ads."
2018-09-09,Daily Beast,CBS Les Moonves Is Stepping Down Immediately Will Donate 20M of Severance to MeToo,"Leslie Moonves, a titan of TV over the past two decades, stepped down as chief executive at CBS on Sunday night, hours after a new round of women stepped forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct.

In a statement released shortly after 7 p.m., the CBS board of directors announced that the 68-year-old Moonveswho denies allegations of forcing himself on womenwill immediately depart from his duties as chairman, president, and chief executive officer at the company he has led for 15 years.

The announcement came hours after The New Yorker published sexual misconduct allegations from six additional women that include physical violence, intimidation and forced oral sex.

As part of his settlement to leave the company, Moonves will donate $20 million of his severance package to one or more organizations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace, the company said. The payment will be made immediately and deducted from any severance benefits due to Moonves, the board said.

Moonves will not receive any severance payment until an independent investigation into the allegations is complete, other than compensation and benefits that he has accrued and vested, the board said.

As part of the agreement, the company announced that six members of the board were replaced with new directors, including three women, and that Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello will serve as president and acting CEO while the board conducts a search for a permanent successor.

The prospect of a golden parachute for Moonves, a severance that some reports has put around $100 million, was the catalyst to the latest round allegations against Moonves, said New Yorker investigative reporter Ronan Farrow, who broke the Moonves news earlier this summer and wrote the follow-up story that was published Sunday morning.

Appearing on CNN, Farrow said the latest round of women to come forward did so now because they have been extraordinarily frustrated by what they perceive to be inaction on the part of CBS and its board. And that really is integral to what prompted this follow-up story.

Farrow noted that unlike outcomes in other #MeToo cases, the women were particularly frustrated to see that Moonves had been allowed to stay and continue to run the company and were determined he doesnt receive any compensation.

As of a couple of days ago, they were still talking about potentially letting him leave with a very generous exit package, up to the neighborhood of $100 million, Farrow said. They felt this was a board that has let a powerful man who makes a lot of money for this company, in the words of one person, get away with it.

Jessica Pallingston, a writer who told The New Yorker that Moonves coerced her into oral sex in the 1990s, called the potential settlement completely disgusting. He should take all that money and give it to an organization that helps survivors of sexual abuse, she told the publication.

After reading the story, actress Rachel Bloom, who stars in Crazy Ex-Girlfriend on the CW, which is co-owned by CBS, tweeted that as a company employees she thinks Moonves should be fired without getting a fucking dollar.

The actions described in this article are those of sexual assault and shame on anyone else in the corporation who knew about his crimes, she said.

Actor Charlie McDermott, who appears on the CBS-produced Netflix series Unbelievable, tweeted that a nine-figure severance package is hardly punishment for decades of targeted abuse toward female employees. Its disgusting.

The new accuserswho bring the total tally to 12told The New Yorker of far more serious allegations than those first made against the longtime executive in July. Describing incidents that allegedly occurred between the 1980s and early 2000s, several of the women also said Moonves set out to destroy their careers when they rebuffed his advances.

Veteran TV executive Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb reportedly filed a criminal complaint against Moonves in Los Angeles last year, accusing him of physically restraining her and forcing her to give him oral sex. Describing her 1986 encounter with Moonves to The New Yorker, Golden-Gottlieb said shed agreed to go out with him only to lunch, but he surprised her by taking her to a secluded area where she says, he grabbed my head and he took it all the way down onto his penis, and pushed his penis into my mouth.

Golden-Gottlieb didnt report it at the time, she said, because she knew he was the new golden boy at the Lorimar-Telepictures production company where the two worked together. Golden-Gottlieb said Moonves absolutely ruined her career when she rejected him years later.

Prosecutors reportedly found Golden-Gottliebs allegations to be credible but declined to press charges because the statute of limitations had expired. Several other women described similar incidents of unwanted touching, forced oral sex, and aggressive behavior.

Moonves, for his part, denied the latest allegations just hours before news of his departure broke on Sunday, admitting to consensual relations with three of the women but argued that the disturbing accusations in the report are part of a smear campaign.

In a statement late Sunday night, he doubled down, saying: Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me that are not consistent with who I am... I am deeply saddened to be leaving the company. I wish nothing but the best for the organization, the newly comprised board of director and all of its employees.

Times Up, the movement against sexual harassment set up in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, has called on CBS to provide complete transparency in its investigation of Moonves. CBS, as you sit in a room debating next steps to rectify the damage done, remember that the world is watching, the organization said in a statement Sunday."

2018-03-26,Daily Beast,Jeremy Corbyn the UK Labour Leader Was In Three Secret Anti-Semitic Facebook Groups,"The left-wing leader of the British Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has been condemned as a figurehead for anti-Semitism by Jewish leaders after a steady drip of reports over the past weeks revealed that he was a member of three secret Facebook groups in which people shared anti-Jewish conspiracies and propaganda, including one post where Corbyn directly criticized the removal of anti-Semitic graffiti.

The British Jewish Leadership Council posted an open letter to the Labour leader on Monday saying enough is enoughand accusing him of doing nothing to combat anti-Semitism in his partyafter it was revealed that he questioned the removal of an anti-Semitic mural in London that showed several offensive stereotypes of Jewish bankers playing a game of Monopoly on the backs of workers.

A tweet from a Jewish lawmaker in Corbyns own party, Member of Parliament Luciana Berger, revealed that he responded to the post in a Facebook group about the artwork being removed by saying: Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller destroyed Diego Vieras mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.

After his post was criticized over the weekend, Corbyn backtracked, insisting he didn't notice the anti-Semitic imagery at the time. ""I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic,"" he said. ""I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form.""

However, the old Facebook post is the latest in a string of reports which linked Corbyn to anti-Semitic Facebook groups. At the beginning of March he was revealed to have been in a group where terms such as ""ZioNazi"" were used and conspiracy theories about Jewish involvement in 9/11 were shared among members. U.K. politics blog Guido Fawkes has since revealed Corbyn's membership of two further groups where people shared offensive anti-Semitic content.

The trail of damning reports have provoked unprecedented criticism from Jewish leaders in the U.K. who have organized a protest outside of the British Houses of Parliament on Monday afternoon as Labour lawmakers hold their weekly group meeting insidethough Corbyn will reportedly not be attending this weeks event.

In a scathing open letter, the Jewish Leadership Council said: [Corbyn] never sees or understands the anti-Semitism, whether it is from overseas terrorist groups or local Facebook groups. Now, he belatedly acknowledges a mural was anti-Semitic. Like so much else in this area, it is far too little, far too late, with no serious attempt to understand or tackle the damage to Jews and the Labour Party.

The statement went on: Hizbollah commits terrorist atrocities against Jews, but Corbyn calls them his friends and attends pro-Hizbollah rallies in London. Exactly the same goes for Hamas. Raed Salah says Jews kill Christian children to drink their blood. Corbyn opposes his extradition and invites him for tea at the House of Commons. These are not the only cases. He is repeatedly found alongside people with blatantly anti-Semitic views, but claims never to hear or read them.

Corbyn has desperately attempted to stave off the growing criticism against him. In a statement Sunday, he apologized, saying he will not tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in and around our movement, and he promised to stamp out anti-Semitism that has occurred in pockets within the Labour Party, causing pain and hurt to our Jewish community in the Labour Party and the rest of the country.

But rather than follow his lead in being apologetic over the incidents, many of Corbyns supporters have leapt to his defense. The hashtag #PredictTheNextCorbynSmear trended on Twitter on Sunday evening, with supporters ridiculing the media over the Labour leaders supposed unfair treatment at the hands of newspapers and broadcasters who they believe have exaggerated his connections to anti-Semites.

A Jewish pro-Corbyn group, Jewish Voice for Labour, has also organized a counter-protest against the Jewish Leadership Councils gathering outside Parliament on Monday afternoon. The group said it was appalled by the open letter that criticized Corbyn, and said: They do not represent us or the great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyns vision for social justice and fairness.

Corbyn has said he will meet Jewish leaders to discuss the issue of anti-Semitism in the Labour party, but Jonathan Goldstein, the chair of the Jewish Leadership Council, said hed received no formal invitation as of Monday morning. Goldstein told BBC Radio that Corbyns apology for anti-Semitism in pockets within the Labour party did not go far enough.

This is the first time in my life time that the Jewish community has felt the need to take to the streets to campaign against the leader of a major political party, said Goldstein. Rightly or wrongly, Jeremy Corbyn is now the figurehead for an anti-Semitic political culture based upon obsessive hatred of Israel, conspiracy theories, and fake news and that is doing great harm not just to the Labour party but to Britain in a wider sense."
2018-07-06,Daily Beast,How Would Amy Coney Barretts Faith Affect Her Ruling on Non-Roe Matters,"During her September 2017 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Amy Coney Barrett talked about her seven childrentwo of whom (Vivian and John Peter) are adopted from Haiti, and a third (Benjamin) who has special needs.

If she is nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court next Monday night, this is a part of her story you have to understand. Vivian is our miracle, Barrett said (starting around the 26 minute mark). She was born in Haiti. She came home when she was 14 months old, and she weighed 11 pounds. And she was so weak we were told she might never walk normally or speak. Today Vivian is a track star, and I assure you she has no trouble talking.

John Peter is 10, she added. He was born in Haiti. He joined our family in 2010 when he was 3 years old, after the devastating earthquake. (The magnitude 7.1 Haitian earthquake in 2010 killed an estimated 220,000-300,000 people and displaced 1.5 million more. As a result, years later, more than 6 percent of Haitians were stricken with cholera.)

Benjamin, our youngest, is 5. He has special needs, Barrett continued. That presents unique challenges for all of us. But I think all you need to know about Benjamins place in the family is summed up by the fact the other children unreservedly identify him as their favorite sibling.

Everyone is focused on whether this devoutly Catholic judge would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, but her background as the adoptive parent of two Haitian children suggests that her interests in defending the dignity of human life doesnt end at childbirth. How might this worldview impact her decisions, should she be nominated?

During confirmation hearings, would she be asked about the Trump administrations decision to end temporary protected status for Haiti? The only danger here is the would you ask this if she was a man allegation. For me, the answer would be absolutely yes.

Another question: What if the issue of family separation made it to the high court?

This is clearly not the kind of issue that breaks down neatly along party lines, but if we are to agree that ones experience and worldvieweven if their goal is to simply call balls and strikes (and, like Barrett, I believe that something can be both constitutional and bad policyinfluences their decisions, one could speculate that Barrett might have a unique personal perspective on this issue.

The reason I say speculate is that Barrett hasnt ruled on any immigration cases that I can findunless you count a run-of-the-mill case where she joined another judges opinion (PDF).

Having clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and having worked as a Notre Dame law professor, Barrett boasts an impressive resume. Butand expect this to be an issue if she is nominatedBarrett has only served as a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit since early Novemberwhich means you will have to look elsewhere if you want to read the tea leaves. (For what its worth, the Seventh Circuit, which sits in Chicago, doesnt get many immigration cases, but it tends to be a pretty pro-immigrant court.)

People who want to predict how she might rule will likely look at her Catholic faith and assume one thing. But when you consider the personal sacrifices she has made in her family, one realizes that things are more complicated than the typical left-versus-right paradigm we are force-fed.

It would be interesting to see how a Justice Barrett would rule on immigration cases, David Lat, founder of Above the Law, a legal news website, tells me. Her critics try to claim that her Catholic faith would affect her abortion decisions, even though she has made clear that she would not let religion influence her work as a judge. But these same critics never suggest that Catholic social teaching might make her moderate or liberal on an issue like immigration. How a judges personal background influences her work as a judge is a very complex matter that cant be easily predicted or generalized about.

Should a judges background even matter? Sonia Sotomayor took a lot of flak for her wise Latina comments, but the explanation she presented during her confirmation hearing may be appropriate here: Life experiences do influence us in good ways, Sotomayor said. Thats why we seek the enrichment of our legal system from life experiences, but thats not what drives a result. The impartiality is an understanding that the law is what drives the result... I wasnt encouraging the belief that I thought that (life experiences) should drive the result.

Likewise, Barrett,  with the richness of her experiences, could, perhaps, add some diversity to the court.

If you want to get a sense of someones values, look further than their resume. Amy Coney Barrett is living hers."
2018-02-08,Daily Beast,Why Kosovo Wants Trumps Help,"PRISTINA, KosovoIt has been almost two decades since the United States led a sustained NATO military operation in the skies over these lands that, by some lights, could be counted the most successful war in history: over the course of 78 days and 38,000 bombing sorties, not a single American soldier was lost in combat. Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader in Belgrade who spilled so much blood in the Balkans in the 1990s, and especially in Kosovo, was soon toppled and tried for war crimes, and this little nation that had seen so much suffering, finally, just 10 years ago, gained its independence.

But all did not live happily ever after.

Kosovo's prime minister, the former guerilla fighter Ramush Haradinaj, had a lot on his mind this week as he prepared to make his first visit to the United States on Wednesday. In a sit-down interview with The Daily Beast, he said he was planning to talk with the Pentagon and the State Department about the security issues threatening a stable future of Kosovo.

Specifically, the PM spoke of a triple threat: the unresolved conflict with Moscow-backed Serbia, Kosovars being recruited to fight for Islamic State forces, and mafia groups allegedly running the northern part of Kosovo, where the top politician and would-be peacemaker, Oliver Ivanovic, was murdered just last month.

Next week, the Republic of Kosovo, whose two million people are mostly of Albanian backgrounds, will celebrate 10 years of independence. But once again, Kosovo and Serbia are blaming each other for ongoing violence.

The world should not ignore any aspects of the sensitivity in this region, Prime Minister Haradinaj told The Daily Beast.

The Mitrovica Bridge is the crossing point between the south of Kosovo with its ethnic Albanian population from the northern part, populated by ethnic Serbs.

In 2016 it was renovated and reopened after several years when it was closed to traffic. The Mitrovica Bridge ""will become the symbol of normalization of relations between the Kosovo Serb, Kosovo Albanian, and other communities,"" declared a statement from the European Union.

On Tuesday, a Kosovo police vehicle blocked the way across. The area felt deserted. But nobody stopped pedestrians from walking to Mitrovicas northern side, where piles of bricks and ruined buildings evoked memories of the regions crises, fear and violence.

A big mural on the wall was similar those you see in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, a city celebrating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kosovo is Serbia, Crimea is Russia, it said. Serbs supported the Kremlins policy in Ukraine even here in Kosovo.

One of the ruined buildings on the square across the bridge was a former center of Russian-Serb friendship. Somebody set the building on fire last year. Kosovo police, also divided between Albanian and Serb nationals in the northern part of Mitrovica, evacuated the residents from the burning building. But so far, authorities have failed to find the attackers.

Half of President Putins face still can be seen on a poster glued to the billboard facing the bridge; next to it is a poster calling to vote for a prominent Serb politician, the late Oliver Ivanovic. The slogan next to his portrait, Regardless, there are still many of us, sounds tragic today, a few weeks after the popular politician was gunned down outside of his office in the center of town.

There are not many politicians as brave as Ivanovic, willing to call on Kosovos Serbs to live in peace with the authorities in Pristina.

Much like the Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, Ivanovic was gunned down with six bullets in the back shot from a 9 mm pistol.

Silvana Arsovic, the politicians secretary, heard shots and screams on the morning of January 16. She ran outside and found Ivanovic on the sidewalk by the porch of their Citizens Initiative party headquarters.

Ive felt numb ever since that day; local people, who loved Ivanovic, now fear approaching our office. Arsovic stopped sobbing and lit a cigarette. There is no hope left in Mitrovica, the place is managed by mafia gangs with police that have not investigated a single crime, she told The Daily Beast.

Dr. Dragis Milovic, Ivanovic's ally in the peace process, had foreseen the murder of his friend. Ivanovic reported to Belgrade about mafia taking control in the region, so first the criminals burned my car, then some men driving a black Audi asked my daughter how she had liked my burned vehicle, Milovic recalled as we sat in his office at the local hospital on Tuesday.  ""So then I said to Ivanovic that they would kill us next.

The Americans and their allies who played such an important role in the 1999 war for Kosovo have never left. Although the forces have been drawn down over the years, hundreds of U.S. soldiers are deployed to Camp Bondsteel in the east of the country, and are quick to say, as one told a Defense Department news report, Our primary mission in Kosovo is law enforcement.

NATO soldiers from several different countries patrol the streets of Mitrovic in an effort to provide security. In Mitrovica we have a high concentration of NATO, U.N. and E.U. military, and still Ivanovics murder took place right on the street in daylight, Una Hajdari, a representative of Reporters Without Borders, a non-profit organization defending freedom of information, told The Daily Beast.

A professional, well-trained shooter killed Ivanovic with six bullets, hitting within an area of ten centimeters, said Dr. Milovic, who had examined the body and noted the tight pattern.  We would like to see Russian or any Western investigators get involved to find out the truth about his murder.

Kosovo has been on Moscows mind ever since Ivanovics assassination. Speaking at a recent press conference, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recalled that the Balkans have been a source for very serious conflicts in the past. I hope everybody understands how necessary it is not to allow the same military confrontation. The tensions have been increasing, significantly.

Pristina does not like to hear from Moscow.

Prime Minister Haradinaj said he doubted the Kremlin is truly concerned about stability in Balkans. On the contrary, he told The Daily Beast, We believe that Russia is only interested in keeping the region in crisis to be able to prove that the West, Europe and Washington, are unable to solve it.

Russias agenda of waking up nationalistic disruptions is disturbing, interfering or blocking the progress in the region, said Haradinaj. All of us should be against such a role in our region.

Serbian politicians blame Kosovo authorities for discrediting and attacking non-Albanian minorities.  Igor Simic, a politician from Serbian List, a Serb nationalist party, said he did not expect Kosovo to find Ivanovics assassins.

Instead of letting international organizations investigate this crime, Pristina authorities use the murder to say that the north populated with Serbs is too criminal, that it is impossible to live here, Simic told The Daily Beast.

The problem posed by Kosovars recruited into the ranks of the Islamic State and their families is a major one for this country, and a matter of real concern to Washington and to Europe.

In the past three years, more than 300 local Muslims have joined radical militant groups in Syria and Iraq. Kosovo police and prosecutors have been very cautious repatriating citizens coming back from the Middle East. As noted by Anne Speckhard of the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism, Kosovo has the unique distinction of having the highest per capita number of citizens of any country in wider Europe who left for Syria and Iraq since 2011. Forty-four women and 29 children from Kosovo are also believed to have traveled to the conflict zones in Iraq and Syria.

Our issue is ISIS women, who have children with non-Kosovars, the Prime Minister Haradinaj told The Daily Beast. Sometimes we do not know who these women had babies with. They could be children of ISIS commanders. Radical NGOs and local imams have created systematic propaganda for more than a decade, sometimes making the idea of joining attractive by making financial offers to uneducated kids.

The family of Shqipe Ajdini and and her husband Qendrim Sejdu have been trying to recover from their Syria experience in their poor, wood-heated home in a Kosovo village of Viti, not far from the Macedonia border. Ajdini was 31 years old when her first husband took her and their 3-year-old daughter Sara on a vacation, first to Montenegro, then to Turkey and across the border to Syria.

I am still haunted by my past in Syria, Ajdini, a conservative Salafi woman in a hijab, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.

Her first husband left her and their child in a dorm full of other women from all over the world, she said. The rooms were crowded, husbands rarely came to visit their wives, and never for a night.

Some women were happy about ISIS ideology. Others, like me, felt terrified, trapped and abandoned.

Ajdinis first husband was killed in Iraq one month after their arrival in ISIS controlled territories. She managed to escape through Syria in 2015, return to Kosovo and soon got married to Sejdu, who, just like her, was disillusioned by ISIS ideology.

Imams and mainly Internet propaganda helped to recruit young Kosovars, who had no jobs and dreamed of four wives and thousands of dollars, Sejdu told The Daily Beast.

With all these problems, what is the little nation of Kosovo to do? There is no question where it looks for help. It relies on its friendship with the United States and, now, with President Donald Trump.

Forgotten are the reports that came out in 2016 reminding Kosovars that Trump disapproved in 1999 of the way the Clinton administration handled the Kosovo War.

I would have done it a little bit differently, Trump told talk-show host Larry King, playing fast and loose with the facts. And I know this would sound terrible. But look at the havoc that they have wreaked in Kosovo. I mean, we could say we lost very few people. Of course, we had airplanes 75,000 feet up in the air dropping bombs. But, look at what we've done to that land and to those people and the deaths that we've caused. ... So, you know, I don't know if they consider that a success because I can't consider it a success. ... They bombed the hell out of a country, out of a whole area, everyone is fleeing in every different way, and nobody knows what's happening, and the deaths are going on by the thousands.

Today, Kosovo gives Trumps leadership a higher approval rating75 percentthan any other country in the world, according to a Gallup poll in January. And the prime minister on his way to Washington was full of praise for the American presidents policies.

We think it is very important for the leader of the world to support the army and the economy. As we saw during the [1999] war, all arguments end when there is a strong army, Ramush Haradinaj told The Daily Beast."
2018-03-02,Daily Beast,Russia Recruited Me as a Spy Heres What They Wanted,"Do you have a copy of the letter, Captain Oleg Kulikov asked me.

He looked excited as he watched my face for any reaction. I had just told the Russian intelligence officer that I had been accepted into the United States Navys Reserve Intelligence program, and would soon be an intelligence officer.

Months before that, I had handed Oleg copies of various paperwork about both the program and my application but now he wanted morehe wanted to bring back more solid evidence for his superiors documenting the importance of the man he had recruited to spy for Russia. It was one of our many conversations that relied on face-to-face meetings, that allowed me to fool the veteran Russian spy into believing that he was recruiting me, while in fact I was an FBI operational asset.

Its no surprise that Russia is actively involved in collecting intelligence on the United States and running operations to undermine America. It is a craft Russia has honed and carried out since the fledgling days of the Cold War, and one that special counsel Robert Muellers indictment of 13 Russians, with more reportedly coming, re-enforces is still very much active.

While Muellers indictment doesnt mention the Russian government, it presents methodssuch as sending covert agents to operate clandestinely in the United Statesthat are hallmarks of their intelligence services. Russian intelligence officers arrive in the United States, often posing as diplomats, in what is known as non-official cover. As Muellers indictment puts it, they come for the purpose of collecting intelligence to inform Defendants operations.

From my own experience working as a double-agent against Russian intelligence from 2005 to 2009, I know that they collect that intelligence by targeting and recruiting Americans to serve as operational assets.

In the digital age, a common question is why the need to recruit spies? Couldnt spy services simply collect intelligence from afar? Why risk sending Russians to the United States?

As I learned from my years speaking with Russian intelligence, they are distrustful if not paranoid. As such, I found that the Russians sought to temper their suspicions by understanding the source that is providing them with intelligencesomething that requires face-to-face meetings. It is why, for example, in spite of my repeated offers to provide intelligence files over email or other ways that did not require us to meet in person, my handlers steadfastly refused and insisted on meeting to speak with me. These meetings, I learned, were critical in evaluating me. If they didnt trust me, then they couldnt trust the intelligence I was passing them. Oh the other hand, if they could validate me and trust me as a source then that trust was extended to the intelligence I provided them.

There was another reason for relying on trusted assets for intelligence: protecting the information that Russia sought. The paranoia of Russian intelligence extended to the belief that they were under constant surveillance by the FBIa notion that gains credibility in the detailed description of emails and conversations released in Muellers most recent indictment.

The value of intelligence collected by Russian intelligence officers was severely diminished if the FBI discovered that Russia had collected it, which is why they chose to have me collect intelligence instead of trying to do so themselves. And in an era of endless and potentially everlasting digital breadcrumbs, it was far better to let an America source collect intelligence and hand it over then risk compromise and detection by doing it themselves.

That same paranoia, I found, made the Russians highly selective in who they chose to recruit. Showing up with a juicy piece of classified intelligence was not enough. They wanted to understand why somebody would be willing to spy for them. The answer to that question was as important, if not more so, than the intelligence an asset could provide.

It was not enough that I was a young man intent on joining the United States Navy as an intelligence officer, my Russian case officer had to believe that I wanted to spy for Russia. This meant creating a persona that would meet the Russian profile of a spy. While I couldnt change my name or where I lived or went to college, I could invent a caricature of a person I believed the Russians were looking for. So I played the part of a young arrogant man obsessed with money who saw service in the Navy singularly as a way to access information he could sell Russia to enrich himself. It was a profile the Russians understood and accepted, and ultimately the reason they allowed me into their network of spies.

With the news that Jared Kushners Top Secret clearance had been downgraded, I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I am sure that Russia continues to recruit Americans to support its intelligence operations, and continue to have a similar profile of the type of person that is susceptible to such overturessomeone who is willing to sell for profit access and information from the office they hold.

There is no longer much question that Russia recruited Americans to help in their attack on the 2016 elections. The question, rather, is who. It is a question I am sure Robert Mueller is seeking to answer.

2018-08-13,Daily Beast,Exclusive Hacked Emails Take Us Inside the Billionaires Club Around Vladimir Putin,"At first glance, little separates Andrey Pavlov from thousands of other wealthy Russians who do business in the West. The lawyer, who turned 40 last year, travels across Europes luxury resorts, stays in five-star hotels, eats in the best restaurants, and hires concierge services to track down exclusive $17,000 Hermes handbags for his wife.

But Pavlov, an unassuming man of middling build and height with short brown hair, may be one of the most influential Russians youve never heard of, with a set of unique connections across the elites of Russia and Eastern Europenot to mention London and Washington, D.C.which typify the elaborate networks of connections and influence that have come to attract huge media and government attention in the early years of Donald Trumps presidency.

Pavlov has engaged some of the worlds biggest law firms to act on behalf of him and his clients, has encouraged a former U.K. attorney general to lobby on his behalf, and has hired the consultancy firm part-owned by U.K. and Australian election maestro Lynton Crosby.

Yet hes also embroiled in a huge international row over an alleged $230 million Russian fraud that left a lawyer tortured to death in a Russian prison; is closely tied to the Russian and Kazakh interior ministries; and is even alleged to have acted as a mediator between a Russian whistleblower and an alleged criminal gang, shortly before the whistleblower was found deadwith U.S. intelligence pointing blame for the death directly at Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Pavlovs jetset lifestyle embodies the elaborate network of connections between the Russian state and Western elites that special counsel Robert Mueller is now charged with investigating. Like most people in this world, Pavlov has always been a closed bookuntil now.

The Daily Beast is able to shed unprecedented light on how Pavlov and those around him operate, thanks to a circumstance all too familiar to Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta, the Democratic National Committee, and others: The contents of Pavlovs emails were leaked and posted online following what he says was a hacking attack to an obscure site used by hackers to dump their finds. (The identity of Pavlovs hackers is not known, and Pavlov has not publicly speculated on it.)

This rare cache of documents, plus court records from cases across the U.S. and detailed reporting, give a rare insight into the complex nexus of connections in which Pavlov residesa network that draws in interests connected to Putin and also business connections of President Trump.

They also reveal the way Russia and its oligarchs and outriders workdrawing together those in the Western establishment, its top businesses, and its numerous middlemen into the intrigues of the Russian state, its satellites, and its wealthy power players.

In 2007, according to a complaint filed by U.S. prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, Andrey Pavlov was on a trip to Cyprus. Rather than just a sunny mini-break, the prosecutors allege, Pavlov was meeting with a number of officials from the Russian Interior Ministry and a man called Dmitry Klyuev, whom he had known since 2001. Klyuev, the U.S. prosecutors allege, was the ringleader of a multimillion-dollar fraud concocted on that tripone that left a man dead in a Russian prison and which has sparked a years-long diplomatic row with an oddly central role in Trumps rise to power.

It was this alleged fraudreferred to as the Magnitsky case, after a lawyer who died pursuing itthat prompted the meeting in Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya to discuss dirt on Clinton, a meeting Trumps former lawyer Michael Cohen now claims the president knew about.

It was also the Magnitsky case that was directly raised by Putin in his summit with Trump in July, as a poor faith quid quo pro for allowing interviews with Russian intelligence officials over email hacking. The lobbying and work around the Magnitsky casein which Pavlovs emails show he was centralhave had world-shaking consequences.

The row began with an alleged elaborate tax fraud that saw $230 million taken from the coffers of the Russian government through a bogus refund scheme, according to the prosecutors complaint. Pavlov is accused by U.S. prosecutors of being a central player in that alleged fraud and its aftermath, and he has lobbied across the world against sanctions being imposed in response to it.

The prosecutors alleged that a Russian criminal gang had managed to re-register companies belonging to a hedge fund based in the U.S. and U.K.Hermitage Capitalto themselves, before orchestrating sham lawsuits that awarded massive damages against them. This meant the companies were then eligible for huge tax refunds, owing to their lawsuit-induced losses, which were then siphoned into numerous offshore accounts belonging to the conspirators.

The U.S. prosecution document is laced with details that tie Pavlov to the alleged fraud from its very inceptionclaims he has consistently denied.

Russian Interior Ministry officials helped organize raids on Hermitage Capital in which materials, including the companys documents and official seals, were takenallowing, the prosecutors allege, for documents and contracts to be forged to enable the tax fraud.

When the sham lawsuits came to court, the U.S. contends, Pavlov was among the lawyers representing the stolen companies in cases they say were orchestrated... for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining large money judgements, appearing in different cases to be purportedly acting both for and against the stolen companies.

The scheme worked, and the companies obtained around $230 million in fraudulent tax refundsat which point the Russian state swiftly moved against the companies original owner, Hermitage Capital Management, which was left trying to defend itself against a fraud it claimed to be totally unaware of.

To help it unpack what had happened, and defend itself, Hermitage engaged its own lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who quickly began filing criminal complaints against Klyuev and other alleged co-conspirators in the fraud.

By October 2008, Magnitsky had publicly testified on multiple occasions against Klyuev and Russian Interior Ministry officials he alleged were behind the fraudonly to see one such official, Lt. Col. Artem Kuznetsov, be placed in charge of the investigation.

Magnitsky was arrested within a month. He was held in pre-trial detention for almost a year before being found dead in his cell in November 2009. A human rights report found he had been denied necessary medical care in custody, had been beaten by eight guards with rubber batons on the last day of his life, and when found on the brink of death in his cell, the ambulance crew that was called to treat him as he was dying was deliberately kept outside of his cell for one hour and 18 minutes until he was dead.

Bill Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital, worked relentlessly to publicize the case as part of an international Justice for Magnitsky campaign, which garnered huge international press coverage before coming to the attention of lawmakers in the U.S. and the EU. There it quickly came to spell trouble for Pavlov and his associates, as the West contemplated instituting sanctions against the people alleged to bear responsibility for the fraud, and directly or indirectly for Magnitskys death in a Russian jail. Separately, U.S. prosecutors began pursuing civil recovery of U.S. assets they believed may have been obtained as proceeds of the fraud.

It was here that the documents show Pavlov began to take action to attempt to protect his name against the allegations he and others facedand he wasnt short of influential Western firms to turn to for advice.

There has been extensive coverage of the connections between Trumps businesses and Russian interests, but ties between Russia and Western political fixers, former government ministers, and big businesses are becoming business as usualas Pavlovs email cache detailing his lobbying efforts show.

He began in October 2013 by contacting the Washington, D.C., law firm Akin Gumpone of the worlds biggestfor assistance. The firm in turn suggested Pavlov could turn to FTI Consulting, a multinational business advisory firm, to help tackle the New York prosecutors report.

After a meeting with Pavlov, FTI offered a proposal of $200,000 for an initial piece of work investigating the case.

We think we are in a very strong position to assist you in this matter, the proposal stated. The primary goal of the investigation will be to rigorously scrutinize the claims made by those alleging a conspiracy. A secondary goal, which we would pursue to the extent possible, will be to develop an alternate narrative documenting what really happened.

FTI then offered Pavlov two ways in which the work could be carried outdepending how much control he wanted over what it looked into.

Sometimes, in cases like this one, clients ask us to conduct a fully independent investigation... the value proposition is you could present our work product as the result of an investigation that you did not direct, it stated. The other approach would be more collaborative... we would seek your guidance on how to handle various issues.

In this instance, Pavlov appears not to have pursued FTIs offer of an investigation, whether independent or directed by him. Though the U.S. Congress did pass sanctions against a number of individuals alleged to have been involved in the fraud, Pavlov was not at the time considered for this listonly to be added to it under significant political pressure in December 2017.

In the EU, things were going less well, as the EU parliament was on the verge of signing a resolution stating the EU should deny visas to and freeze the EU assets of 32 Russian officials involved in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. Though this would have no legal force, it could serve to encourage action from EU governments or its counsel and would serve to implicate all those named in the resolution in connection with the fraud and its consequences.

Pavlov turned this time to the law firm Debovoise & Plimpton to see what it could do, seeking out Lord Peter Goldsmith, the former U.K. attorney general who wrote the legal advice enabling Britains involvement in the Iraq War, to add value to his case on the international stage.

Goldsmith acted for both Pavlov and another person named on the European parliaments list, Konstantin Ponomarev, to challenge the sanctions recommendation. Ponomarev urged Debevoise & Plimpton, where Goldsmith is a partner, to use the peers name on a letter to be sent to EU officials of the pairs behalf.Pls ask Lord Goldsmith to sign it, he wrote in an email also sent to Pavlov. His signature on this letter adds value to my positions not only in the EU but also in the RF [Russian Federation].

Ponomarev was keen for this letter to be made public to put the receiving official in a stupid position if she does not respond. Goldsmith billed at 960 an hour for his work toward the case.

Pavlov also engaged a PR firm owned in part by Lynton Crosby, the election guru behind the ruling Conservative Partys 2015 and 2017 campaigns in the U.K., as well as Australian election campaigns, to act in the Magnitsky casethough Crosby himself did not make representations in these cases.

In the correspondence, Pavlovs lawyers describe Crosbys firm, CTF Partners, to him as the lobbying firm. CTF is not registered as an outside lobbyist on either the U.K. or the EU registers of lobbyists. CTF said the project it undertook for Pavlov was a matter of background research and unrelated to lobbying.

However, Pavlovs efforts proved futile: both he and Ponomarev were named on the final resolution, which passed the EUs parliament in 2014.

This was the backdrop of the meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016in the midst of the presidential campaignbetween Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-connected lawyer Veselnitskaya, who was involved in lobbying against Magnitsky-related sanctions, during which she apparently offered dirt on Clinton.

Unlike Pavlov, there are no allegations Veselnitskaya was involved in the original fraud behind the Magnitsky case, but she has worked as a campaigner against the ensuing sanctions since and is a known associate of Pavlov. The two were photographed together attending a screening of a film against the Magnitsky sanctions in the EU parliament and are Facebook friends.

U.S. prosecutors are also eager to explore the level of connection between Veselnitskaya and Pavlov, having served the latter with a subpoena for his correspondence with her and others when he made a short trip to the U.S. in 2016, a time before he was affected by U.S. sanctions.

There is one more twist in Pavlovs alleged role in the Magnitsky saga: a U.K. coroners court has heard allegations he was involved in a second death connected to it, a charge he has resolutely denied.

In November 2012, Alexander Perepilichnyya one-time alleged conspirator in the case, who had turned whistleblower and was living in exile in Britaindied while jogging, in a case initially judged to be a natural death.

Authorities have been accused of missing numerous pieces of evidence around Perepilichnyys death, which is on a list of possible Russian assassinations on U.K. soil kept by U.S. intelligence officials, which was uncovered by BuzzFeed News.

Pavlov met Perepilichnyy in the months before the latters death. Perepilichnyy reportedly referred to Pavlov as a Russian Interior Ministry official with whom he was seeking rapprochement. In the inquest into Perepilichnyys deathwhich is still ongoing nearly six years laterthe court heard Pavlov was in the country at the time of the whistleblowers demise, left the day after, and was certainly in any view a candidate for the killing of Mr Perepilichnyy, according to a lawyer working for the firm providing Perepilichinyys life insurance.

Pavlov has firmly denied the allegation, telling The Atlantic he had only been in England for a matter of hours, and had only learned of Perepilichnyys death days after. The inquest has yet to rule.

The Magnitsky case is not the only international controversy in which Pavlov has a hand, thoughnor the only one with connections to those in Trumps orbit. And while Perepilichnyy may have overstated things if he suggested Pavlov worked for the Russian Interior Ministry, Pavlovs emails reveal a very close working relationship with itas the case of the row between a billionaire in exile, the Kazakh government, and a female lawyer caught in the middle of it shows.

In April 2014, Olena Tyshchenkoa Ukranian lawyer, mother of four, and key witness in the U.K.s biggest ever fraud caseemailed a senior partner at the London office of one of the worlds largest law firms, Hogan Lovells.

Her email detailed a string of allegations against the firm and one of its clients, a preeminent Kazakh bank. Her accusations were grave: that she had been arrested in Russia on false pretenses, visited in isolation cells by lawyers acting against her to give false evidence, kept in illegal custody, and forcefully taken to Kazakhstan.

I was released only after I signed the agreement [to cooperate as a witness] written by Hogan Lovells, she wrote in the furious email. This you all understand looks bad and illegal.

The email, and all of the serious allegations of witness intimidation and contamination, arrived soon afterward after being forwarded through a middleman into the inbox of Pavlov, one of the people present in the cellaccording to a transcript produced by Kazakh authorities and emailed to Pavlovwhere Tyshchenko claims she was interrogated, without a lawyer, under armed guard.

The case in question was that of Mukhtar Ablyazov, a Kazakh banker and political rival of the countrys president. Ablyazov was accused of a multibillion-pound fraud against BTA Bank (in which he was once the largest shareholder, but which was subsequently nationalized) but had protested that his prosecution was politically motivated. After the bank was nationalized in 2009, Ablyazov fled Kazakhstan and later received political asylum in the U.K. Multiple human-rights groups had spoken out against his attempted extradition.

Ablyazovs legal case, aspects of which are still ongoing, has involved dozens of hearings in U.K. and French courts, and is one of the largest and most lucrative ever seen in Western Europe, with the Financial Times reporting that more than 50 solicitors and 32 barristersincluding eight queens counsels or prominent lawyershave worked on the case since 2012.

BTA alleges Ablyazov misappropriated up to $6 billion in bank funds and assets, and the bank has spent over five years pursuing him in the U.K. courts through numerous sets of high-stakes proceedings.

Ablyazov was granted political asylum in the U.K. but fled the country in 2012 to France after being held in of contempt of court related to seizure of funds and disclosing information relating to the case. Civil proceedings relating to seizing his assets continued in his absence.

One such High Court hearing, in July 2013, was attended by Olena Tyshchenko, a confidante and legal adviser to Ablyazov. As she left the U.K. court, she was photographed by private investigators working for Diligence, a security firm founded by former MI5 and CIA staff, hired by Hogan Lovellsphotos that were then passed to and published by the U.K. press.

The investigators managed to follow Tyshchenko across London and into France, as she visited Ablyazov in his hideawaya villa near Cannes. He was arrested by French authorities in connection to his alleged bank fraud in an armed raid soon afterward, and the story of how he was tracked downalong with some of the surveillance photosleaked to the press.

Ablyazov, though, was not the only one to be arrested. Tyshchenko herself was arrested by Russian authorities and kept in custody for four months, until she agreed to be a cooperative witness for BTA as well as for Russian and Kazakh authorities.

The emails of Pavlov shed light on months of correspondence between Kazakh authorities, Pavlov, and one of the worlds most respected law firmsfrom which Trump later hired his own lawyer Ty Cobb, who was not directly involved in this case.

The cache shows the peril faced by people, like Tyshchenko, who get caught in the wheels in battles between oligarchs and autocrats, even when they are ostensibly being fought through Western courts. Documents in the email cache show Pavlov was present during an extended interrogation of an obviously traumatized Tyshchenko by both Russian and Kazakh Interior Ministry officials in prison in Moscow during November 2013.

A transcript of the interrogation was sent to Pavlov by the Kazakhstan prosecutors office and has been professionally translated and reviewed by The Daily Beast.

The documents confirm the close involvement of Kazakh authorities in Ablyazovs casewhich Amnesty International has repeatedly warned would suggest political motivation for the extradition request.

Early in the transcript, the Kazakh prosecutor explains to Tyshchenko he will not interview her with her lawyer present. The lawyers will be [here] shortly, you will consult with them whether you wish to or not, he says. I will explain why I will not be interrogating you in their presence.

Soon afterward, he tells Tyshchenko, They [Kazakhstan] dont want there to be any kinds of false rumours about your being pressured or any kind of illegal activities.

She interrupts: When there are three armed men with me and Im handcuffed?

He responds: This is only common procedure which is not dictated by us, its dictated by the law. Because we have you here and you consider yourself a law-abiding citizen. But there are some people who do not share this opinion. Sometimes they will attempt to escape.

During the lengthy exchanges, Tyshchenko speaks of her anguish at her situation, especially at being separated from her children, with little opportunity to speak to them.

Theres going to be a dead body in the isolation cell, dont you understand? I cant take it anymore, she tells her captors.

Soon afterward, in December 2013, Tyshchenko agreed to sign an agreement drafted by Hogan Lovells to cooperate with BTA Bank in its actions against Ablyazov, including turning over evidence in the U.K. and France, and ceasing all association with Ablyazov, documentation in the email cache shows.

The agreement included a promise to waive any entitlement to claim legal professional privilege. In exchange, Tyshchenko herself would be freed from the threat of prosecution.

The final deal, signed by Tyshchenko, was sent by Pavlov to Hogan Lovells on Dec. 20. It was accompanied by a handwritten note from Tyshchenko to Hogan Lovells partner Chris Hardman.

I fully understand the meaning of the said agreement and its statements and consequences of its signing, she states, also confirming she had enough time to receive relevant professional advice before signing.

Within days of its signing, Hardman was flying to Moscow to meet with Tyshchenko, discussing the meeting with Pavlov and inviting him to sit in. If not, do you have any thoughts on how to get the best out of her? he asks.

Hardmans professional profile at Hogan Lovells prominently advertises his role in the BTA case.

His work on the BTA Bank matter, for instance, has been universally lauded and has been described as extraordinary litigation on a large scale and the most ground-breaking recent case by common consensus, it states.

Tyshchenkos cooperation with authorities secured her release from detention and resulted in a large handover of documents and evidence to BTA, its lawyers, and Russian and Kazakh authorities.

But by April 2014just a few months laterall was not well. Pavlov received an email from Pavel Prosyankin, a senior BTA executive, using the alias Peter Pan, of action points from a coordination meeting between BTA, Russian, and Kazakh authorities, including recommending coordinating responses between state security agencies.

One point on the list was Annulling O. Yu. Tyshchenkos amnesty and working with her moving forwards. Her deal had provided a great deal of evidence and laid the foundations for questioning new persons of interest, they stated, but they complained she is currently avoiding travel to the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. As a result, the document states, the Russian Federations prosecutors office had annulled her agreement.

This provoked Tyshchenkos furious and panicked emails to Michael Roberts, another Hogan Lovells partner working on the BTA case, about the circumstances of her cooperation.

Speaking about the canceled amnesty, Tyshchenko stated, I am preparing the statement to withdraw all my evidence as given under duress.

She made a bulleted list of allegations against Prosyankin, Pavlov, and Hardman.

- the fact that I was arrested on the basis of false evidence given by Messrs Prosiankin and Pavlov as well as statement of Mr Hardman, who mentioned in his statement he was saying what the Client had told him but nevertheless he then told me it depended on him whom to arrest, which means he is seriously involved in illegal influence on the investigators;

- numerous visits of Mr Pavlov and Mr Prosiankin to the isolator where I was kept and pressure they applied on me to give evidence including false evidence ...

- that I was released only after I signed the agreement written by Hogan Lovels; [sic]

- that when I was released I was forcefully taken to Kazakhstan by KNB [Kazakhstans intelligence agency];

and numerous other breaches of law - together constitute serious crime and corruption under the Russian law and not only.

Tyshchenko further noted that some of the Russian lawyers and investigators involved in the caseincluding Pavlovwere accused of involvement in the Magnitsky case.

Two out of three investigators in the group are from Magnitsky list and you, being American company, are cooperating with them till now, she stated. This all as you understand [sic] looks bad and illegal.

A few days later Tyshchenko sent a calmer email, repeating the allegations that she had received threats from a BTA staffer and that BTA was involved in reopening the criminal case against her in Russia, but pledged to assist as agreed if her case could be closed once and for all.

Both emails were forwarded by Prosyankinusing his Peter Pan aliasto Pavlov within days of being received by Hogan Lovells.

The Daily Beast sent Hogan Lovells a detailed series of inquiries based on the extensive email correspondence. A spokeswoman for the firm said it would not be appropriate for it to respond in detail but sent a statement from Hardman, the partner in the firm who worked on the case.

Hogan Lovells, of course, denies any involvement in witness intimidation, he said. Its role in the investigation into Tyshchenko in Russia, he claimed, was limited to one of its partners giving evidence to the authorities about Tyshchenkos involvement with Ablyazov, when requested to do so.

Mrs. Tyshchenkos allegations in this regard were withdrawn shortly after they were made and she cooperated with BTA Bank in its efforts to recover its losses caused by the frauds perpetrated by Mr. Ablyazov and his associates.

Tyshchenko, who was later appointed as an anti-corruption investigator for the Ukrainian government, still insists her detention was politically motivated.

It is not illegal, nor even necessarily immoral, for any Western citizen or business to have dealings with Russia or its satellitesas billions of dollars of Russian investment into London property and American lawyers signals, its become a key component in Western economies.

But as Pavlovs email cache highlights, nor is it simple. Working out where businesses, alleged criminals, governments, and state agencies end and begin is all but impossible, and often comes with considerable moral ambiguityespecially as so many Russian stories, from alleged assassinations, to frauds, to business deals, to lobbying, intertwine and interconnect.

These interconnections have now taken center stage in American politics, thanks to the U.S. presidents years-long dealings with Russia: Trump and his family have their own connections with almost every entity involved in this story.

Trump hired his former lawyer Cobb from Hogan Lovells. Trump contemplated a hotel project in Georgia with ties to Ablyazov and BTA Bank. Trump associates contemplated a Trump Tower in Astana, Kazakhstans capital, after Ablyazovs fall. Trump Jr. met with Veselnitskaya, Pavlovs friend, in Trump Tower to discuss the Magnitsky sanctions during the 2016 election campaign.

In the strange whorl of the Russian orbit, where everything is connected, Trump and his team pop up at each point. Perhaps most infamously of all, as Mueller detailed in an indictment published just days before Trump met Putin, Russian intelligence interfered to hack the emails of Clinton associates and published online by WikiLeaks, an act that came to dominate U.S. election coverage for weeksin a bid to help Trump win the 2016 election.

And yet on the flip side, Pavlov found himself in the same position as those in the DNC. Unknown hackers targeted his emails, which were for a time available online (The Daily Beast was passed a link to them by another journalist), before being removed from the torrent site upon which they were shared.

When asked about the publication of his emails and his comment on their contents, Pavlov responded by email. The cache posted online was, he wrote, hacked and stolen emails and the information within was privileged, adding, your findings are factually wrong and highly defamatory, though he did not provide any specific details."
2018-11-15,Daily Beast,Inside Aaron Hernandezs Perfect World and His Deadly Fall From Grace,"O.J. Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife and her friend in 1994. Ray Carruth was convicted of conspiring to kill his pregnant wife in 2001. Ray Rice was indicted for third-degree aggravated assault for punching out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City casino elevator in 2014. And Darren Sharper was found guilty of multiple rape charges in 2016 and sentenced to 20 years in jail.

Yet in the annals of NFL infamy, no player is quite as notorious as Aaron Hernandez, the star tight end for the New England Patriots who was condemned to life in prison after he was found guilty in 2015 of murdering Odin Lloydone of three violent crimes he allegedly perpetrated that decade.

For a young man who had the world in the palm of his hand (replete with a brand new $40 million contract), only to throw it away in a hail of gunfire, Hernandezs conviction was a catastrophic fall from grace. Moreover, in light of his celebrity status and blindingly bright future, it was an almost unimaginable turn of eventsthe sort of thing that, no matter which way you looked at it, made little sense.

Premiering at DOC NYC on Nov. 14, My Perfect World: The Aaron Hernandez Story attempts to get inside its subjects head in order to comprehend why a successful sports icon would do something as monstrous as murder his friend in cold blood. In that regard, Geno McDermotts documentary (produced by Yahoo Sports Dan Wetzel and New York Daily News Kevin Armstrong) falls a bit short. It dispenses considerable persuasive conjecture about the multiple reasons that might have led Hernandez down this dark path, which ended in suicide (possibly instigated by use of synthetic marijuana K2) on April 19, 2017, shortly after he was acquitted in a separate double-homicide case involving a 2012 shooting. But it offers few definitive conclusions.

That said, one gets a sense from this compelling (albeit slight) documentary that there might be no single answer to its central question. Instead, it proffers the chilling idea that some puzzles are unsolvable, and that some hearts of darkness are, in the end, unknowable.

My Perfect Worlds most significant shortcoming is one of access. It features scant NFL game footage from Hernandezs career, and what is seensuch as his touchdown catch in Super Bowl XLVIcomes via fans cell phone camera video. Dramatic recreations and aerial landscape imagery substitute for on-the-ground material. No one close to Hernandez during his later years or his case participates, which leaves his childhood buddy Stephen Ziogas, family friend Kristen St. John, and Wetzel and Armstrong to afford a window into his mind and murder trials. The only family member who speaks to McDermott is Hernandezs half-sister Sara Vasquez (who was fathered by Hernandezs dad Dennis during his wilder days), and she has very little to contribute other than telling us that Hernandez always wanted to feel that he wasnt alone. Consequently, the film often operates at a significant remove from the man, as if trying to dissect him from 50 yards away.

Despite that distance, however, McDermott provides a clear timeline of Hernandezs life, as well as insight into the tumultuous events that helped shape him into a budding superstarand, also, a killer. Born in Bristol, CT into a clan with football in its veins, Hernandez quickly established himself as a receiving threat of uncanny speed and agility for his size. Though both his beloved father Dennis and older brother DJ attended the University of Connecticut, Hernandez, in the wake of his fathers untimely death during a routine hernia operation, opted instead to flee his hometown and head to the University of Florida. Having already begun hanging with the wrong crowd in Bristol, Hernandez found himself at a school known for questionable player behavior. He became an All-American at Florida, but misconduct and multiple drug violations caused him to drop to the fourth round of the NFL draft, where he was selected by the New England Patriots.

As Ziogas opines, that was probably the worst landing spot for him, since despite the Patriots strict winning culture (led by quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick), being in New England meant proximity to the unsavory types Hernandez had fallen in with years earlier. What followed was bad news all around. In 2012, Hernandez supposedly got into an altercation over a spilled drink with Daniel de Abreu at a Boston nightclub, and responded by shooting up de Abreus car at a traffic stop, killing him and Safiro Furtado (and wounding three others). While hed eventually be found innocent of those charges, My Perfect World contends that paranoia about being arrested for that drive-by soon consumed Hernandez, leading him to shoot drug- and gun-dealing best friend Alexander Bradley in the face in 2013 (resulting in Barkley losing an eye and part of a finger). And it also drove him, in 2013, to lure Lloydthe boyfriend of Shaneah Jenkins, who was the sister of Hernandezs fiancee Shayanna (whom he later married)out to an abandoned industrial park with two accomplices, and put multiple fatal bullets in him.

Were these crimes the byproduct of Hernandezs anger over his fathers death? The negative influence of the nasty company he kept? An American athletic culture that coddled talented prospects to the point of making them entitled man-children without any sense of responsibility? The CTE-causing head injuries that so many NFL players suffer? Or was it, simply, that Hernandez was a tough guy who thought himself a gangster, and thought he could get away with anythinga notion further suggested by the fact that prison guards and officials report that, upon being incarcerated in Souza-Baranowski Correctional Facility, Hernandez immediately took to prison life, replete with tattoos that suggested he was a member of the Bloods? McDermotts film ultimately argues that it was all of those things, even as it leaves the impression that Hernandezs true motivations may never quite be understood.

After watching My Perfect Worlds trial clips, news reports and newly recorded interviews, that inconclusive assessment may frustrate some viewers. Yet in the end, it also feels close to the most honest answer available. And, because of that, it leaves one with far more unsettling notions to ponderthat fame and fortune arent cures for inner torment; that death can strike at any moment, from any random direction; and that even the most high-profile people in the world are ultimately mysteries to us and, perhaps, to those closest to them as well."
2018-07-25,Daily Beast,Pompeo Trumps Tough on Russia if You Dont Listen to His Words,"In the aftermath of Donald Trumps supine performance before Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a key Senate panel that the American president is actually tough on Russia, provided observers disregard what he actually says.

Its a stance that could come back to hurt one of Trumps closest advisers, and three hours into an extraordinarily contentious hearing, Pompeo opted to dial it back.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had summoned Pompeo on Wednesday to find out what Trump actually discussed with Putin, solo and without witnesses, and what, if anything Trump agreed to. Trump and his White House mouthpieces have discussed the meeting in generic terms. Trump said in Helsinki that he and Putin had discussed Syria at length, as well as Ukraine and bilateral arms-control accords, but it remains unknown if Trump made any specific commitments to his Russian counterpart.

Russian officials, with evident relish, have stepped into that vacuum and implied that Trump made promises they expect him to keep. A spokesman for the Russian military looked forward to practical implementation of the agreements the day after the Helsinki summit. The following day, Russias ambassador to Washington said Putin and Trump had made important verbal agreements, particularly concerning Syria. The senior U.S. general responsible for the Middle East, Joe Votel, told Pentagon reporters on Thursday that there was no new guidance for me as the result of the Helsinki discussion.

But Pompeo, at turns dismissive and smug to his oversight committee, made it clear he wasnt there to shed light on what Trump and Putin discussed alone. The president has a prerogative to choose whos in meetings, he shot back to the panels top Democrat, Robert Menendez of New Jersey. When Menendez pressed him on any commitment Trump made to relaxing sanctions, Pompeo subtly shifted the subject to say no commitment has been made to change policies and said he saw the game Menendez was playing.

It went on like that for three hours. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, cited the Russian defense ministrys description and the Pentagons information vacuum. I will humbly suggest you have more confidence in statements from General Votel than the Russian ministry of defense, Pompeo responded. After Arizona Republican Jeff Flake raised a similar point about the lack of a verifiable record of the conversation, Pompeo retorted, I know youve had private conversations in your life and you valued them.

Pompeo showed up to the hearing armed with what he called the Crimea Declaration, and he seemed to view it as a rhetorical checkmate. Before the hearing began, Pompeo put out a statement refusing to ever recognize Russias nearly four-year occupation of the peninsula. Moscow acted in a manner unworthy of a great nation, the declaration reads. Pompeo referred to it frequently throughout the hearing, referring to how the White House cleared it. The implication was that Pompeos rebuke of Russia was more important than anything Trump himself said in Helsinki.

Pompeo kept it up for three hours. Every time a senator expressed alarm over the mysterious solo Trump-Putin meeting, Pompeo ratcheted off a list of Russian diplomats the administration expelled, oligarchs and institutions placed under sanctions or aspects of the U.S. nuclear arsenal the administration has bolstered. The policies, Pompeo told Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy, are indeed the most important statements.

The problem is that Trump sanctioned Russia with extreme reluctance and belated implementation. Indeed, the sanctions Pompeo claimed credit for, known as CAATSA, were congressional creations to hedge against Trump giving the store away to Putin. Senators were quick to read back Trumps CAATSA signing statement that the bill was significantly flawed. It got to the point where Pompeo had to aver that he was willing to entertain new sanctions on Russia.

It all got to be too much for the panels Republican chairman, the retiring Bob Corker of Tennessee, who called Trump a pushover in Helsinki. Corker praised Pompeos service to the heavens before telling him to cut the bull. Creating an equivalence between our intelligence agencies and what Putin is saying, Corker said, shocks people, as does Trumps willingness to entertain the idea of Russian interrogations of U.S. diplomats.

To purposefully cause the American people to misunderstand about the NATO contributions and to cause them to doubt NATO and really drive public opinion against NATO, that to me was purposeful, not unlike what happened after Charlottesville, Corker said. Why does he do those things, is there some strategy behind creating doubt in U.S. Senators minds on both sides of the aisle, doubt in the American people as to what his motivations are?

Pompeo denied any such thing was happening. You somehow disconnect the administrations activities from the presidents actions, Pompeo said, acting wounded.

I know what were doing. Talk to the points I just made, Corker said.

Heres what the world needs to know with respect to Russia. This administrations been tougher than previous administrations, Pompeo replied. I think I can prove thats the case today. I think I have. Somehow theres this idea this administration is free-floating. This is President Trumps administration.

Corker didnt really dignify that. You handle yourself in exactly the way you should in my opinion, as it relates to comments. I notice you are not responding to what Im saying. ... You just didnt, OK?

Pompeos insistence that Senators disbelieve the evidence of their senses wore out most senators, particularly Democrats, who didnt have the stomach to flatly call the secretary of state a liar. But his vigor in spinning might have created Pompeo some problems by suggesting that the logorrheic, Twitter-addicted presidents words werent statements of U.S. policy, a position he walked back later in the hearing.

Pompeo, again confronting Menendez, effectively revised and extended his own remarks. I misspoke. It is the case that the president calls the ball. His statements are in fact policy. But its the case that when all of us speak in informal settings, in response to questions, were not covering the full gamut of things that impact the world. Thats what I intended to say, Pompeo said. I saw the glee on your side walking away, trying to make a political point from that. Thats silliness. This president runs this government.

It was the only substantial terrain Pompeo ceded in a combative performance atypical for a secretary of state. And it may reflect a shift in power dynamics within the administration

After Helsinki, Trump tapped the White House-based National Security Council to be the point of contact for follow-ups with the Russians  not the State Department. Right before Pompeo testified, the national security adviser, John Bolton, had covered for Trumps unrequited invitation for Putin to visit Washington by saying it would have to await the conclusion of special prosecutor Robert Muellers Russia witch hunt, which he implied would be after January.

Those are the sorts of words Trump finds most pleasing of all: echoes of his own."
2018-02-09,Daily Beast,The Shocking Case of the All-American Jock and the Dead Punk Rocker,"Its difficult not to feel a bit nauseated while watching Bomb City.

The true story upon which the film is based is a prime example of the failures of the American justice system as well as the politics of appearances, and is an uncomfortable reminder of how little progress has been made in the last few decades.

Twenty years ago in Amarillo, Texas, tensions between local punks and jocks reached a head. During a confrontation, 17-year-old jock Dustin Camp killed 19-year-old punk musician Brian Deneke in a deliberate hit-and-run attack. Though he was charged with murder, Camp was only found guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and was sentenced to probation and a fine of $10,000. The fine, as the film tells us, was eventually dropped. Its an obvious miscarriage of justice, especially given the eyewitness testimony that Camp yelled, Im a ninja in my Caddy, before hitting Deneke, and then, I bet he liked that one, after running him over.

The details of the trial are no easier to stomach. Warren L. Clark, Camps defense attorney, painted the punks as violent thugs on the basis of their appearances, and emphasized Camps image as a wholesome, clean-cut all-American teen. In the film, Clarkrenamed as Cameron Wilson and played by Glenn Morshowerbegs the jury to consider the fact that Camp has his whole life ahead of him, which is a tactic viewers may recognize from cases such as that of Brock Turner (i.e., cases involving white men, especially those who come from a background of privilege).

The film ends with Marilyn Mansons post-Columbine speech, in which the shock rocker notes that Deneke was killed once by Camp, and then killed again by the trial, which essentially argued that he deserved to die because of the way he looked. In the face of that assessment, Bomb City seems to want to grant Deneke a second life.

Under the direction of Jameson Brooks, the film is impressively even-handed. Theres no equivocating aside from the arguments of the defense attorney, and a sense of unease is sustained through the entire film via muted visuals and an impressively spare score (written by Cody and Sheldon Chick). Bomb City benefits from that barebones approach, especially given the seriousness of the subject matter. It also begs its audience to challenge whatever preconceptions about appearance they may have, opening with Wilsons run-down of Denekes clothes making him out as a menace.

The action switches back and forth from the punks to the jocksand to the trial, which is cut in throughout. We see Deneke (played affectingly by Dave Davis) struggle with his insecurities as to his future, just as we see Camp (renamed Cody Cates and played by Luke Shelton) grow resentful of his peers as he tries to fit in; hes more openly aggressive than Deneke, going out of his way to provoke the punks he comes across. It all highlights how judging these people by their looks has always been an inherently flawed metric. If anything, the difference between these people is in the resources they have at their disposal, whether its money or public perception.

With that in mind, its almost chilling when the final confrontation takes place. The image of all of the jocks gathered in one place is reminiscent of the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally of last year, in which white supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis gathered to display their hate. The rally soon became violent, with 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. driving his car into a group of counterprotesters, killing one, Heather Heyer, and injuring 19 others. Many of the images from the rally are of young white men cut in Camps mold, and much of the criticism of the handling of the rally has been of leniency based on the fact that the gathered protesters were white.

Race doesnt really play a part in Bomb City insomuch as the incident was instigated by and affected white people, but theres still a relevant point to be made in that privilege can seriously tip the scales when it comes to who can get away with what. The films portrayal of police brutality touches upon that as well: When the punks are apprehended for graffiti, the cops use undue force to subdue them, including forcing the barrel of a gun into a girls mouth and spraying the boys with hoses. But when it comes to the jocks, the cops break up a bonfire party (complete with underage drinking) by just telling the kids to go home. In Cates words, We run this town.

Despite taking place two decades ago, Bomb City doesnt feel like old news; if anything, its an even thornier issue now. The mindset that essentially acquitted Camp of murdernot to mention President Trumps very fine people on both sides rhetorichas yet to be retired. To that end, the film serves not only to shed light on Denekes case but to prompt further conversation as to the imbalance thats still so prevalent today."
2018-11-20,Daily Beast,Tijuana Locals Assault Caravan Migrants Threaten to Rip Them From Shelter,"TIJUANA, MexicoA dowsing with hot coffee, a sucker punch, angry threats, peltings with sticks and stones.

Migrants who have journeyed from Central America to this border city seeking refuge from violence back home have encountered unexpected violence and harassment here. More than 3,000 migrants have arrived in Tijuana since Wednesdaya rate of arrival that city officials say is without precedent in the history of the city known as the City of Migrants. The migrants formed part of the Central American caravan seeking political asylum in the U.S.

The caravans highly publicized arrival has generated a nationalist backlash from a segment of residents here that views the migrants as a threat to public safety, and as unwanted competition for jobs and public services.

It has led to a kind of siege mentality inside the emergency shelter where they have taken refuge.

The first sign of violence was on Wednesday night when a crowd of angry residents from an affluent coastal part of the city known as Playas de Tijuana confronted migrants who had gathered there to spend the night at a local park.

They said we snored and that we stink and about 20 of them threw stones at us, said 14-year-old Lineth Viera, from Honduras, who was at Playas that night with her father and brother.

Children account for approximately 21 percent of the migrants in Tijuana, according to a city official who oversees data from the shelters registry.

Two construction workers from Honduras who traveled together in the caravan told me that a woman in the crowd at Playas threw hot coffee at them from a thermos.

Seven migrants were arrested on charges of public disorder, including several for reportedly smoking marijuana on the beach. Videos of the melee went viral.

In response to the disorder, the city converted a municipal sports complex near downtown to an emergency shelter where the migrants could gather together at one location. For days police have blocked all road access to the shelter and maintained a 24-hour security detail in the area. Migrants say it hasnt stopped the violent attacks against them.

On Friday at around 8 p.m., a local man sucker-punched a migrant who was standing in a line for humanitarian aid outside the shelter, according several migrants who were in the area at the time.

The man had been drinking, he told us we werent wanted here. Then punched the man in the face, said Marvin Guevara, a 26-year-old Honduran who said he was standing in the line near the man at the time.

Migrants said police intervened and removed the man from the area. A senior police official said no arrests have been made outside the shelter.

Migrants say that opponents of the caravan harassed and threatened them into early Saturday morning. At around 1 a.m. migrants say a group of assailants threatened them from the fence of a baseball park inside the sports complex where the migrants were camped for the night. There were small children sleeping in the area. No city official confirmed the account, though migrants said police intervened and prevented the alleged assailants from throwing rocks.

Police did confirm that in a separate incident, a group shouted threats and pelted the metal roof of the gymnasium with what one migrant from Honduras described as sticks and stones. There were no arrests, and the matter remains under investigation, the police official said.

We didnt sleep all night because we were scared theyd come back, said Karen Antunes, a Honduran woman who is staying at the shelter in Tijuana with her 11-year-old son.

Antunes fled Honduras a month ago fearing retaliation for the government after taking part in a nationwide wave of protests following allegations of voter fraud in the election of President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

She compared the feeling inside the complex to un asedio, (a siege).

On Sunday, anti-caravan protesters clashed with riot police near the shelter, vowing to sacar los migrantes de alli (get the migrants out of there). Migrants at the shelter were kept on lockdown for hours while protesters overturned concrete barriers put in place for crowd control and threw plastic bottles and trash at a helmeted line of police with riot shields.

Protesters decried the migrants as invaders and ingrates. Behind the police lines, migrants were restricted from leaving the shelter. Dozens of them huddled inside a fence.

There is no water to drink, said Josue Ayala, a 37-year-old agronomist from El Salvador.

We havent eaten since yesterday, said Jose Reyes, a 30-year-old farm laborer from Honduras.

When a man who lives in the neighborhood brought a case of mineral water to the fence, the migrants swarmed and the water bottles were gone in seconds.

Police have barred the delivery of humanitarian supplies inside the gates of the shelter, especially food. City officials point to threats made on Facebook to poison the migrants food as reason for the precaution. Migrants must leave the shelter to receive food from churches, volunteers, and other charities.

The more aggressive the protests and harassment, they say, the more tightly police restrict movement in and out of the shelter. And the citys supply of food and water at the shelter is inadequate to meet the growing need.

There is no food, no toilet paper, no water, no blankets, said Gladys Cardoza, a 39-year-old from Honduras who is traveling with her teenage son. Weve had to go out in the street and rely on good Samaritans for help.

Among the migrants who sleep at night in the outfield of the baseball park, many have no tent, tarp, or other form of shelter. They sleep in the open air on camp mattresses or a blanket. Low temperatures at night are forecast to dip into the 40s this week, with a likelihood of rain on Thursday.

Cesar Palencia, the city official who is heading the relief effort, said the city is heading up the effort with zero assistance from the federal government. We will continue to do all we can, he said.

On Monday, city officials who oversee the shelter started a new process that allows bottles of water and other non-perishable goods into the shelter after a review by officials. Palencia said the city has also begun a process to allow prepared food into the shelter. A medical tent from the state health department was also performing health checkups.

Migrants told The Daily Beast that conditions inside the shelter have improved significantly since anti-immigrant protests that made international news concluded on Sunday evening. City officials are, however, closely enforcing previous limits on press access to the shelter, restricting reporters to one hour of access in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Palencia acknowledged the existence of what he called ill will against the migrants and said city officials have asked them to remain calm and not harm the migrants.

Public resentment against the migrants has been fueled in part by comments from Tijuanas mayor, Jose Manuel Gastelum, who accused migrants in the caravan of being violent, crude, and mariguanos (stoners). Gastelum vowed to conduct an inquiry to decide if the city will continue to welcome them.

Gastelum said the city may not have the resources to continue to shelter and support the caravan. President Trump in a tweet likened Gastelums concerns about the caravan to the presidents own.

But migrants sheltered at the sports complex in Tijuana say the city is sending a mixed message and that the protection they are receiving feels to them at times more like a quarantine.

Dire fears are gaining traction in the shelter that protesters will force their way into the shelter and remove the migrants by force.

Reyes, the farm laborer from Honduras, says it feels as though the entire city is against them.

We dont feel safe in here, Reyes said through the bars in the fence. It seems like they want to provoke a confrontation, and there are many women and children in here."
2018-08-04,Daily Beast,Think 3D-Printed Guns Are Scary Get A Load Of This,"Last month the Trump administration cleared online gun group Defense Distributed to begin offering to the public downloadable instructions for undetectable, untraceable 3D-printed guns starting at midnight on Aug. 1.

Despite widespread outcry, Congress failed to halt the downloads. Florida senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, scrambled to pass a last-minute ban, but Sen. Mike Lee  a Utah Republican  blocked Nelson's effort.

Compare the inaction with the last time an upstart company tried to distribute undetectable guns. In 1987, Florida firm Red Eye Arms mentioned that it might develop a plastic gun for the civilian market.

Within a year, lawmakers passed the Undetectable Firearms Act, which requires all firearms sold in the United States to contain some metal components so that, in theory, they show up on metal detectors.

To the 100th Congress, the mere idea of plastic guns was enough to compel swift legislative action. Thirty years later, the 115th Congress faced actual rather than theoretical plastic guns ... and did nothing.

It's not hard to explain the difference. ""The simple answer is that Democrats had strong control of Congress back then and the Republicans are in charge today,"" John Donohue, an expert on gun laws at Stanford University, told The Daily Beast. ""The gun lobby has complete control over Republican politicians.""

Winter Park, Florida-based Red Eye Arms, which is no longer in business, was never a very serious enterprise. In late 1987 the tiny company  founded by gunsmith David Byron and his principal backer John Floren, a funeral-home operator  got the U.S. Army to agree to at least look at a plastic grenade launcher the company said it was developing.

The grenade-launcher scheme went nowhere. But taking advantage of the resulting press coverage, Red Eye Arms pivoted to a new idea  a lightweight, durable, nearly-recoilless plastic handgun for the civilian market. ""I'm convinced that, ultimately, we'll replace every weapon on Earth,"" Red Eye vice president Dwight Brunoehler told Inc. magazine.

Like the grenade launcher, Red Eye's plastic-gun scheme went nowhere. The technology just wasn't up to snuff. ""I have seen proposals, spiels and graphics,"" Ed Ezell, a firearms expert at the Smithsonian Institution, told The Los Angeles Times . ""I have yet to see them produce any hardware. I don't think they've gone anywhere with this except around the promotion circuit.""

Democrats in Congress took no chances. Ohio senator Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. William Hughes of New Jersey sponsored a bill that would require guns to include at least 3.7 ounces of metal  enough to set off metal detectors. The Undetectable Firearms Act passed in October 1988. Pres. Ronald Reagan signed it into law that November.

Lawmakers knew they were banning what was, at the time, future technology. ""We're legislating against something that doesn't exist,"" H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for Sen. Jim McClure, an Idaho Republican, told Inc .

But Greg Eyring from the congressional Office of Technology Assessment told The Los Angeles Times that, with or without Red Eye, plastic guns were ""inevitable.""

The 1988 law remains in effect. Legal 3D-printed gun designs include metal firing pins and other small metal components in order to comply with the law, although critics warn that carriers can easily remove these parts in order to sneak plastic weapons past metal detectors.

The Undetectable Firearms Act doesnt address 3D-printed guns' lack of traceable serial numbers or the ability of makers to skirt background checks. In 1988, forward-thinking lawmakers anticipated plastic guns becoming a problem. But they didn't anticipate the 3D-printing technology that would turn the concept of plastic guns into reality.

Nor, apparently, did they foresee a Republican administration giving the go-ahead for a company to make plastic guns accessible to the public. And a Republican Congress doing nothing to stop it.

As the Aug. 1 start of legal gun-downloads approached, Democratic attorneys general from eight states sued. A federal judge in Seattle quickly issued an injunction against Defense Distributed ahead of an Aug. 10 hearing that could decide the future of untraceable, undetectable guns.

But as long as Republicans hold at least one chamber in Congress, neither a new ban on 3D-printed guns nor an expansion of the 1988 law seems likely.

The Obama administration had effectively blocked 3D-printed guns. The Trump Justice Department, by contrast, ""really messed up on this,"" Donohue told The Daily Beast. ""Congress could presumably immediately implement the Obama plan and prevent this lunacy. Federal action is always best, but that just may not be possible here."""
2018-09-10,Daily Beast,New Yorks Million-Dollar Madam Is Back Behind Bars,"Old madams never really retire; they just give the occasional piece of advice to working girls when theyre hanging out in their old pals (alleged) brothels.

Or thats what 61-year-old grandmother Julie Moya told me when I visited her at Rikers Island earlier this month. Moya has been behind bars since June, her first time locked up since finishing a nearly two-year sentence in 2007 for running what Manhattan prosecutors had described as a $3 million-per-year prostitution ring.

I dont understand it,Moya said of her new travails in a half-hour interview from Rikers lockup for women, the Rose M. Singer Center.

Just after her last release, the Ohio native had told a Daily News reporter that she had been married at 13, had her first child at 14, and then remarried an Argentine drug kingpin whod saved her from working as a prostitute before she was 25.

Then she was arrested in the 1990s while delivering three kilos of cocaine to an East Harlem bodega owner. After cooperating with law enforcement, Moya said, she was sentenced to five years probation.

Drugs kill people, she says a DEA agent told her. Why dont you do something harmless, like run a brothel?

So the mother-of-three returned to sex work, this time taking a cut from other womens flesh.

Ten years and eight figures later, Moya had women working out of five Midtown apartments and her home on Long Island, catering to a clientele that she said included cops, lawyers, doctors and a notable music producer who pulled a gun on a couple of girls a few times"" while high.

While Moya was widely referred to as New Yorks friendliest madamand the madam with a heart because she had long taken in stray animalsauthorities also alleged her sex ring used children, including a 15-year-old girl, reports indicate.

The main prosecutor on Moyas case,  Matthew Bassiur, even claimed in court that she would bring minors into her brothels in order to take their virginityand get them into prostitution, according to the New York Post.   That charge was dropped in Moyas plea deal.

I miss my brothels, Moya had lamented just after she was sprung in 2007. I miss my girls. I miss my life.

She didnt miss it for long, if the Manhattan District Attorneys Office is to be believed.

Moyawho describes herself on a Twitter account, last updated in 2012, as a ""Former NYC madam living in NYC doing things differently, trying to shed the rep that media portrayed""was collared on June 28 on a new charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree, for her alleged involvement running girls again through most of her decade of freedom.

The defendants, in the County of New York and elsewhere, during the period from on or about May 1, 2008 to on or about June 27, 2018, knowingly advanced and profited from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and owning, alone and in association with others, a house of prostitution and a prostitution business and enterprise involving prostitution activity by two or more persons in prostitution, read the Manhattan Supreme Court indictment against Moya and six others.

The indictment also charged Moya and her co-defendants with conspiracy in the fifth degree, claiming they agreed with each other and others to engage in and cause the performance of such conduct.

The indictment includes a trail of digital evidence, including emails alleged to have been swapped over this 10-year period.

Pimpin aint easy but it sure is fun, read the subject line of one email Moya allegedly sent on May 16, 2008.

This is Julie Moya... I am back in the biz but very low key, call me anytime, Moya wrote in that email, according to the indictment.

In December of the following year, Moya allegedly sent another email asking to post an ad on an adult website, www.bestgfe.com, writing I am an agency offering the same services to others... 

In the email , Moya allegedly noted that the admins were concerned that I may draw LE (law enforcement) to your site... 

As time went on, Moyas involvement in the sex industry deepened, court papers charge. Her email address was used to register the domain www.jewels-nyc.com in March 2012. A phone number belonging to another one of Moyas co-defendants, Daniel Colon, was used to register this website, charging documents state.

Colon placed an ad on Backpage.com in February 2013 that read Agency of your DREAMS hiring now.

Im urgently seeking classy, cute girl-next-door or model-type females to join me in opening an all-new escort agency that caters to YOU, stated the ad.

That June, Colon opened a ConEd account for 645 Broadwaythe location of one their brick-and-mortar brothels.

While Moya was locked up at Rikers this time, her brothel dancing partner and friend of two decades, 68-year-old William Merseya former cabbie better known in the citys sex industry as the eponymous proprietor of Dollar Bills Psycho Roundup (All the nudes fit to print!), and an avid blogger and occasional writer for the Daily News and the Village Voicespent a week behind bars in the same case.

Mersey used to to handle escorts advertising, selling their ads in bulk to adult publications and alt-weekliesuntil the feds closed in and went after him, not for the sex ads he middle-manned but for evading $3.5 million in taxes from the cash he collected for those ads.

While Mersey awaits sentencing on the tax rap, which he pleaded guilty to, he found himself named as a defendant in Moyas latest case.

His alleged involvement in her brothel business appears to stem from a single email he sent to Moya on August 10, 2015: The following are Jewels page view from march through July....Assuming your revenue mirrors page view loss, you lost 14% when you lost me....At $100 per guy and 14% loss, you lost $1400 per day x 26 day month = 36,000 per month....Ya know....you could come back on [my] site...hire me to take pix, build pages, and clean up that fucking mess of a Jewels blog.

Mersey also bought a domain, www.gentlemanschoice-ny.com, in June 2017, which prosecutors claim was tied to Moyas businesses.

For that, Mersey was taken into custody on July 5 and spent a week in The Tombs, a city-run jail in Downtown Manhattan, while waiting for his $50,000 surety bond to go through.

The state felt that I was part of a conspiracy to promote prostitution, Mersey said of the new charges hes facing, which he denies. In actuality, Ive been friends with this woman ever since I sold her an ad in 1997.

Imagine if you had a boyfriend who you were mailing back and forth withyou know youre a son-of-a-bitch, you cheated on me, and the feds are reading this? Mersey continued. Not a comfortable feeling.

It seems counterproductive to incarcerate a 68-year-old white man, who volunteers daily at soup kitchens and churches when he didnt hurt anybodyand hes paid his tax bill, Mersey said. I did not promote prostitution, unequivocally.

Moya remains on Rikers Island, evidently unable to post her $75,000 bail or even land a $100,000 bond.

Despite her drab surroundings, Moya beamed when a reporter mentioned Merseys name.

Hes innocent, she said through a telephone handset, while seated behind a glass barrier.

Her tone and appearance lacked the braggadocio of the madam who in 2005 told reporters her brothels were the friendliest, the nicest, the best"" in New York Cityand who reportedly sported stiletto boots when surrendering to cops in that bust.

Moya told The Daily Beast that she and Mersey were close friends and that the two had indeed been to the loft on Bleecker at Broadwayone of the locations alleged to be a brothel in this indictment.

But they just hung out there, she said, listening to music, sometimes dancing.  There wasnt any illegal activity taking place when she and Mersey were there, Moya maintains.

Moya reiterated her supposed innocence, and said her relationship with the sex industry these days was, at most, giving pointers to participants.

She hopes to get out while her case is pending so she can take of her 12-year-old grandson at her home in Whitestone, Queens. (The boy, whose father is Moyas son and co-defendant, Jerry Morgan, is now being cared for by her other son, who lives out of state.)

Despite her past reputationthe New York Post estimated she kept about 50 percent of her prostitutes fees, some $15 million over a decadeIm not the big madam, Moya said."
2018-08-17,Daily Beast,Stephen Colbert Roasts Lara Trump for Omarosa Tape Send My Worst Sons Wife,"Do you ever think maybe it wasnt worth firing somebody? Stephen Colbert asked in his monologue Thursday night. Because President Trump has gotta be thinking that about Omarosa.

Omarosa Manigault Newmans Unhinged book tour rolled on today with the release of yet another secretly-recorded tape, this one featuring the voice of Lara Trump, wife of Eric, who can be heard offering the fired Trump aide $15,000 a month for a job in which part of the deal would require staying positive about the president. In an interview with MSNBC Thursday, Omarosa described the offer as an attempt to buy my silence, to censor me, and to pay me off.

But after listening to the tape, Colbert really only had one question: Why is Lara Trump in charge of this?

Imitating President Trump, the Late Show host said, Look, super important meeting, everybody come here. We cant have Omarosa spilling sensitive info that could destroy my presidency. We need someone to handle this delicately. Send my worst sons wife.

Meanwhile, Omarosa has said she has many more tapes of Trump officials that she is saving to share when the time is right. As Colbert prepares to take a two-week hiatus from his show, he implored her, I can tell you exactly when the time is right: two weeks from now when Im back from vacation. Not a moment before.

During that same interview, Omarosa appeared to intentionally slip and refer to Trump at one point as Mr. Nixon. In response, Colbert said, That is an insult... to Richard Nixon."
2018-09-11,Daily Beast,10 Dishes With Chef Chris Shea,"After a shift, what is your favorite guilty pleasure to eat? My old go-to after a shift was an ice cream sundae. Nowadays, I make a sundae out of sheeps milk yogurt, maple syrup, berries, almonds and whipped coconut milk. Its the best.

Is there one dish you wont cook? When you start out, you cook what you are told to cook and how to cook it (and for good reason). Having an open mind leads to great discoveries, so there really isnt anything I wont try at least once.

All-time favorite spice. Mace. It will kick up your apple pie or put your fried chicken over the top.

What is your favorite music to listen to while you cook? At work, I prefer not to have the music on. I like the sounds of the kitchen and I like to hear whats going on. At home, however, I listen to Iron Maiden or Slayer.

Did you grow up cooking as a child? I actually started cooking as a teenager after watching an infomercial about woks and I pestered my mom to go to Chinatown and get me one!

What cookbook is your go-to resource for inspiration? I have hundreds of books I look at, but most recently I have been drawn to diet books. (I need to keep my cholesterol low.) Books by Chris Kresser and Dr. Loren Cordain have caught my eye.

After all these years working in restaurants, do you still enjoy going out to eat? I dont get to eat out as much as I would like, since I now have kids, but going out to dinner with my wife is my favorite thing to do. In a restaurant, Im trying to learn something about food or service and there is no greater joy than being served a well-executed dish knowing all that went into it.

Is there one chef youd like to cook with? Jean-Louis Palladin.

Name the all-time best cooking show. Its a tie between the Galloping Gourmet and the Essence of Emeril.

What is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when youre traveling for business? A Sharpie.

Chris Shea is the executive chef at New Yorks The Wayfarer.

2018-10-23,Daily Beast,House Swapping Can Be a Tourists Dream or Nightmare,"Who wouldnt want to spend a week or two in a country house in France, or a swank apartment in Florence, or even a cool studio in Bushwick? Especially when all you have to pay for is the airfare. The catch? The owners of those homes will sleep in your bed and eat on your plates while youre using theirs. You may not have the amenities you have become used to. You may have to talk to people you dont know.

How all that feels may tell you more about yourself than you think.

House swapping is definitely a trend in tourism. Websites are popping up all over, offering everything from financial savings to romance. (Think of us as online dating for home swapping, says Ben Wosskow, managing editor of lovehomeswap.com.) But do bear in mind the advice offered by those who have done the swap, and enjoyed it: Do not do this if you are a germophobe or likely to flip out if the internet is shaky or if you need the comfort of... well, comfort.

I always tell people that if they typically check into hotels and start complaining, and asking to upgrade, this is not for you, says Marilyn Bethany, who has been swapping her house in upstate New York for apartments, mostly in Brooklyn, for years.

Dan Flynn, who has swapped a New York apartment for homes in Europe at least eight times, seconds that thought: We are very loosey-goosey, he says. My wife found a scorpion in a bed the first night at one place, which might have sent others home. And if you dont want people touching your stuff, dont do this.

While it may force you to wonder how truly open, tolerant, and curious you are as a traveler, there is little doubt that interest in home swapping is growing. Besides lovehomeswap, there is now Kidandco.com (more family-oriented) and itravex.com. Those, and others, are basically playing catch up with the pre-eminent service called HomeExchange.com. It remains the one where most folks try out the concept of staying in someone elses home while they take over yours.

Many point to The Holiday, the rom-com starring Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz, as originally sparking interest in this idea. (No, Jude Law does not come with most offers.) I spoke with a variety of swappers and the large majority have had positive experiences. We basically spent a decade hitting every corner of France, says Flynn. Weve never had one bad experience, adds Bethany. She and her husband have discovered Dumbo and, currently, Ditmas Park, where they are enjoying a 15-room mansion while the owners are picking up their children in camp. Who knew Brooklyn had a neighborhood filled with Edith Wharton-type houses? she said excitedly. The other family looks forward to Marilyns forested getaway near the town of Hudson, New York.

With HomeExchange, potential swappers sign up with an annual fee (about $150) and then are basically on their own. They describe their own property, with photos, and then wait for the response. The most desired places in this country are, not surprisingly, New York, California, and Florida. We were staying in a four-bedroom farm house in France in exchange for our small apartment in New York, marvels Flynn.

Ideally, the swaps can happen simultaneously, but the truth is, most do not. (A balloon agreement allows the flipping owners to pick their convenient times.) Owners communicate with each other on all the details, and then they have to decide what to do with the time when someone else is living in their home.

And that is where swappers discover they are not always thrilled. Veronica and Martin (who did not want their last names used) swapped their New York townhouse for a place in Tuscany this summer, and, at this point, claim they wouldnt do it again. They felt the town was not as charming as advertised, but mostly it was the pain on the other end, as in their own address. Our daughter hated the idea of someone being in her room and having to find somewhere else to go for two weeks, says Veronica. Not to mention knowing her hairbrush and other items had been used.

I remember my parents having issues with getting people to take care of our house, says Anne-Fleur Andrie , a startup exec in Boston, whose family swapped numerous times. Especially with regards to cleaning. My mom made a point of not leaving the footprint of a large family, but that vision was not always shared with everyone.

There are always learning moments and occasional annoyances, agrees Kaylie Lewell , a New Zealander living in this country now. I had one issue with getting the keys too late, which made me anxious. So now I make sure we have phone numbers, emails, and alternate contacts. She took a place in Copenhagen when the owners were gone, and she visited Morocco when they visited her place.

Yes, we are talking travel habits here, but we are also talking about places where we live, raise our children, possibly were raised ourselves. So it is understandable that swappers may have conflicted feelings. Our homes often reflect aspects of our personality, like neatness, sociability, warmth, says New York psychologist Dr. Vivian Diller. So while swapping home can be fun, it can also reveal those characteristics we take for granted. For example, homes with cozy, small rooms often suit people who enjoy their privacy and quiet hobbies, like reading by a fireplace, small gatherings, intimate conversation. If you're used to living in an open space with big rooms and windows, that cozy house can feel claustrophobic. We also set up our homes to fit our unique needs. A coffee table strewn with magazines, books and games can feel inviting to one person, but to another it feels like clutter.

Clearly, this is not the travel choice of the one-percenters, who will probably be more satisfied renting that villa, getting the top suite in a Four Seasons, or hopping a yacht without having to share anything with anyone. And they may, lets face it, be more comfortable around others who feel the same way. For those on a budget, however, swapping is usually a way to save money. Kidandco.com promises a family-friendly way to save an average $2,500 for a seven-night stay.

Michael Rubin, who with his wife, swapped for a house in Puglia recently, is not convinced the financials always even out. While their house was being filled with a family of seven, they took a driving trip through Maine. Between paying for nice places to stay and a rental car, I am not sure we can call it a deal, he says.

Mostly, it is about what kind of traveler you are: do you prefer a private guide for a day filled with the kind of laborious details guides have clearly memorized? Or are you eager to experience how others live? Teens may hate the idea of strangers sleeping in their beds, but many later recall these experiences as idyllic and say they encouraged a love of immersive travel. My parents swapped a lot and it was mostly great for us as kids, says Andrie . Hotels can be so sterile and this felt like an authentic way to discover another culture, without huge budgetary constraints.

Michael Rubin says his wife and daughter came home feeling like their home had been invaded, and while he concedes he would only do it simultaneously, I would absolutely do it again, and wed probably end up doing it better. Adds Dan Flynn: In the end, its just different staying in a home for a few weeks and getting familiar with the locals, the old couple who run the coffee place in the village."
2018-11-08,Daily Beast,Ron Helus Sheriffs Deputy Who Ran Straight Into Thousand Oaks Shooting Died a Hero,"A California sheriffs deputy, who was planning to retire from the force in the next year, raced directly into the mass shooting at a Thousand Oaks club on Wednesday night to try to stop the slaughter of a young crowd at a country-music dance.

As he burst into the Borderline Bar & Grill, Sgt. Ron Helus reportedly was faced with a barrage of gunfire. He was said to be hit multiple times by a gunman who has been identified as Ian Long.

The 29-year Ventura County Sheriffs Office veteran made it as far as the local hospital, but did not survive his injuries.

Sheriff Geoff Dean, who was a close friend of Helus, broke down as he explained what had just unfolded at an early-morning press conference outside Los Angeles.

Ron was a hardworking, dedicated sheriffs sergeant. He was totally committed, he gave his all and tonight, as I told his wife, he died a hero; he went into save lives, to save other people, he said. Theres just no way to describe this. It saddens us all and it tears at our hearts.

Helus was on the phone with his wife when the call about the shooting came in. Dean said his colleague had hung up saying: Hey, I gotta go handle a call. I love you. Ill talk to you later.

Helus, 54, who lived in Moorpark, California, was dreaming of retirement from the sheriffs office and going back to studying.

The firearms expert already had a masters degree from the University of Oklahoma and wrote on his LinkedIn page that he planned to pursue my doctorate degree in the near future.

When off-duty, he trained people to use firearms and instructed them for concealed-carry weapons permits and loved to get out into the woods for fishing trips, according to his Facebook page. The page is dominated by beautiful, rugged images of wildlife, mountaintops, and his only son.

On Wednesday night, the SWAT team veteran arrived on the scene of the shooting about two-and-a-half minutes after the first distress calls were made to authorities.

He got there at the same time as a California Highway Patrol officer, Sheriff Dean said. When they heard additional gunshots from inside the Borderline, where an 18 and over night was underway, it was Helus who plunged into the danger, leaving his colleague to secure the perimeter until backup units arrived.

By the time more law-enforcement officers arrived, it was too late for Helus and the 11 unarmed civilians who had been slain. Once inside, the additional officers also found the body of the gunman.

Dean said sheriffs, like so many police officers around the country, have been trained to immediately engage the target and to stop the shooting in the wake of the Columbine, Colorado, high-school shooting. There is no doubt they saved lives by going.

Around 1 p.m., Helus body was transported in a hearse from the hospital to the medical examiner's officer with a police escort. The White House lowered flags to half staff to honor him and the rest of the 11 people who were killed in the shooting."

2018-10-05,Daily Beast,Jason Van Dyke Found Guilty of Murdering Laquan McDonald,"Chicago Police officer Jason Van Dyke on Friday was found guilty of the second-degree murder of Laquan McDonald during an infamous Oct. 20, 2014 encounter.

He was additionally found guilty on all 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm. The officer, however, was found not-guilty on an official misconduct charge.

The long-awaited verdict came nearly four years to the day after graphic dashcam footage showed Van Dyke shooting the 17-year-old, sparking widespread protests across the country.

One year after the shooting, Van Dyke was charged with six counts of first-degree murder. He pled not guilty. Ahead of the trial, however, four murder counts were dropped against the Chicago cop, leaving one first-degree murder charge, the 16 aggravated battery counts, and one count of official misconduct. Prosecutors also announced to the jury during closing arguments that they would consider a second-degree murder charge.

The jury of eight women and four men viewed graphic autopsy images and the dashcam video, which showed the 40-year-old cop shooting McDonald 16 times in less than 14 seconds.

During the three-week trial, Van Dykes legal team argued that the officer was wrongly charged, and that he acted out  self defense during the incident, as McDonald was holding a folding knife at the time of the shooting.

One of his attorneys even suggested the black teenager was on a wild rampage the night he died, comparing his behavior to that of a villain in a horror movie. The infamous dashcam video, defense attorney Daniel Herbert said in his opening statement, doesnt tell the whole story.

Now the government wants you to look at just the videotape, that weve probably all seen hundreds of times. They want you to look at the final chapter without reading the rest of the book, Herbert told jurors, who also listened to 20 defense witnesses, including Van Dyke himself.

He added: Race had absolutely nothing to do with this, and there will be no evidence whatsoever to suggest race was a factor.

Special prosecutor Joseph McMahon disagreed, suggesting the shooting was, in fact, racial because Van Dyke saw a black boy who had the audacity to ignore the police and thus fired on him despite there being no threat to the officers life.

Were here today because the defendant shot Laquan McDonald 16 times when it was completely unnecessary. When the defendant started shooting, Laquan McDonald was walking toward a chain-link fence in a vacant lot, surrounded by five squad cars and 10 fully armed and protected Chicago police officers, McMahon said.

Prosecutors also argued the dashcam video proved inconsistencies in Van Dykes testimony and police reports, by showing that the teenager was not engaging with police, instead walking far awayas far two car laneswhen the bullets were fired.

Initial police reports determined that Van Dyke has fired his weapon out of self defense and recorded the shooting as justified. McDonald had been behaving erratically while walking down the street, the report claimed, and was holding a folding knife with a three-inch blade.

Two Chicago cops began pursuing McDonald after a truck driver called 911 that night, reporting someone was breaking into car in a truck yard. One cop began to follow McDonald by foot, and another joined in a police vehicle. After following McDonald for several blocks, the two officers waited for backup officers to arrive with a Taser.

In court, Officer Joseph McElligott said while they waited for back up, he never believed he or his partner were in danger.

We were trying to buy time to get a Taser, McElligott testified. We were just trying to be patient.

Soon after, Van Dyke and his partner arrived, along with the Chicago Police Taser unit.

From the moment [Van Dyke] gets out of his vehicle, six seconds later, he pulls his trigger for the first time and starts to shoot Laquan McDonald, McMahon said.

McDonald then fell to the ground less than two seconds after Van Dyke fired his weapon, McMahon told jurors.

In total, this defendant decides to shoot Laquan McDonald not once, not twice, but three, four, five, six, seven, eighthes only halfway donenine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 times, the attorney said.

In addition to massive city and country-wide protests, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired the city's police superintendent, and the U.S. Department of Justice opened an investigation into the Chicago Police Department, which ultimately revealed years worth of systemic civil-rights violations.

The report, which attributed these violations to poor training and supervision, found that the civilian communitys confidence in law enforcement had been broken."
2018-09-29,Daily Beast,A Sex Scandal Canceled the Nobel Prize for Literature this Year Should the Other Prizes Take a Brea,"By Brian Keating, Professor of Physics, University of California San Diego

If you ever meet someone who claims to have nearly won the Nobel Prize in mathematics, walk away: Youre dealing with a deeply delusional individual. While there isnt, and has never been, a Nobel in mathematics, the desire to claim Nobel-worthiness is sensible, for no matter the field, it is the worlds most prestigious accolade.

The annual prizes are Swedens most sacred holiday, bringing out royalty in the arts and sciences and a worldwide audience of millions to witness an event featuring the pomp and circumstance typically associated with the naming of a new pope. Indeed, the prizes are so important to Swedens national identity that the king of Sweden recently took the unprecedented step of  canceling the Nobel Prize in literature for 2018. What would cause King Gustaf to take such an extraordinary step? Simply put, he did so for the same reason that Alfred Nobel founded the awards to begin with: public relations.

Chemist and inventor  Alfred Nobel  was once called the merchant of death for his arms dealerships role in killing more people faster than ever before. To rehabilitate the Nobel name, Alfred created the eponymous prizes with a mission that the awards be for the benefit of mankind.

The 2013 Nobel Prize winners from left to right: Francois Englert, physics; Peter W. Higgs, physics; Martin Karplus, chemistry; Micheal Levitt, chemistry; Arieh Warshel, chemistry; James E. Rothman, medicine; Randy W. Schekman, medicine; Thomas C. Sudhof, medicine; Eugene F. Fama, economics; Lars Peter Hansen, economics; Robert J.Shiller, economics, at the Nobel Prize award ceremony, Dec. 10, 2013, in Stockholm, Sweden. TT, Fredrik Sandberg/AP Photo

King Gustaf wisely decided that the literature Nobel take a one-year hiatus to  investigate the allegations  of horrific sexual misconduct by a key member of the committee that awards the prize in literature. This stand-down period will hopefully also allow for a reevaluation of the process by which the prizes are awarded.

While the two science prizes, in chemistry and physics, have so far not succumbed to scandal, they have had their fair share of controversy. (See Habers chemistry Nobel for the invention of, and later advocacy for, chemical weapons.) Still, I believe it might behoove the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to take a year off as well.

As an astrophysicist and an invited nominator of Nobel laureates in years past, I have studied the prize and the organization that awards them. My investigations revealed a bevy of biases that still remain within the esteemed physics prize (my specialization). If it were to stay the course, I fear the prestige of the Nobel, and perhaps the publics perception of science itself, could be irreparably harmed.

The AGA lighthouse Blockhusudden, close to Stockholm, was set up in 1912. The lighthouse was driven by a sun valve that was invented by Nils Gustaf Dalen. The sun valve allowed the lighthouse to conserve fuel by turning on only at night. This lighthouse worked continuously on the sun valve until it was electrified in 1980.Photo by CEphoto, Uwe Aranas, CC BY-SA

To win sciences top prize an individual must meet three main criteria, according to Alfred Nobels will. First they must make the most important invention or discovery in physics or chemistry. Secondly, it should be made during the previous year. And the final requirement is that it benefits all of mankind. This last outcome is the most nebulous and subjective  and frequently violated. How can the degree of the worldwide beneficence of a scientific discovery be adequately judged?

For example, given the enormous stockpiles of nuclear weapons around the world, is nuclear fission, the winning achievement of the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry awarded to Otto Hahn, and not to his female collaborator Lise Meitner, of sufficient benefit to warrant a Nobel?

And what about the lobotomy? This discovery, rewarded with the 1949 Nobel Prize in physiology, caused widespread and disastrous outcomes until it was banned a decade later. Gustav Dalens lighthouse regulator, awarded the prize in 1912, didnt exactly enjoy the longevity of many subsequent prizes.

Even some recent prizes have raised eyebrows. Corruption charges brought up in 2008 threatened to sully the reputation of the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine after  drug company AstraZeneca allegedly influenced the selection of that years laureate  for its own gain.

This points to another issue with the prize: It can misrepresent the way science is done. Science is a team sport, and no one truly goes to Stockholm alone. Yet the  current restriction  to at most three laureates distorts the perception of science by reinforcing the laypersons impression that science is done by lone geniuses  typically white, American males  working without vast support networks behind them.

And what if, in contrast to these scientific innovations, the Nobel Prize itself harms rather than helps mankind, or at least the slice of it devoted to the sciences?

While its true that Nobels titular prize bequeathed a fortune to scientists, activists, physicians and writers, scientists are rarely impelled to their trade for personal enrichment. In fact, science prizes such as the  Templeton  and  Breakthrough  are worth far more than the 9 million Kroner, or about US$983,000, cash purse of the Nobel Prize. Some physicists speculate that every winner of these more munificent awards would gladly  forgo the extra cash for a Nobel. But Alfred Nobels intent wasnt to swell scientists wallets. Instead, he wanted to  bring attention to their beneficial work  and incentivize new inventions. In this regard, the Nobel Prize has vastly exceeded Alfreds modest expectations.

It wasnt always this way. When the inaugural Nobel Prizes were first awarded in 1901, Wilhelm Rontgen, who won the physics prize for his discovery of X-rays, which surely improved the lives of billions around the world, was so unmoved by the accolade that he didnt even show up to collect his medallion.

Yet, by the mid-1900s,  Burton Feldman claims  science became increasingly incomprehensible to the public...when the media began its own expansion and influence. These factors conspired to elevate the stature of the Nobel Prize along with the prominence of the laureates who are bestowed it.

Generally, most of my colleagues believe that Nobel winners in chemistry and physics deserved their prizes. Yet, is it the scientist laureates, all mankind, or the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences  the entity charged with laureate selection  that benefits the most from the Nobel Prize?

The Nobel Prizes have seen many radical changes in nearly a dozen decades since they were first awarded. Despite their lofty status, my investigation into the history of the Nobel Prizes shows that they have not always lived up to the objective of benefiting mankind.

A lawsuit by Alfred Nobels great grandnephew, Peter Nobel, alleging use of the Nobel name for political purposes forced a name change: The prize formerly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics  a prize not endowed by Alfred  bears the winsome new title The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.

Peace prize winners have  sued the Nobel Foundation over grievances  in the awardees past, including leaders considered by some to be terrorists, such as  Yassir Arafat, or to be warmongers like  Henry Kissinger.

Contemporaneously, James Watson and Francis Crick were coming to a similar conclusion but didnt have the hard data to support their claim.

Later the duo, along with Franklins male collaborator Maurice Wilkins, went on to win the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.Jewish Chronicle Archive/Heritage-Images

While the two physical science prizes have not been plagued by the horrific allegations being brought against the literature prize, they are hardly the redoubts of gender equality: Fewer than 1 percent of the prizes in the sciences have gone to women.

I suggest that its time that all the Nobel Prizes, including the science prizes, take a year off to reevaluate and reflect on Alfred Nobels lofty vision.

How can a yearlong hiatus restore the Nobel Prizes to their past luster? First off, a reevaluation of the mission of the prizes, especially the stipulation that they benefit all mankind, should be paramount.

The 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Otto Hahn and not to his female collaborator Lise Meitner. Briggs, C.A

We need to revise the statutes, untouched since 1974, to allow for new prizes and rectify past injustices. This could be achieved by allowing both posthumous Nobels, and prizes for past awards that failed to recognize the full cohort of discoverers. Unless we do so, the Nobels misrepresent the actual history of science. Examples of such omissions, unfortunately, abound.  Ron Drever diedmere months before he likely wouldve won the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics. Rosalind Franklin lost her fair share of the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. Lise Meitner was denied her status as a 1944 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry for nuclear fission, which was awarded solely to her collaborator Otto Hahn.  Jocelyn Bell, discoverer of pulsars, lost her Nobel Prize to her Ph.D. advisor. Many others  mostly women  living and deceased had also been overlooked and ignored.

To initiate the reform process, with help from colleagues and interested laypeople, my colleagues and I have established a new online advocacy forum that encourages the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to rectify past wrongs, prevent old mistakes from causing new harm, and more accurately reflect the broad panorama that is modern science. The  Losing The Nobel Prize forum  is open to scientists and nonscientists alike to submit proposals to reform and improve the Nobel Prizes.

Thoughtful action now is crucial and has tremendous potential far beyond academia. Revisiting and revising the Nobel Prize process, correcting past mistakes and making the process more transparent in the future will redound to the benefit of all mankind, reinstating the Nobel to its legendary stature.

2018-10-20,Daily Beast,Trump Declares War On Immigration In Fiery Arizona Rally,"MESA, Ariz.Calling the rising number of undocumented immigrants entering the United States like a war, President Donald Trump framed the upcoming midterm elections in this border state as nothing short of an existential battle for the future of the nation, and potentially, his presidency.

The Democrats dont care what their extremist immigration agenda will do to your communities, Trump told the crowd at the International Air Response Hangar, an open-air facility on the outskirts of the sprawling Phoenix metroplex. That platform, Trump said, is going to totally bankrupt our country, because all the Democrats want is power.

Under two enormous bannersPROMISES MADE and PROMISES KEPTTrump told an audience of roughly 4,000 people that a Honduran migrant caravan, also roughly 4,000 people, would break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our nation if it were to enter the United States.

Theyre fighting some bad people in that group, Trump said, of the Mexican military. You see the people come up and you listen to the fake news back there, and youd think theyre all wonderful people! You got some bad people in those groups, you got some tough people in those group, and Ill tell you what: This country does not want them .

The presidents persistent focus on immigration throughout his 53-minute speech showed where he is placing his political bets less than three weeks before midterm elections that will decide control of Congress. Whereas speakers who introduced the president focused on tax cuts, strengthening the military, and electing down-ballot Republicans to state and federal office, Trump returned, again and again, to the rallying cry of immigration.

Democrats want to throw your borders wide open to deady drugs and endless gangs, Trump said. Come on in! Come on in!

It is sick , Trump said, calling groups of undocumented immigrants pursued by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement nests.

The issue has been increasingly conspicuous as the presidents top priority in recent weeks, as the wave of Republican enthusiasm following the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court has somewhat ebbed. Support for the sweeping tax reform package, the presidents signature legislative achievement, has similarly slipped since its passage in late 2017, and nowadays is a better turnout mechanism for Democrats than for Republicans.

With his proposed wall along the U.S. southern border unbuilt and his most identifiable administrative response to immigration involving holding immigrant children in cages, Trump may see hitting the unrealized goals of his immigration agenda as the best motivator for base voters who, without Trumps name on the ballot, might otherwise sit the midterm elections out.

They dont want us to have the wall, Trump said of Democrats in Congress. They will fight to the death because they dont want the wall, but we started the wall anyway and were gonna get that done.

The president clearly sees the issue as a winner, even more so than trade. Trump tweeted on Thursday that the onslaught of undocumented immigrants crossing into the United States from its southern border needed to be stopped by any means necessary. Immigration, he said, is far more important to me, as President, than trade. The president also threatened to kill the United StatesMexicoCanada Agreement, his tweaked revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement, if Mexico failed to halt illegal immigration into the United States.

The president even turned his ire towards legal immigration, lambasting chain migration, the visa lottery, and due process for asylum claims.

It sounds so good, chain migration, like right out of school, everyone comes together, Trump said. We need to allow people in based on merit .

Although the majority of his rally was composed of reprises of classic hits about border walls, fake news, and locking former political opponents in jail, Trump also stumped for Rep. Martha McSally, who is in a tight race to replace outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, a longtime Trump foe. Trump called McSally a great womanIll tell you, I know her wella great woman. Shes smart, and shes tough, and shes brave, and she can fly an airplane better than anybody.

Marthas opponent is a far-left extremist, Trump said, referencing comments from the early 2000s where Sinema flippantly told a radio host that she has no problems with Americans defecting from our country to join the Taliban.

This is what you want as your senator? Trump asked the crowd. I dont think so.

A vote for Kyrsten Sinema is a wasted vote, but more importantly, its a dangerous vote.

McSally, a Republican member of Congress with a moderate legislative track record who declined to endorse Trump ahead of the 2016 presidential election, emerged from a bruising primary with renewed Trumpist vigor. The former combat pilot hosted Trump earlier on Friday at Luke Air Force Base outside of Glendale, Arizona, where Trump lauded her as brilliant and brave and her opponent as very, very strange.

The hangar, packed to the rafters with fans of the presidentsmore than the usual percentage kitted out in red MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN baseball caps, perhaps to shield from the oppressively bright autumn Arizona sunrepresented a radical change of scene from the presidents last rally in the Valley of the Sun. In August of last year, a rally at the Phoenix Convention Center ended in near-riots, as protesters threw rocks and bottles at law enforcement, who responded with tear gas.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against Chief Jeri Williams of the Phoenix Police Department and the city of Phoenix, accusing the police of using excessive force against the protesters, and threatened a temporary restraining order if Trump were to try holding a rally downtown again.

Having a rally in downtown Phoenix is quite a bit different than having something out on the outskirts of Maricopa County, said Kathy Brody, legal director for the Arizona division of the ACLU.

The audience, most of whom had waited in a sun-baked queue for hours to enter the private air hangar, was ebulliently receptivechants of build the wall! interrupted the presidents speech no fewer than three times.

Hes the only guy whos willing to actually do something on immigration, Richard Guzman, a retiree in Sun City, told The Daily Beast. Here in Arizona, people have been talking about it forever, but nobodys actually done anything until Trump.

2018-05-07,Daily Beast,The Russian MMA Fighter Linked to Trump Cohenand Putin,"The Russian fighter was in Chicago, killing time with his entourage in the days before a mixed martial arts bout, when the call came.

FBI agents were looking for him. A fearsome heavyweight known as The Last Emperorand whos beloved by Russian President Vladimir PutinFedor Emelianenko had been in America for only five days before the feds appeared at his hotel near OHare Airport on Tuesday, April 24.

A decade before, Emelianenko had headlined an MMA league championed by Donald Trump and his personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen. The outfit went bust after only two fights.

Now, Cohen is the subject of a major federal investigation. Two weeks prior to the rendezvous with Emelianenko, the FBI raided Cohens New York home, office, and hotel room in search of records related to his payout to porn star Stormy Daniels in the run-up to Election Day. (Cohen is also reportedly being eyed by special counsel Robert Mueller in his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.)

Jerry Millen, Emelianenkos manager, declined to discuss what the G-men asked the 41-year-old warrior, who won his Bellator slugfest in 48 seconds four days later. The FBI interview was first reported by The Telegraph of London, then the Associated Press.

They told us theyd be at the fight on Saturday, Millen said of the federal agent and a translator, who came from the FBIs Chicago bureau and chatted up Emelianenko for 20 minutes before handing him their business cards. They said theyd be in plainclothes and we wont know theyre there.

When asked if Emelianenko has a relationship with Cohen, Millen replied, Not that I know of.

Its unclear whether the FBI interest in Emelianenko, a slightly pudgy bruiser with a shaved head and stony gaze, is connected to either inquiry. But Millen, who partnered with Trump on a failed reality TV show featuring Emelianenko, said everything the MMA legend does is above board.

Fedor is one of the best people I know, Millen added. Hes not involved in any goofy shit at all.

Millen wants President Trump to attend Emelianenkos next fight in the fall. And he hopes the Russian president will make it, too. It would cause havoc, but if Trump and Putin want to meet, why not meet at Fedors fight? Millen told The Daily Beast.

Fedor works for Putin, Millen said. Hes very close to Mr. Putin and a big supporter of Mr. Putin and hell probably go back to work, after this is all over, for the government of Russia as sports ambassador. Indeed, Emelianenko was a member of Putins United Russia Party and in 2012 was placed on the Russian presidents sports advisory council.

Donald Trump loves Fedor, the manager added. So what better place to meet [than] at the next Bellator event?

When asked if his dreams of a Putin-Trump showdown was all talk, Millen answered, If I can make it happen, I will. I think itd be awesome if Trump and Putin were in the ring together for a Fedor fight.

Emelianenko was linked to the future American president as early as 2008, when the Affliction apparel company launched an MMA league in answer to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).

Before Afflictions MMA venture, the UFC had prohibited its fighters from wearing Affliction duds during events. I dont like the way they do business, UFC President Dana White told Bleacher Report of the clothing line, which had been sponsoring the sports fighters. In response, Affliction launched a league of its own.

In May of that year, at a press conference at Trump Tower, the real estate mogul declared his partnership with Affliction and announced its first pay-per-view fight. Emelianenko would be the star of the July 2008 bouttitled Affliction: Banned, in a nod to the turf war with the UFC.

Trump held another presser one month later to announce the signing of Belarusian fighter Andrei Arlovski. Ive got a lot of money. That helps, right? But also and perhaps more importantly, I seem to get a lot of attention, Trump told reporters.

If we make money, thats great, Trump added, I think we will. I think it will be successful. What I do is usually successful.

Cohen was named Affliction Entertainments chief operating officer in a press release touting Banned, which drew thousands of fans to the Honda Center in Anaheim, California, and starred a Megadeth performance. Cohen said he was nearly speechless that Trump and Affliction trusted him to make MMA magic happen.

This is like having Ali, Frazier, Tyson, Holyfield and other top heavyweights all on the same boxing card, Cohen said at the time. Its unprecedented and will revolutionize the way MMA fans view this sport.

Even Donald Trump Jr. was touting MMA, a sport John McCain once called human cockfighting. Trump Jr. told Mens Fitness the Trump Organization was investing money in Affliction, not just providing name recognition. Were obviously a very cash-rich company, he said. So we can come into something to make sure its done appropriately. Depending on how everything goes, if we have to put in more, well put in more.

Tom Atencio, then-vice president of Affliction MMA, said he and Todd Beard, Affliction clothings late president, dreamed up the idea to host bouts of their own in competition with the UFC. Beard died in 2014.

Trump got involved through mutual business associates, Atencio said. Meanwhile, Millen claims that a manufacturer of mens suits introduced Beard to Trump. (Back then, Millen was vice president of M-1 Global, an MMA promoter based in St. Petersburg, Russia, which co-promoted Affliction events.)

Despite Trumps grandstanding, its unclear whether his company had a financial stake in the fight club or simply licensed his name. I really cant speak about it, Atencio told The Daily Beast. I guess the easiest way to say it: It was a lot different than the public understood it to be. At the time, we did things just like any other business. Its kind of a facade, if you will. Nothing is always as it seems.

Trump, along with boxing promoter Oscar De La Hoya, was brought in to make MMA a mainstream sport, Atencio said. It got in the mainstream media because of him, Atencio said of Trump.

Atencio said he met with Cohen, the chief operating officer, a few times for lunch but that at the end of the day, he was really Donald Trumps lawyer and had nothing to do with the events. Atencio said he got a big kick out of seeing Cohens COO title in recent news reports.

He told me that he studied martial arts, Atencio said of Cohen. He was a really nice guy. [But] he wasnt involved in any of the operations or putting things together. Nothing. They would have lunch again after Afflictions collapse, when Atencio visited New York.

All three Affliction events featured Emelianenko as the main event. But the company, which was hemorrhaging cash on glitz and payroll, folded before the third bout, Affliction: Trilogy, which was scheduled for August 2009.

Emelianenko was slated to battle Josh The Babyfaced Assassin Barnett, who tested positive for steroids weeks before the event. Affliction pulled the plug, claiming they couldnt find a replacement.

I always said in the media... it was our third event and had we broke even or at least gotten close to breaking even, we would have continued to move forward, Atencio said.

Yet Emelianenko and M-1 sued Affliction two months later, saying Barnett wasnt the reason the league went under. According to the lawsuit, which alleged a breach of contract, Emelianenko was to fight a minimum of three bouts, for $300,000 each, plus travel and accommodation expenses.

The Russian brawler claimed M-1 helped to secure a new opponent, Brett Rogers. He also claimed he informed Affliction he was willing to pit himself against several other fighters, including Bobby Lashley, court papers state.

Emelianenko accused Affliction of having ulterior motives. The league was secretly securing a sponsorship deal with UFC and failed to inform him of their intention to cancel Affliction: Trilogy, the complaint claimed. On July 24, 2009, as the fighter was on a plane bound for Los Angeles with a 30-man entourage, the UFC and Affliction were allegedly negotiating the upstart leagues demise. When Emelianenko landed in L.A., he learned his third matchup was toast, his lawsuit alleged.

The parties settled the case in August 2011, court records show. Attorneys for both sides declined to comment to The Daily Beast.

Mike Bassiri, then general counsel for Affliction, said he helped negotiate contracts with the fighters and the venues. He declined to answer whether Trump invested in Afflictions MMA arm but said the companys T-shirt business, along with pay-per-view revenues, financed most of the fight productions.

When asked if Trump took legal action after Affliction shuttered, Bassiri said no. Asked about a potential settlement with Trump, he answered, I cant discuss that with you. Im sorry. MMA was blowing up, Bassiri recalls, and Trump wanted to be a part of it.

Emelianenko was at the center of another failed enterprise backed by Trump: a reality TV series called Fighting Fedor. Millen pitched the 15-episode project, which was supposed to be taped in St. Petersburg, Russia.

In October 2008, Affliction announced it would begin filming the show, which would send 16 unknown fighters to Russia for a chance to battle Emelianenko. Trump and M-1 Global were listed as partners.

I dont know who is going to make it through, but whoever it is will be incredible, Trump said in a press release for the Soviet spectacular, adding, Im going to be there, but I dont want to compete on the show.

Filming for the series never got off the ground. Millen said internal disagreements led to the projects downfall, especially after he left M-1 Global and Afflictions MMA bid failed. We just didnt do it, Millen said.

Still, Trump sat ringside for Afflictions pair of California contests. Melania Trump joined him for at least one, according to an Orange County Register columnist who attended Afflictions sophomore battle in January 2009. I think its very brutal, Melania told the reporter. But its a business and a sport.

Donald Trump interrupted her and declared, You know why she comes? Because she has no choice. (The OC scribe, who was on the hunt for female MMA fans, also spotted Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag from MTVs The Hills and porn star Jenna Jameson, who was dating MMA fighter and Apprentice contestant Tito Ortiz.)

Three days before Affliction: Banned, Trump appeared on The Howard Stern Show to plug his foray into MMA. We have Fedor the Russian who has never been defeated, Trump boasted, adding, His thing is inflicting death on people. Hes abnormally strong.

His neck, I think its like 28 inches, the now-president added.

Trump told Stern he loves boxing, but that the sport has lost an edge and you get tired of it. He suggested MMA quenched a need for something more violent.

Well, this way, its sort of like... somebody dies, Trump said. Ive never seen anything like it, and its terrible... Its not like Oh, how are the judges voting, OK. Its like, you know, somebody just succumbs."
2018-09-05,Daily Beast,Craig Melvin May Bring a Welcome Bite to NBCs Today,"If youre a keen NBC Today show watcheror an early morning TV Kremlinologistkeenly attuned to who is sitting at the main desk and when, then Craig Melvins appointment as a co-anchor (or news anchor, to give him his proper title) of NBCs morning show will not have come as a surprise.

The announcement was made on Tuesday, even though the words news anchor were not mentioned by co-anchor Savannah Guthrie. (Anchor issues, anyone?)

On air we were told Melvinwho also anchors MSNBC Live on weekdayshad stepped away from Weekend Today so he can be with us every morning, which puzzlingly failed to both tell viewers precisely about Melvins new job and accord him the right kind of props for being promoted to it.

A week ago on Saturday, Melvin announced on air he was leaving his Weekend Today anchoring duties. His wife and children were waiting off-camera for hugs at the end of that show.

By Monday, Melvin was sitting alongside Savannah Guthrie while Hoda Kotb was away.

For some time Melvin has been present at the main Today desk after 7.30 a.m., when the main drag of serious news begins to segue into celebrity and human interest stories.

He has even been sighted at the desk before 7.30 a.m., in what was traditionally the first, 20-minute unbroken patch of the biggest stories of the morning presided over by the two main Today anchors; for some time Melvin has been, visually at least, a co-anchor in all but name.

His appointment is a significant moment. Guthrie and Kotb became the anchors of the show in the wake of Matt Lauers firing (they had to break the news of Lauers sex scandal that very morning in an emotional broadcast), and both the presence and optics of two women fronting the broadcast was its own implicit statement of female empowerment and redress.

Al Roker and Carson Daly were male foils, providing weather, pop culture bulletins, and general japery when required.

Many moons on, the introduction of Melvin as an official co-anchor implies that the producers think a more emphatic male presence at the helm of the show is once again required, and they have very stealthily introduced Melvin by the incremental increase of his presenceout on the road with Roker, in the studio across a range of stories, in the kitchen happily doing, as Guthrie and Kotb do, the serious and not-so-serious stuff.

Melvin is not an identikit anchor. He is as handsome in a well-tailored suit as anchors must be, but he is also a welcomingly, freshly forthright presence. Sure, he yaks about family and all the softball and lifestyle material that Today show anchors must cheerily chew on day in day out. But he is also notably sharp.

It was Melvin who in June asked Bill Clinton about Monica Lewinsky and whether he would have behaved differently had their sex scandal unfolded in the time of #MeToo. Clinton maintained he had apologized to Lewinsky publicly and that was sufficient. Melvin persisted with his questioning, and the interview was a bracing joust.

Melvin hasat least for the show he finds himself ona distinctive spirit of gentle dissension, a spirited pointedness.

It was again on display, when sitting with Guthrie in Megyn Kellys habitually rogue 9 a.m. hour, Melvin asked Kelly about Gretchen Carlson, her former Fox News colleague now mired in controversy and accusations of bullying by the reigning Miss America, Cara Mund.

This was a fascinating moment, because tonally Kelly is the real cuckoo in the early morning nest on NBC, an angular tough presence to the 7 to 9 a.m. shows softer curves and the 10 a.m. jolliness of Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford.

Kelly is the one known for being direct, for asking the gotcha question, and here she was utterly gotchad herself, and Melvin was responsible.

Typically, it is Kelly flooring guests (and even her host network) in the first 20 minutes of the show addressing the days hottest topics.

On Tuesday she opined that an independent investigator was best placed to discuss NBCs newsgathering practices in the continued wake of what exactly happened to scotch Ronan Farrows reporting on Harvey Weinstein appearing on the network.

Her show is a dizzying mix of this sharp polemicizing (also evident after Lauers firing), tough interviewing (her skewering of Michael Cohens lawyer David Schwartz was a treat), and her quite brilliant simultaneous embrace and rejection of the cooking segments she must do.

But that morning it was Melvin who asked Kelly: You know Gretchen Carlson? Some of the stuff she [Mund] claims? Do you find it believable?

This was an excellent, natural question to ask.

Savannah Guthrie thought differently. Oh my gosh, you are the worst, she said to Melvin, in a joking voice that wasnt joking.

No, he was doing what every journalist sitting across from Kelly should have done (and which Guthrie does in her best interviews too), which is to ask fresh and different questions of an interviewee.

Can I not interview the interviewer? Is that wrong? Melvin queried, smiling but serious and absolutely right.

Is this Meet the Press? asked Guthrie, to audience laughter. Journalists arguing, even lightheartedly, against the tenets of basic journalism is always depressing.

But Guthries gentle protest, albeit rooted in a loyalty to Kelly, was misplaced. It reminded me that Today hosts are celebrities first, with an imagined and cherished ring of protection around them against such unpredictable intrusions of unexpected questions and serious enquiry.

Kelly, who (boot on the other foot) would have asked the question (and more), was silent.

Now you know how Bill Clinton felt when Craig was asking him all the questions, joked Guthrie.

The strange thing was Melvins question was of the mildest kind, aimed not at making Kelly feel uncomfortable (although he noted that it might) but at expanding the debate.

Ive no idea what Gretchen has done with the Miss America pageant. Let's leave it at that, Kelly said tightly.

It says a lot about Melvin that he politely tried to elicit some answers from Kelly on her polemical home turf, not rudely but in the spirit of finding a new anglewhich, after all, is what a show like Today, indeed any journalism, should be about.

The shows anchor desk has increased one in number. It may also have increased its bite."
2018-10-31,Daily Beast,Facebook and Instagram Ban the Proud Boys and Founder Gavin McInnes,"Facebook and Instagram banned Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes and Facebook groups affiliated with his far-right mens club on Tuesday, a day after The Daily Beast reported that McInnes was using both platforms to post racist images and promote violence against liberals.

The Proud Boys, a street-fighting club of self-described Western chauvinists, have come under increasing scrutinizing from both law enforcement and social media platforms after members of the group brawled with left-wing antifascist protesters on October 12. The fight, in which some Proud Boys yelled homophobic slurs, has resulted in criminal charges against nine Proud Boys and three antifa activists.

McInnes, a Vice cofounder who left the company in 2008, was banned from Twitter in August. The trash-talking Proud Boys leader now faces a severely limited social reach, especially with Gab, the far-rights social network of last resort, offline following the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.

Business Insider first reported the Facebook and Instagram bans.

The bans from Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, were prompted by both sites policies on hate groups.

Our team continues to study trends in organized hate and hate speech and works with partners to better understand hate organizations as they evolve, a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. We ban these organizations and individuals from our platforms and also remove all praise and support when we become aware of it.

Losing Facebook groups could be a serious blow to the Proud Boys, who used public and private regional groups to recruit and vet new members. The Southern Poverty Law Center has called private Proud Boys Facebook groups ideological echo chambers where Proud Boys planned their often-violent appearances at political rallies."
2018-02-12,Daily Beast,Donald Trumps Inaugural Committee Still Wont Say What Its Doing With Its Leftover Money,"Representatives for President Donald Trumps inaugural committee still wont say what the committee didor plans to dowith the tens of millions of dollars it pledged to charity last year. And it may be many more months until the public finally knows.

The committee smashed the record for inauguration fundraising, bringing in about $107 million, double the sum raised for Barack Obamas first inauguration, which held the previous record. But Trumps inaugural committee only spent about half of that money. The rest, it said, would go to philanthropic ends.

More than a year later, no one knows what those ends will be.

A spokesperson for Tom Barrack, Trumps personal friend and the chairman of the committee, told The Daily Beast on Dec. 8 that it would be filing an annual report detailing its charitable giving with the Internal Revenue Service in the next several weeks. It is now Feb. 12, and it still hasnt done so and there is no indication of when it will.

The committee doesnt have to wait for a 990 filing to say where it directed leftover funds, noted Brendan Fischer, the director of federal and FEC reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, an ethics group. Even if the inaugural committee does need more time to file its 990, there is nothing stopping it from voluntarily disclosing how it spent the leftover funds, and whether any money went to charity, he said in an email.

Tom Barrack said the inaugural committee would disclose charitable contributions in Fall, Fischer added, then pushed the deadline back to November, and now here we are in February and the public still has no idea how the inaugural committee spent $107 million.

The committee hasnt operated entirely in the dark. In September, Barrack announced that the committee would donate $3 million to three charities involved in hurricane relief efforts. That pledge came after The Daily Beast inquired about the potential use of inaugural committee funds to support such efforts in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.

But those contributions amount to a small fraction of the cash left over from inauguration festivities, and the committees lawyers arent saying when the public might find out where the rest of the money went.

Contacted in December, Steve Roberts, an attorney with the firm Holtzman Vogel Josefiak Torchinsky, which represents the committee, told The Daily Beast that the filing might not come in until as late as September 2018. The inaugurals tax filing schedule would allow it to put off the filing until then if it asks the IRS for an extension.

But Tom Josefiak, a partner at the firm, told The Daily Beast in a subsequent conversation that the inaugural committee plans to file its annual report before it is legally required to do so. Josefiak would not say when that might be, and Roberts, contacted on Friday, once again declined to estimate when the information might become publicly available.

The inaugural committees record fundraising came in large measure from deep-pocketed Republican moneymen such as casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, private companies looking to win favor with the new president, and even some large Democratic donors adjusting to the new reality in Washington.

Barracks tremendous success in raising money for the occasion has kept him in the presidents good gracesso much so that Barrack was reportedly approached about replacing White House chief of staff John Kelly, who is under fire over allegations of domestic abuse by one of his former subordinates.

The sums raised by the inaugural committee dwarfed even what those running it expected to bring in. According to documents filed with state charity regulators in early January 2017, the committee projected it would raise $50 million from contributions and ticket sales.

The committees finances likely arent particularly complex, Fischer said. Considering that the inaugural committees only job was to put on a few parties in January 2017, it is difficult to see why it should need any extensions to its IRS filing deadline.

Its repeated disclosure delays, he said, really make you wonder what it is they are trying to hide."
2018-07-14,Daily Beast,The Lakers Crazed Cult of Kobe Comes For LeBron James,"LeBron James is the best basketball player since Michael Jordan. He is a master scorer who doesnt sacrifice efficiency to accumulate staggering point totals, year after year. Hes a stellar playmaker probably the most prolific passing forward in the history of the game. Bron is a tremendous defender, a decent three-point shooter, an idiom-shattering athlete who can play four positions at an elite level whenever his team needs him too. Hes won four league MVP awards, three Finals MVPs, and has appeared in the last eight NBA Finalssomething no one has done since Bill Russells timemanaging to drag teams both excellent and fundamentally flawed to the big dance, year after year.

Tim Duncan might have provided more on defense, but he doesnt have LeBrons ability to blow through the competition from the arc all the way to the rim. Steph Curry can be more innovative, his maddeningly perfect three-point shooting a beacon to every elite talent pouring in triples in gyms across the country, but he lacks the sheer physical gifts of Bron. Shaq was an all-consuming, world-devouring nightmare, sure, but his night-to-night effort was inconsistent at best.

Nearly every fan base in the NBA is on board with the fundamental truth of LeBrons supreme, era-wide domination and singular greatness. But there is one fan base that is decidedly not on board with this assessment. And LeBron just signed with their team.

Here is a tweet from SB Nations Lakers blog. Its LeBron, signing his 4-year, $153.3 million Lakers contract, flanked by his agent Rich Paul and Lakers GM Rob Pelinka. But the hat hes wearing has his logo Photoshopped out and replaced with Laker Hero Kobe Bryants hideous three-pronged dominate-destroy-whatever nonsense.

Its a pretty good joke whose message is anything but subtle: Lakers fans have been scratching and bleeding and dying and SCREAMING ONLINE about how Kobe is better than LeBron for more than a decade at this point.

Theyre wrong, of course. Kobe has more titles than Bron, but the first three were acquired playing with Prime Shaq, a near-mythical low-post monster, and didnt net him even one single Finals MVP trophy. The team went on to lose to the Spurs and, hilariously, the Pistons, in back to back years, after which Bryant chased Shaq off the Lakers in a haze of nonsense. He proceeded to wander around in the desert for several years, while organizations that werent in the thrall of a maniac made tremendous progress around him. Eventually his team, the most popular and well capitalized in the league, built a pair of squads from the bottom up around his madnesses, e.g. his tendency to pull the trigger on boring mid-range isolations. Kobe was a selective defender who played one position to the point of neurosis, profoundly inflexible in his approach, and openly loathed every coach he ever had, only managing to get by with Phil Jackson because everyone in the media told him he had to.

Kobe was also a prick that no one save Pau Gasol, the nicest man in the universe, and Derek Fisher, his personal ball boy, liked playing with. He ascribed to the Republicans buy sneakers too school of social justice (LeBron is down with the cause) and pleaded out of a civil suit that credibly accused him of sexual assault. LeBron personally went against Kobe, and only failed to beat his ass in the Finals because Kobe did everything he could to make sure he never had to face the Heat. LeBron is also on pace to outscore Kobe in his career while shooting a significantly better percentage and netting significantly more assists. Hes just better.

Kobe was not only worse than LeBron, he was also worse than everyone else Ive mentioned thus far: Duncan, Curry, Shaq and Bill Russell. He was a Jordan cover that only impressed anyone who didnt hear the original. But Ill be damned if he didnt manage to make himself Mister Lakers, doing everything possible to capture the imagination of the squad that birthed his shrieking, placenta-soaked career, hoisting stupid clutch midranger after stupid clutch midranger on his path to transmogrifying the NBAs most prominent organization into his own personal death cult, and theres not gonna be much LeBron can do to take that away from him (aside from winning, say, three to five titles out of almost nowhere).

But theres only so many years left for the Other No. 23 to play, and his young-as-shit team is tremendously ill-equipped to seriously contend this year, especially playing in a conference with the dynastic, basketball-is-a-problem-we-solved-and-were-playing-spaceball-now Golden State Warriors.

Some fans are already in open rebellion about being required to root for LeBron. Gather round and hear the sad story of The Mural That Tore a City Apart:

Its nice, isnt it? The King of LA. A tribute to the new sports hero in towoh sorry, what happened?

Oh dear. Well its OK, we can fix it! Well even take the of out, in deference to Kobe. Everything is fine...

Wonderful! Now lets all relax and enjoy the mur...

Ugh. After more than a decade of Lakers fans making their allegiances in this matter profoundly clear, living  brainwashed day and night by Kobe Propaganda, LeBron James cant just swing into town and rip the bias out of their hearts! And so, to protect the good visage of The King, the mural had to come down:

But this soap opera isnt over by a mile. For a whole year, maybe for his whole tenure with the team, there will be a nagging, itching, high-pitched whine from Lakers fans whose minds have been (mistakenly) made up on this matter for many years, and will never accept the truth that is apparent to the rest of the basketball-watching universe. And Lakers management, who have no intimate connection to Bryanthes not exactly a guy you keep around the organization to mentor youth or boost morale, seeing as hes one of the worlds biggest dickheadswill almost certainly do a horrible job of ameliorating or satisfying those people. Look at this shirt they put out, for Chrissakes:

The G.O.A.T.! On a Lakers shirt! Its delicious, how thoroughly the Cult of Kobe is getting their faces shoved in the pavement by this. And the best part is: LeBron does not care. He knows what the fan base is like, hes seen his own Twitter mentions, but he wants to live in Los Angeles and produce movies and get his kids reps in LAs excellent youth basketball scene and not play for the Clippers, so he did it anyway. This is not like when he went to Miami, where he had a superteam on the ready, or the Cavs, where he had unfinished business. This is purely a lifestyle movean older, extraordinarily wealthy dude looking to transition into the next phase of his life and live in the city in America that treats rich, famous people the best.

This isnt to say him winning a title in LA would be impossible. Hes amazing at basketball, the Lakers are young and growing and have the flexibility to make a trade to improve their roster, and the Warriors are depending on the talents of Kevin Durant, a mercurial fella at best. But come on, man, thats a secondary-as-hell set of concerns at this point in The Kings life. His presence likely wont produce gold for the Lakers, but it will dredge up pointless hatred in the hearts of their fans, and isnt that honestly even better?"
2018-04-01,Daily Beast,This Eradicated Disease Could Come Back as a Terrifying Biological Weapon,"A Discovery series released Thursday produced by Steve Rivo, Invisible Killers, explores in one episode how smallpoxeradicated in 1980could make a surprising, deadly comeback.

That might seem inherently at odds with what we think about smallpox, a disease that starts as a fever with red bumps that become painful blisters within and outside the body, ultimately causing up to half of people afflicted with it to die. There is no cure, and smallpox permanently scars not only the body but a persons organs.

But thanks to a staggering effort fronted by the World Health Organization, the disease was eradicated in 1980.

The disease isnt dead, however. There are at least two labsone in Moscow, the other with the CDCthat hold vials of smallpox in the event of an emergency, stockpiles that were supposed to be destroyed by 2002 but werent after 9/11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks made bioterror a real, looming threat. The CDC still holds reserves, in addition to enough vaccinations and treatments in the event of a surprise eruption of smallpox.

It would seem to suggest the disease and all its future iterations would be under control, but a brewing debate among policymakers and those who study smallpox biology suggests the possibility of a weaponized new strain of smallpox.

In January, David Evans, a virologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, and his colleagues, published a paper in PLOS One that shook national security experts. In it, Evans described how he and two colleagues went about ordering DNA fragments on the Internet, carefully pieced them together, created horsepox (a smallpox cousin that cant affect humans), and published their workto much backlash. Why? Security experts and public health officials argued that what Evans and his team had essentially published was a recipe for making smallpox at home and disseminating it.

Evans refused to comment on his study to The Daily Beast, instead pointing questions to a colleague unrelated to the study, an emeritus professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the University of Florida, Richard Condit.

Condits laboratory studied vaccinia, the virus used as a vaccine for smallpox, for nearly 40 years. I actually think its fair to say I played a role in helping to develop a lot of the techniques used to create synthetic pox virus, he told The Daily Beast while driving from his home in Austin back to Gainesville.

Condit wasnt drawn to virology, but said that he was interested in how genes work, studying how genes work. Viruses are simple genetic systems, he said.

That doesnt mean that viruses like smallpox should be overlooked or scoffed at, however: Their operation is extremely complex and intricate. The most unusual thing about pox viruses is that they are the only viruses that contain DNA that replicate outside the cell nucleus, in the cell cytoplasm, he explained.

Smallpox is also unique in that it has its own complete replication system. Thats unusual among viruses, which normally have to encode DNA outside the cell. Smallpox, however, is autonomous, encoding this replication machinery within the cell. This leads to smallpox's biochemical complexity; according to Condit, the simplest viruses have five genes. Smallpox contains about 200.

As viruses go, its a relatively complex organism, he said. I dont think any one can tell you why its so deadlyand a lot of that probably has to do with the fact that its so complicated.

But reproducing it? Not so hard. Condit described it as such: The technology that is used to make the synthetic virus really has to do with introducing segments of DNA into a cell under conditions where they will join up with each other to make a complete genome... What you have to do is infect cells with a closely related pox virus to provide the machinery thats necessary to join fragments and launch the infection. You let the DNA fragments join and the helperthe initial virus you addedprovides the machinery to launch the infection.

That, in a nutshell, is how to make a smallpox virus.

Condit insisted that the technology to create the virus has actually existed for decades, but that whats different now is the fact that DNA fragments are available, viable, and can be bought on the Internet.

That accessibility is in fact what makes many policymakers nervous. Condit said that if his lab were still running, it would take just some scientists and money to throw a virus together. First you have to have a laboratory that is equipped to do biomedical science, with incubators to grow a million cells, supplies, personnel that is knowledgeable, he ticked off. Setting that up is $1 to $2 million. David [Evans] told me the DNA fragments he bought were about $100,000. If my lab were starting from scratch to do the experiment, it would take six months, probably a year, could turn into two years. Finding the personnel could run about $200,000 a year, with appropriate expertise, $300,000, but it could be twice that when youre finished.

In short: Even on the expensive side, recreating a synthetic smallpox virus in a lab would take trained professionals around $3 million to do.

Michael Osterholm, director at the University of Minnesotas Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, thinks that horsepox is a gateway virus of sorts towards manipulating what we know about smallpox into a viable strain that would wreak havoc.

What especially concerns Osterholm is the fact that the recipe for creating smallpox is out for the taking. Evans paper made ripples not only because he was able to create horsepox from scratch but moreso because it was publishedwhich means people with nefarious intent could reproduce horsepox and tweak it enough to become smallpox. The principles of making horsepox virus are not different [from smallpox], Osterholm said.

Do you want to lay out a roadmap for the bad guys? Osterholm asked. The work in Canada [by Evans] is virtually a road map. Now every Tom, Dick, and Harry can do it.

According to Condit, thats not quite true. Condit emphasized that smallpox is a complex virus whose evolution and synthetic reproduction will likely also be complex and said that creating a new smallpox virus that would be both synthetic and something wed never seen before that would harm humans was beyond our capability.

Nature has worked on this [smallpox] for a long time, Condit argued. My guess is that most things you created in the lab would be less lethal than smallpox. Thats because half of the 200 genes are for tinkering with the immune system to replicate the hosts immune system response. Its an enormously complicated process.

Evans lab was not the first to piece together DNA to modify a pox. In 2001, Australian researchers published a paper in The Journal of Virology that pointed to experiments done in 1998 and 1999 where researcherswho were actually trying to make mice infertile and didn't publish results for a couple years because they were debating if it was morally responsible to do sodropped a gene into the mousepox virus.

The mice, even if they were vaccinated, were eviscerated.

Experiments like Evans and the mousepox virus that was adjusted to become deadlier show Osterholm that its very much in the realm of possibility for humans to make a smallpox virus thats much more frightening than its original form, despite the fact that Condit invoked a common phrase in sciencemice lie and monkeys exaggerateto suggest animal experiments arent necessarily translatable to humans.

The principles are no different, Osterholm stressed. Surely government sponsored labs could do it. Youd clone the public sequences. Someone can take that and alter it. We can surely guarantee with ongoing improvements in lab science that we can see a potential for more harm.

One thing both Condit and Osterholm do agree on is the relative ease by which a state-sponsored actor could replicate smallpox. The tools are readily available now to allow us to do something with viruses that we cant even imagine, Osterholm said. With well supported laboratories and new molecular genetic tools, this is Pandoras box.

Condit echoed this statement. Sure, thats righta well-equipped and knowledgeable lab could do this, he said. Davids [Evans] experiment is proof of principle. The only thing a group would have to do to create smallpox that wasnt horsepox? According to Condit, it would be to use synthetic DNA instead of fragments that previously already existed.

Osterholm and Condit also differ in their thoughts about the future of smallpox in being used as a bioweapon is our preparedness.

There was a major initiative launched to get a new and better vaccine [to cover a potential crisis in the aftermath of 9/11], Osterholm said. It [stockpiles of smallpox vaccine] would cover the U.S. population, and a little more. But its surely not adequate for the world should smallpox come back. Osterholm added that while smallpox could be contained quickly in the United States thanks to established public health measure practices, an incident in a region where an immunological response plan isnt set up could be dangerous, particularly in an age of air travel.

Osterholm said that in a scenario where a smallpox virus was created in a laboratory the creator might not be able to remain anonymous; the genes would be able to be traced, the methods and strains used found. It would be a blowback if an epidemic was traced back to a government, he said, changing a world order where such an attack would be considered a blatant human rights offense.

The recent attack allegedly by Russia of a spy and his daughter using the nerve agent novichok, however, has turned that over, though. Its possible, Osterholm said. I cant think of too many things that would cause panic than the return of smallpox."
2018-11-28,Daily Beast,Sensing Defeat Trump Cries Witch Hunt,"Donald Trump is having a very bad week to go on top of his bad month, bad year, and bad presidency, and its showing with every manic tweet and every unhinged statement. As easy as it is to view Trumps tweetstorms as the rantings of a lavishly paranoid man whos just discovered the myriad joys of cocaine, his doubling down on absurd witch hunt whining is, as always, a tell. As he ratchets up the volume well past 11, you know he feels the heat rising.

For two years, Donald Trump had fun amidst the mess. He reveled in stage-managing a reality-television version of an executive branch staffed by weak-willed and morally vacant appointees selected more for their ass-kissing skills than for any remote talent in governing or even any talent at all. He consumed every ounce of scenery, and his every desire, whim, and impulse were carried out by White House minions unable to say no. Republican Members of Congress may as well have sported Property of Donald Trump forehead tattoos.

During those halcyon days, the power of the Republican House was used to obstruct justice, block the Mueller probe into Russias pro-Trump efforts, and to attack the intelligence community in order to protect Team Putin. They were a blocking force against investigations into his taxes, finances, and his administration's misdeeds. Trump has never displayed even the most cursory interest in governing or leadership, but he loves the roar of the crowd, the high-fructose smell of the MAGA set jammed into arenas, his long-running pissing match with the media, and trolling the known universe on Twitter. A supine House was his shield.

Donald Trump, a princeling who was raised in luxury, never held accountable for any of his countless personal and business betrayals and failures, and who literally lived in a golden tower for most of his life, is not good with stress. His rage-tweeting shows us that he knows he cant juggle all the crises steaming toward him, that he knows his astounding power to distort reality for his followers wont shield him from the political, legal, and personal perils closing in on him.

Playtime is over, and Donald doesn't like it.

The electoral beat-down of the midterm elections left him on political terrain thats a lot less fun than it was in his first two years. Hes never, ever getting his precious Wall. His legislative agenda just crashed and burned. Hes going to face actual congressional oversight, not a daily foot massage from do-boys like Devin Nunes. The investigatory jackboot is on the other foot now, with subpoenas and reports that cant be tweeted away or dismissed with a Hannitean roar of But her emails!Smart players began selling Trumps political stock short a while back, as special elections showed race after race decided by revulsion over Trump, and Trumpism. And yet, he sold his credulous, Fox-addled audience visions of a red wave this month. Watching 40 House seats go down in flames during a robust period of economic growth is what losers do. Trumps road-tested political brand of dodgy nationalist cultism and self-referential ego masturbation failed outside of GOP primaries. The vast majority of general election candidates Trump endorsed lost. Trumps frenemy and bootlick Ted Cruz even had a near-death experience in Texas. Texas!

Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, states Trump knows are vital to his reelection, are being hit and hit hard by the dumbassery of his trade war, and suburban voters in those states, particularly women, helped elect waves of Democrats to statewide, congressional, and state legislative offices. The worst pressures on Trump come from Robert Mueller. Yes, the Mueller investigation is starting to close its steely trap around the Trump-Russia conspirators, and the notoriously close-mouthed Mueller is speaking with indictments and sentencing memoranda rather than Trumpian tweet whines.

Manafort, who appears to have blown his plea deal by lying to the feds, met with Russian intelligence asset Julian Assange just before his group joined with the GRU to destroy the Clinton campaign, the Guardian reported Tuesday. Wikileaks has denied that meeting took place, but theres little doubt that Assangewhos now lost the cat he presumably stroked like some cut-rate Bond villain while holed up inside the Ecuadorian embassy in Londonis the subject of a criminal complaint in the U.S.and that Wikileaks! We love Wikileaks! has gone from an applause-line at Trump rallies to a hot wire connecting his campaign and its outside allies like Roger Stone and Jerome Corsi back to Russian intelligence services.

Those answers Trump says he wrote himself, like a big boy, last week to the special counsels questions were spun by the grown-ups in his White House as a coda to the investigation. In fact, it now appears that Robert Mueller carefully timed his withdrawal of Manaforts plea agreement to line up with the president finally turning in his homework. Mueller is careful, methodical, and strategic. His silences are important, disciplined, and consequential. He speaks through the courts, not Twitter.

In New York State, the investigation into Trumps phony charity and what is alleged to be a multi-generational tax-scam that built the Trump familys wealth are well under way. Both investigations are making Trump and his spawn nervous; both the former CFO of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg, and Trumps former fixer Michael Cohen are singing like birds, drawing out details for prosecutors the president cant fire. Cohen, even as the White House shows some big-kid discipline for a change and mostly ignores him, is one of the loosest cannons rolling across the deck of the S.S. Trump.

For the better part of two years, Trump was able to take credit for an economy fueled first by the tail end of the Obama/Fed lending boom of the late 2000s and then a sugar rush from last years tax bill. Pointing at the stock market like some member of a cargo cult tribe in the South Pacific has become the mainstay of Trump's economic chest-beating. Now, the party is wrapping up, and there are fewer and fewer bright spots on the economic horizon.

Trump's idiotic trade war has led to bankruptcies and economic stress for farmers across the Midwest and northern tier states. GM is closing plants across the country. Trumps constant credit-grabbing about the economy means theres nowhere to hide when the credit turns to blame, as much as hell cry about the perfidy of the Never Trumpers, George Soros, the media meanies, and the Freemasons.

Even Trump's most reliable defenders on Fox, Breitbart, and social media wont be able to spin all of this away. There is no grand unified QAnon theory that explains how all the bad things racing headlong toward Donald Trump have nothing to do with him.

Painpolitical, economic, and legal painis coming to Donald Trump, and hes earned every bit of it. Go long on popcorn stocks."
2018-11-03,Daily Beast,Bill Maher on Being Targeted by Pro-Trump Mail Bomber Theyre So Stupid They Dont Know Science,"This past week, we learned that in addition to shipping pipe bombs to the Obamas, the Clintons, Joe Biden, Rep. Maxine Waters, CNN, George Soros, Robert De Niro and a host of others, pro-Trump mail-bombing suspect Cesar Sayoc was also looking to target comedian Bill Maher, whose management firm was evacuated after it received a suspicious package addressed to him (it was thankfully a false alarm).

And on Friday nights Real Time, the political satirist addressed the controversy as only he could.

Everybody has to vote, announced Maher to cheers from his in-studio audience, before joking, We have an election. Democrats, if youre voting by mail, make sure theres enough stamps on your thing, and Republicans, the same goes for your bombs.

We found out this week I was on the list, so... I was nominated! he added, with a nervous chuckle.

Later on during the panel portion, Maher blamed Trump for overheating his base with nasty rhetoric. How much can you gin up one section? asked Maher. And of course when you gin them up that much, some of them send bombs.

But Maher felt that the violence thats been brewing from those on the far right, from the mail-bombing suspect to the Tree of Life synagogue shooter, certainly isnt helping Trump politically, and that the Republicans may begin to turn on him. [Editors Note: This seems highly unlikely.]

With this violence the last couple of weeks, I dont think thats playing well for [Trump], Maher argued. I think [Republicans] feel like hes crazy, we like crazy for a while, but this is too crazy. And anytime it looks too crazytoo violentI think theyre going to blame him. I think they are. Hes trying to put across this idea that the Democrats are the mob, but for once bland works for Democrats. They are not the mob. Even the regular Joe gets that.

You know, hes been very lucky up until now, Maher said of Trump later on in the program. The bomber guy? None of those bombs went off. Our best defense is that theyre so stupid, they dont know science. The guy was 0-12. The FBI came to his door, the doorbell didnt work.

Then Maher, who was visibly frustrated, lost his train of thought, exclaiming, I dont know what my fuckin question is, Im so pissed off."
2018-02-08,Daily Beast,Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin Must Come Out of Hiding Judge Rules Lawyer Claims He Lives in Cambodia Now,"Vanished neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin must give up his whereabouts, a federal court in Montana ordered Wednesday.

Anglin, who runs the white supremacist website Daily Stormer, has been on the lam for a year, fleeing a lawsuit by a Jewish woman whose address Anglin posted online. The woman, Tanya Gersh, is suing Anglin for intimidation and emotional distress after Anglin encouraged his anti-Semitic following to call her family members or stop by her Montana home. Anglins attorneys have attempted to dodge the lawsuit by claiming he lives outside the country, and that he worries for his personal safety if he reveals his location.

Anglin has until February 16 to tell the court where hes living, ruled U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremiah Lynch.

The lawsuit against him originated in the Montana hometown of fellow white supremacist Richard Spencer.

Spencer, who has called for ethnic cleansing and shouted hail Trump to a crowd of followers throwing Nazi salutes, is from Whitefish, Montana. After Spencers profile as a white supremacist rose in 2016, Spencers  mother became involved in a dispute with Gersh, a local real-estate agent. Gersh said she had simply decided not to work with Spencers mother.

But Spencers mother (or Spencer himself, Gershs lawyers claim) wrote a blog post accusing Gersh of harassment. Anglin quickly took up the story on the Daily Stormer. Jews Targeting Richard Spencers Mother for Harassment and Extortion, Anglin wrote. TAKE ACTION!

Anglin posted Gershs phone number, address, and contact information for her family.

Please call her and tell her what you think. And heyif youre in the area, maybe you should stop by and tell her in person what you think of her actions, he wrote, adding homophobic and anti-Semitic slurs about Gershs 12-year-old son.

The subsequent troll army bombarded Gersh with threatening phone calls, emails, and text messages. In April 2017, she partnered with the Southern Poverty Law Center to sue Anglin for distress and intimidation.

The neo-Nazi hasnt been seen since.

Anglins lawyer Marc Randazza claims Anglin cant face the lawsuit because he does not belong to any U.S. state. Randazza said Anglin fears for his physical safety if his address was revealed, even if its in court documents and not in a blog post, like Anglin did to Gersh.

Anglins lawyer entered court documents purporting to show that Anglin became a domiciliary of Cambodia days before Gersh filed her suit. Among those documents are a temporary, nonimmigrant visa for Cambodia, a tourist visa from Laos, and pictures of a Cambodian hotel where Anglin claims to live. Randazza submitted a picture of a motorcycle Anglin allegedly purchased, claiming it was proof Anglin intended to live in Cambodia long-term.

Gershs lawyers said Anglins claim to Cambodian residency was laughable.

Defendants production shows nothing more than a tourist wandering through Southeast Asia in 2017, with motorcycle rides through Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia, extended visas to ease travel between them, and comfortable stays at seemingly lavish yet affordable hotels, Gershs lawyers wrote in a response to Anglins lawyers. But it certainly does not show that Defendant, a United States citizen, changed his domicile to any foreign country such that he can escape this Courts jurisdiction."
2018-07-23,Daily Beast,More Victims Sue USC Over Dr George Tyndalls Rampant Sex Abuse They Were Protecting a Predator,"Another 51 women have filed a lawsuit against the University of Southern California over decades of alleged sexual abuse by Dr. George Tyndall, who treated thousands of students while working as the only full-time gynecologist at the school for almost 30 years.

He wouldn't have gotten away with it if USC had stepped up, said Andy Rubenstein, who represents the 51 women filing suit on Monday. They were protecting a predator.

According to Mondays complaints, the school concealed years of reports about the now-71-year-old gynecologist, including several from female nurses who allegedly witnessed his abuse. Rubenstein is a Houston lawyer whose firm reportedly used Facebook and other advertisements to reach former patients of the notorious doctor, according to the Los Angeles Times. The plaintiffs include women from all over the United Statesand Britain, and Israeland across generations. The Times has covered Tyndalls alleged abuse since May, when six women first came forward with accusations against him.

Since then, more than 200 former USC students have joined several civil suits against the university. The women allege that Tyndall inappropriately photographed students genitals, made lewd or sexual comments about their bodies, and touched patients unnecessarily or inappropriately without medical gloves, the Times has reported.

Tyndall allegedly asked his patients to strip naked and lie on the exam table so that he could inspect every inch of their body, while making unseemly and sexually-charged comments about their flawless and creamy skin and perky breasts, according to Mondays complaints.

Former USC student Dana Loewy told ABC News in a televised interview on Monday that she sought treatment from Tyndall before she received her Ph.D. in 1995. She noted that he seemed preoccupied with the tattoo on the inside of her thigh, calling it, Oh, a picture for me.

According to Mondays complaints, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Tyndall insisted that Loewy was a virgin despite the fact she had been in several committed intimate relationships with boyfriends. When she said her current partner was a woman, he allegedly responded: Is it true that all lesbians hate men?

A blind eye was turned towards these womens pleas for help, said Rubenstein, in a statement released Monday afternoon. Sexual abuse is a horrific offense and covering it up is equally troubling. USCs inexcusable inaction gave Dr. Tyndall the opportunity to abuse countless more patients over many years.

This is an issue that has arisen at too many colleges and universities, and it needs to be corrected, Rubenstein added. There needs to be a clear process to ensure complaints of this nature follow a firm protocol and are all treated seriously and efficiently, so that individuals do not get placed in harms way.

In one of the previous civil lawsuits against Tyndall, filed on July 13, several Jane Does also alleged that the gynecologist violated and molested them during exams.

One woman, who attended USC between 1988 and 1993, sought treatment for a possible vaginal yeast infection, according to that federal lawsuit. She was wearing a skirt, and Tyndall allegedly told her to remove her underwear rather than changing into an examination gown. Then he examined her with his fingers, while asking if she had ever had a woman perform oral sex on her. When she asked why, Tyndall allegedly explained that if a girl was licking her vagina, it may have caused her yeast infection.

That complaint claims that Tyndall went on to describe oral sex despite the fact that his patient was was very uncomfortable by the tone and subject matter of the conversation.

Another woman sought treatment from Tyndall while she was attending USC during the 2000-2001 academic year. She had never been examined by a gynecologist before and requested an appointment for birth control and STD testing, according to the July federal lawsuit. Tyndall allegedly performed a pelvic exam and inserted his fingers into her vagina. As many other women have claimed, Tyndall purportedly used the opportunity to tell the patient she was particularly tight and said she had a beautiful vagina.

In 2008, another Jane Doe saw Tyndall over vaginal discomfort when her regular gynecologist was out of town. As she was laying on the exam table, undressed from the waist down with her legs spread, Tyndall allegedly tapped on her labia several times with four fingers and said, Thats nice, according to the lawsuit. Doe claims she was one of several women who wrote a letter of complaint to the executive director of student health at the time.

In the spring of 2013 alone, at least eight others in Tyndalls office reported concerns about the gynecologist to their supervisor, veteran nurse Cindy Gilbert. Three years later, in 2016, Gilbert finally reported the decades-old allegations against Tyndall to the schools rape crisis center, according to the July lawsuit. That complaint eventually led to the discovery of a box of film containing womens genitalia in his office, that complaint claims. Tyndall was reportedly forced to retire from USC in 2017.

The Los Angeles Times reported last month that the combined lawsuits could now cost the school hundreds of millions of dollars and that lawyers working on the cases expect the number of victims to keep growing. They estimate that Tyndall saw up to 10,000 patients during his time at USC.

I have never seen anything like the volume of calls we are getting, lawyer John Manly told the Times last month.

The alarming thing is we have women from the very beginning of his employment in 1989 to the very end, he said. It indicates he engaged in this behavior throughout his tenure at USC.

Earlier this month, Tyndall reportedly retained prominent Los Angeles attorney Leonard Levineapparently known for defending suspects in sex crimes cases. He has repeatedly denied all of the accusations. Levine told ABC News in a statement on Monday that the ex-USC doctor followed gynecological standards with all of his patients.

He is clear that he engaged in no criminal conduct, Levine said.

No charges have been filed against Tyndall, but the Los Angeles Police Department has opened an investigation into more than 130 complaints against him and last month raided Tyndalls apartment and storage locker. According to the Times, detectives also searched USC for documents and files related to the doctor.

Despite this, USC has said it is conducting a thorough investigation on its own.

A statement issued to ABC News on Monday said: We will be seeking a prompt and fair resolution that is respectful of our former students. We are committed to providing the women of USC with the best, most thorough and respectful health care services of any university."
2018-05-17,Daily Beast,An Arizona PAC Appears to Have Blatantly Ripped Off Donors Now the Feds Are Coming After It,"The Department of Justice on Thursday brought federal criminal charges against two Arizona men accused of using fake political groups to defraud thousands of unwitting donors out of millions of dollars.

Such groups are generally referred to as scam PACs. And DOJs criminal prosecution represents a major legal escalation against the practice by which those PACs executives raise huge sums of money by promising to support political candidates or causes and simply pocket the money instead.

According to DOJ, the two Arizona men, Robert and William Tierney, operated at least nine political action committees. They raised money through telemarketing campaigns promising that donations would fund the campaigns of various political candidates, pro-life activism efforts, and autism awareness.

In fact, DOJ claims, the Tierneys were using a web of shell companies to steer the money to their own bank accounts. They raised more than $23 million, according to the indictment. The vast majority went to paying the fundraising companies that they used to solicit the money. But the Tierneys pocketed about $3.5 million, while spending just $108,000 backing the groups and campaigns they claimed that fundraising would support.

The men are charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.

The so-called political action committees served as nothing more than a front for an extensive personal fundraising campaign, said FBI assistant director William Sweeney in a statement on the indictment.

Legal experts say that DOJs indictment represents a major step towards combating scam PACs more generally.

This is a very significant indictmentthe first time the Justice Department has used the mail and wire fraud statutes against alleged scam PAC operators, said Brett Kappel, a partner at the Washington law firm Ackerman. If these defendants are convicted it will send a powerful message that consumer protection laws apply to political fundraising.

Scam PACs are common on both sides of the political aisle. The PACs capitalize on the lack of legal restrictions on the portion of their money that must be devoted to actual political work rather than staff salaries, consulting fees, and overhead expenses.

Civil complaints against such groups have seen limited success. When former Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli sued a group of alleged scam PACs for fundraising in his name and pocketing most of the money raised, the groups argued that the bulk of that money was used to cover overhead expenses associated with the fundraising campaigns themselves. That can be a difficult claim to disprove, and Cuccinellis lawsuit was unsuccessful.

The Tierneys network of PACs was particularly egregious in the sums it spent on overhead and payments to the people running it. But its different from other scam PACs only by degrees, and if DOJ is determined to go after the practice, there are scores of other political organizations that could be in legal jeopardy."

2018-08-07,Daily Beast,New Poll 43 of Republicans Want to Give Trump the Power to Shut Down Media,"Freedom of the press may be guaranteed in the Constitution. But a plurality of Republicans want to give President Trump the authority to close down certain news outlets, according to a new public opinion survey conducted by Ipsos and provided exclusively to The Daily Beast.

The findings present a sobering picture for the fourth estate, with respondents showing diminished trust in the media and increased support for punitive measures against its members. They also illustrate the extent to which Trumps anti-press drumbeat has shaped public opinion about the role the media plays in covering his administration.

All told, 43 percent of self-identified Republicans said that they believed the president should have the authority to close news outlets engaged in bad behavior. Only 36 percent disagreed with that statement. When asked if Trump should close down specific outlets, including CNN, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, nearly a quarter of Republicans (23 percent) agreed and 49 percent disagreed.

Republicans were far more likely to take a negative view of the media. Forty-eight percent of them said they believed the news media is the enemy of the American people (just 28 percent disagreed) while nearly four out of every five (79 percent) said that they believed the mainstream media treats President Trump unfairly.

But swaths of self-identified Democrats and Independents supported anti-press positions as well. According to the survey, 12 percent of Democrats and 21 percent of Independents agreed that the president should have the authority to close news outlets engaged in bad behavior (74 percent and 55 percent, respectively, disagreed). Additionally, 12 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Independents agreed that the news media is the enemy of the American people (74 percent and 50 percent, respectively, disagreed)

The concept of an enemy press corps has become a staple of Trumps tweets and public utterances in recent months. Much of it appears prompted by stories about internal frictions within the White House and a growing fear over the state of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.

Members of the press, as well as top officials at some of the nations leading publications, have objected to the phrase, arguing that it is both wildly inaccurate and deeply dangerous. They have pointed to mob-like treatment of the media by Trump supporters at various rallies as evidence for their fears. Offered the opportunity, Trumps spokesperson, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, declined to denounce the phrase. Other Trump supports have insisted that he was merely referring to those outlets that spread false information.

But Trumps daughter Ivanka and his top adviser Kellyanne Conway have both recently said they do not agree that the press is the enemy, while adding that the media plays an important socio-political role.

Respondents to the Ipsos survey seemed to generally share that belief as well. In one of the polls few silver linings for the press, 57 percent of all respondents said that they believed news and reporters were necessary to keep the Trump administration honest including a plurality of Republicans (39 percent agreeing with that statement compared to 35 percent disagreeing). A slightly less robust 46 percent of respondents said they agreed that most news outlets try their best to produce honest reporting (compared to 35 percent who disagreed). And virtually everyone (85 percent of respondents) believed that freedom of the press is essential for American democracy (compared to 4 percent opposed to that statement).

But despite support for journalistic principles in the abstract, respondents also seemed inclined to believe that reporters had too much professional protection. According to the survey, 72 percent of all respondents agree it should be easier to sue reporters who knowingly publish false information, including 85 percent of Republicans and 63 percent of Democrats."
2018-08-01,Daily Beast,A Timeline of Team Trumps Flip-Flopping on Robert Mueller,"President Trump started off his Wednesday morning withshocker!a tweetstorm demanding his Attorney General Jeff Sessions to stop this Rigged Witch Hunt, also known as Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The president said the probe needed to be stopped before it continues to stain our country any further. He continued: Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!

But Trumps animosity towards Mueller didnt always exist in its current state. In fact, there have been instances where Mueller was openly praised by White House staff. Trumps whiplash-inducing public opinions on Mueller over time have seemed to oscillate as fast as the news cycle.

Immediately following Trumps firing of FBI chief James Comey, the DOJ appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to oversee the Russia investigation.

In response, the president put out a statement, saying a thorough investigation would prove his innocence and he was looking forward to this matter concluding quickly.

But just one day after he issued that rather subdued May 2017 statement, he tweeted that the investigation was the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!

Team Trump has since launched various attacks on the integrity of Mueller and his investigative team.

For example, top White House counsel Kellyanne Conway tweeted out an article pointing out that Muellers team includes big Democrat donors. Some maxed out, none wanted Trump to be POTUS.

That overarching accusation of political bias has become something of a war cry for Trump supporters, further intensifying after FBI agent Peter Strzoks anti-Trump text messages were released and he testified about them before Congress.

Such attacks continued well into this year.

The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime, the president declared on March 17 of this year. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC... WITCH HUNT!

Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added... does anyone think this is fair? he continued. (Giuliani similarly tweeted that Peter Strzoks testimony was a disgrace and it taints the entire Mueller witchunt [sic] on June 13.)

Trump and his officials, however, took a slightly calmer tone later in the spring when pressed on whether the president would sit down for an interview with Muellers team.

The president expressed a willingness to cooperate with Muellers probe in April, saying he agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller.

Hes a patriot, a good man, served his countrydid a good job with the FBI, Trumps lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Fox News host Sean Hannity in early May 2018. I don't think he would be affected by malice or prejudice... I have an open mind about Bob.

But then come July, around the time Strzok testified before Congress, the Trump team once again retreated to questioning the fitness of Muellers leadership over the Russia probe.

Peter Strzok texted the theme of the Mueller investigation stop Trump. You can investigate an innocent man forever and never close the investigation, Giuliani wrote on July 14. After all these irrelevant indictments, 1.4 m documents and over 30 witnesses. STOP THE INVESTIGATION.

The president himself chimed in, claiming the special counselor has conflicted interests and thus cannot fulfill his duty. In fact, Trump has mentioned Muellers unspecified conflicts of interest in June 2018 and again on Wednesday.

The president this weekend debuted his Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt phrase, tweeting, that There is No Collusion! and that the Mueller probe is headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats and is an illegal Scam!

Trumps team has also continuously wavered on whether the president would ever sit down with Mueller. Just this Tuesday, Giuliani told CNN: Im sure they are in bad faith about an interview at this point.

WILL HE, WONT HE?

Trump also denied wanting to personally fire Mueller back in April, tweeting, If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him.

And despite the president putting pressure on Sessions to end the investigationeven though the attorney general recused himself and handed over control to his deputy in Rod RosensteinTrump has not officially stated that hed fire Sessions if he does not take action against Mueller.

Instead, hes seemingly relied on his officials to talk publicly about it.

Theres no doubt hes complained about him, theres no doubt he has some grievances, Giuliani said back in May. Hes not going to fire him before this is over... Nor do I think he should.

But one important member of Team Trump, the presidents 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale, recently tweeted the quiet part loud.

Time to fire Sessions. End the Mueller investigation, Parscale wrote in June. You cant obstruct something that was phony against you. The IG report gives [Trump] the truth to end it all."

Im lucky my palate wasnt scorched by years of struggle cocktails: tacky gimmick mixers by celebrity mixologists, bottle-service beverages poured out in dark clubs, and expensive headache-inducing Champagnes. I think the first good drink I had was in a Korean BBQ. It was a very simple, very humble makgeolli, which is a Korean rice farmers liquor, homemade by the chefs grandmother. More recently, I enjoyed a reddish Kawaba Beer with some extremely amazing omakase sushi at Cagen in NYCs East Village. I guess what Im saying is that the quality of a drink to me is tied to its context and not its name brand.

What book on cocktails, spirits, or food is your go-to resource? I became a fan of the Smitten Kitchen website after I had my son three years ago. I was desperate for easy to make, home-cooked meals that could be wrapped up and reheated, and Deb Perelmans down-to-earth recipes were reliable and comforting. Her new cookbook is all of the same, but paired with beautiful photos and charming explanations.

Do you have a signature drink? If so whats in it? I can make a very rudimentary MicheladaMexican beer, limes, salt, hot sauce.

Whats your favorite late-night guilty pleasure snack? SMORES! Why wait for smore opportunities to come to you on vacation when you can just grab a couple takeout chopsticks, graham crackers, Hersheys chocolate bars, and Stay Puft Marshmallows, and make the magic right there over your stovetop at home?

Is there one musician dead or alive youd like to have drink with? And what would you drink? Soju in a scooped-out watermelon at a club in K-Town with Rihanna would be so fun.

Whats your favorite shot and a beer combination? Absolut Lime and Sapporo.

Currently, which city has the best nightlife scene? Hmm... Atlanta. Especially if you want to hit their legendary strip clubs. Great trap music, lemon-pepper wings, and superhuman dancers.

What song gets a party started? Anything from Bad Boy Records from the late 90s.

Youre featured in the new AbsolutTruth campaign about New York City nightlife and culture. Which old-school New York club do you wish was still open? Moomba.

2018-09-14,Daily Beast,Hurricane Florence Two Killed Hundreds Rescued as Storm Makes Landfall,"WILMINGTON, North CarolinaHurricane Florence, which made landfall on the coastline of North Carolina on Friday, has claimed two victimsa mother and baby who were killed when a tree smashed into their home, police said.

The Wilmington family was trapped under a collapsed roof for hours. When rescuers reached them, they found the woman and infant dead and the child's father seriously injured.

A third person died in Pender County of a heart attack after emergency crews were delayed in getting to her house because of the hurricane

The Category 1 storm left some areas of the state submerged in waters 7 feet higher than normal. Hundreds of residents who stayed put had to be rescued, while around 150 people in the region near the city of New Bern were stranded in their homes.

After the the hurricanes official landfall, which came early Friday morning when the eye of the storm hit the shore, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said: It has just come ashore and will be here for a long time. This is going to be a bad storm.

Late Thursday, the edge of Florence began pummeling the Carolina coast. In a taste of what was to come, 95 mph winds were recorded and heavy rain set in. By end of morning, over half a million people were without power.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Florence was pounding the coast, and that winds as strong as 105 mph have been recorded in Wilmingtonreportedly its second highest ever. However, the National Weather Service (NWC) later said winds had died down to 80 mph.

News 13 WNC posted astonishing footage of a gas stations roof being torn off. Elsewhere, a fire was triggered by the storm after winds forced a transformer to blow. There are no reported casualties so far.

But its the storm surges that experts fear will cause most damage in the coming days. There are multiple reports of water rapidly rising on coastal streets and into buildingsgauge in Emerald Isle has reported 7 feet of flooding, according to the hurricane center.

The agency previously warned that the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline, with waters potentially reaching 11 feet above where they would usually be.

Extensive flash-flood warnings were issued early Friday morning, including for areas well inland. Residents who remain in the areas are being advised to immediately move to higher ground.

Hurricane Florence is producing a life-threatening storm surge and hurricane conditions over portions of eastern North Carolina, the National Weather Service posted on its Twitter account. The threat of freshwater flooding will increase and spread inland over the next several days.

The water is so deep in Wilmington that dolphins have been spotted swimming through the town.

A catastrophic storm surge across the coastal New Bern region has prompted rescue attempts, according to the National Weather Service, although there is no update on progress.

Peggy Perry, one of the people trapped in their homes, told CNN: In a matter of seconds my house was flooded up to the waist. And were stuck in the attic. Theres four of us. Weve been up here for like three or four hours. Theres a little window here that we might have to break up.

Buddy Martinette, Wilmingtons fire chief, said: If there is a life to be saved, we go do it. [But] when people stay back in a storm, they have to have a very low expectation that somebody is going to be able to come and help them. It is very difficult.

Sixty-two people, including an infant and many children, were successfully rescued from a hotel in Jacksonville after a basketball-size hole was found in a wall as it began to collapse. Some rooms were flooded as emergency services personnel managed to relocate those needing to be rescued.

Major General Gregory Lusk said over 500 activated North Carolina Guard soldiers and airmen are already responding to calls over the state.

President Trump has praised rescuers, tweeting Friday morning: Incredible job being done by FEMA, First Responders, Law Enforcement and all.

Meanwhile, the North Carolina Emergency Management reported that 485,143 people were without power as of 7 a.m. due to the storm surges, with the main affected counties being Carteret, Craven, and Onslow."
2018-03-18,Daily Beast,The Art of Japans Most Mouth-Watering Ramen,"There are few things in life as pleasurable as watching someone cook. To scratch that particular itch, food has somehow become a proper genre of entertainment, featuring TV shows (MasterChef, The Great British Baking Show) as well as food documentaries (Jiro Dreams of Sushi) and food-oriented movies (Burnt, Chef), because, really, who doesnt like to eat? Sure, the food youre seeing on-screen (probably) isnt immediately accessible, but theres something comforting about it anyway.

The latest entry into the genre is Ramen Heads. Directed by Koki Shigeno, the documentary provides a look into some of Japans most lauded ramen shops and the different processes and philosophies behind them. Beginning and ending with meditations on the feeling of eating ramen, it's a love letter to the dishand, to that end, not a bad double feature with Tampopo, the 1985 comedy that was heralded as a ramen western and has gained cult status since then. As one of the ramen chefs says, the ramen that a shop serves must be good enough that a customer would be happy to eat only that ramen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. (Soon afterwards, a customer waiting outside a shop says that hes eaten there over 400 times, and would be happy to have only that ramen for the rest of his life.)

Insomuch as its quite slimunlike the broths it showcasesRamen Heads is ultimately forgettable, but it should still please ramen heads (ramen baka in Japanese, which translates more literally to ramen idiots) as well as anyone looking for something relatively easy to watch. There arent exactly any stakes to it, though there is a brief emotional pull as the filmmakers detour to visit a ramen masters home and meet his family.

Osamu Tomita, known as the king of ramen and recipient of the Best Ramen of the Year award from Japans most prestigious ramen guidebook for four years in a row as of the documentarys filming, is our main subject. Once an apprentice of ramen legend Kazuo Yamagishi, Tomita has since opened his own shop, and the main narrative push in Ramen Heads is his quest to devise the perfect ramen to serve for the shops 10th anniversary. But, like everything else in the documentary, the drama takes a back seat to the ramen itself. Its interesting because his process involves calling in two other ramen masters, Shota Iida and Yuki Onishi, and experimenting with different ingredients to perfect the broth.

Though trade secrets are common in the food industry, Tomita is open about how he cooks, sharing his list of ingredients and showing off his kitchen to the visiting camera crew. The only secret he really keeps is how he mixes his broth. Its based on intuition, after all. Its the Mozart and Salieri divide, but in food, and its what makes documentaries like this so engrossing.

Theres also, of course, the endless fascination with the discipline and obsession that seem necessary in order to ascend the gourmet echelons. The chefs of Ramen Heads dont go to quite the extremes seen on shows like Chefs Table, but theyre still a dedicated bunch. Tomita stays on his feet for the entire time his restaurant remains open, without breaking for lunch. He only eats after the restaurant has closed. One of the other ramen chefs serves 700-800 people per day; 1,000 on weekends, he says, and up to 1,600 on his busiest days.

He owns the ramen shop with the highest sales volume in Japan, according to Shigeno. Hes also something of an anomaly in the world of Ramen Heads. Ramen isnt a calling for him the way that it is for chefs like Tomita. Rather, its just how he makes his living. Things dont always turn out the way you planned, he says obliquely, as he talks to a customer about the decades hes been running the shop. Ramen isnt something to theorize about, he continues, this time to the documentary crew, Theres no accounting for taste. I dont give a hoot about what ramen is supposed to be. But hes not bitter about it, nor uncaring. It just is what it is.

His candor is refreshing in a genre thats often taken to mythologizing. Its a balance for the other chefs in the documentary, who all perceive ramen as a science or an art, and labor obsessively over their techniques. (One chef sticks his rolling pin under his knee and uses his leg to help pound the noodles.) Its also in line with Shigenos ultimate exploration of ramen as, in the words of yet another chef, a food that has always been designed around the needs of time.

The only part of Ramen Heads that doesnt focus on an individual chef is an explanation of ramens history, framing it as an explicitly postwar product. Its a fascinating dive into the dishs history and evolution, and a welcome contextualization when itd be easy just to focus on the process of cooking. Through this lens, the fact that there are no stakes to Ramen Heads becomes an asset rather than a fault: The many varieties of ramen that have grown out of postwar Japan are something to be celebrated and enjoyed.

In a similar vein, Ramen Heads is a simple delight. At the risk of using too many food-related words, its easily digestible, but a treat nevertheless. Simply shot and edited (you may notice a few instances of Comic Sans), its not unlike ramen itself."
2018-03-28,Daily Beast,Rick Santorum Tries to Walk Back CPR Comments by Making the Same Point,"Less than 72 hours after he first suggested that survivors of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, should start taking CPR classes instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem, Rick Santorum admitted on Wednesday that he didnt mean that literally.

Well, the fact of the matter is I did misspeak in using the term CPR, Santorum told CNNs Chris Cuomo. Then, in an attempt to turn the controversial comments into a joke, he added, I think Sanjay Guptas job here at CNN is probably safe as being the medical commentator on things.

Medical professionals, including doctors and other first responders, pushed back against Santorums statement, with one CPR instructor characterizing the proposed solution to gun violence as grossly inappropriate.

Santorum went on to argue that the focus on his specific words obscured his larger point, which is that we should be heralding organizations and people who have actually focused on what we can do in our individual schools and communities to actually prevent these types of things.

He said he would rather see local programs to promote mentoring and stop bullying than national movements to pass stricter gun laws. What I see happen here is avoiding the issues that are really actually unifying, he continued. I think thats the most disturbing thing.

Cuomo responded by reminding Santorum about the single metric that distinguishes the United States from every other developed country that does not have nearly the same level of gun violence: access to guns. And it seems like you and others on your side of the fence are going after these kids, who are survivors, in the interest of political expediency.

Santorum insisted that wasnt the case and that he respects the students right to protest, but thats not how the organizers of last weekends March for Our Lives saw it. Appearing on the same morning show Monday, student leader Lauren Hogg called Santorums comments  completely absurd, adding, The fact that hes saying CPR when my friends are dying on my floor and nothing is being done about it is just horrible. I think hes just using it as a distraction to get their attention away from guns.

At the end of the day, if you take a bullet from an AR-15 to the head, no amount of CPR is going to save you, her brother David Hogg added, because youre dead."
2018-09-21,Daily Beast,DA Gets Over 50 Calls About Serial Date-Rape Suspects Grant Robicheaux and Cerissa Riley,"California prosecutors said they received well over 50 calls in three days about a couple accused of serial date rapes and have established at least a dozen credible leads to potential victims.

In a press conference Friday, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said his office is now investigating allegations that stretch back two decades, and the probe has expanded to several other states.

Earlier this week, Rackauckas office announced charges against Dr. Grant Robicheaux, an orthopedic surgeon who appeared on the Bravo reality series The Online Dating Rituals of the American Male, and girlfriend Cerissa Riley, a dance instructor, substitute teacher, and former Evangelical missionary.

Prosecutors claim the couple used their good looks to lure women back to their apartment, drug them, and rape them. There could be many unidentified victims, they said.

In a joint statement from their lawyers, both Robicheaux and Riley have denied any charges of nonconsensual sexual behavior.

Authorities confiscated Robicheauxs phone and  found thousands of photos and videos, some of which included women who may have been intoxicated beyond the point of consent, they said

The DA said Friday that the cellphone footage had not yet helped prosecutors estimate a total number of victims because there was simply too much to sort through. We have terabytes of digital evidence, Rackauckas said. Videos and pictures and all kinds of things.

If convicted, Robicheaux and Riley could get decades in prison for the charges they currently face, which stem from two alleged incidents of sexual assault in 2016.

In April 2016, a woman identified as only Jane Doe 1 reported to Newport Beach Police Department that she met the couple at bar and accompanied them to a party. Later that night, after Doe 1 had become too intoxicated to give consent, she alleged, the couple took her back to their apartment and raped her. A series of medical tests performed on the alleged victim the day after the incident found traces of several controlled substances.

Later that year, in October, a woman claimed she woke up in Robicheaux and Rileys apartment as they were sexually assaulting her, with intentions to rape her. Her screams alerted a neighbor, who called the authorities.

In January of this year, Newport Beach police acquired a search warrant and raided Robicheaux and Rileys residence, where they found illegal drugs, unregistered firearms, and high capacity magazines. Thats when the DAs office got involved, working over the next nine months to gather evidence against the pair.

Rackauckas encouraged women to come forward with any information related to the case. Even if you made the conscious decision to party with this couple, or with anybody else for that matter, he said, no one gets a pass to have their way with you once youre unconscious or passed the point of consent.

The couple often targeted their prey in restaurants or bars, but Robicheauxwho was named Orange Countys 2013 Most Eligible Bacheloralso may have used dating apps like Tinder or Bumble, Rackauckas said. Please be careful, he warned the public. You dont know whats behind what appears to be a perfect smile."
2018-05-09,Daily Beast,Revenge Is an Ultraviolent Rape-Revenge Saga for the MeToo Era,"Theres an oh-so-fine-line between empowerment and exploitation, and Revenge navigates it thrillinglyand bloodily, as its male and female characters gush so much crimson fluid during the course of this B-movie that its amazing they dont wind up outright desiccated.

Forty years after the premiere of notorious video nasty I Spit On Your Grave, French writer/director Coralie Fargeat channels its vengeful spirit for another tale of a woman (also named Jen!) striking back at her male sexual abusersalbeit in this case, with far more legitimate feminist gusto than her predecessor. Grim and gruesome, and boasting a style thats as unsubtle as it is scintillating, its a blast of merciless malevolence tailor-made for the #MeToo era.

Fargeat sets her scene, and her storys initial power dynamics, with her first two images: a panorama of an unnamed desert over which a helicopter zooms, and then that same sight reflected in the sunglasses of Richard (Kevin Janssens), whose stern face occupies the foreground of a pull-back shot that reveals, in its background, Jen (Matilda Lutz) sucking on a lollipop between her ruby-red lips. Courtesy of their own personal chopper ride, they arrive at a remote, luxurious house where Jen, having already turned both Richard and his pilots heads just by exiting the vehicle, takes up residence on Richards bed in order to show him some oral affection. Later that night, he fields a call from his wife, thus informing us that Jen is his mistressa situation that displeases her, though not enough to keep her from giving in to his subsequent sweet talk about her little peachy ass.

Jens derriere quickly becomes the focus of Revenge, peeking out from tiny panties and bathing suits as she struts about this isolated abode. The next morning, it becomes the object of not only Richards gaze, but his buddies Stan (Vincent Colombe) and Dimitris (Guillaume Bouchede) as well, whove appeared a day early for a male-bonding hunting trip planned by Richard. A night of carousing leads to Jen bumping and grinding up against Stan, who eerily resembles the French twin brother of Charlie Day. Jens routine is clearly playful, but deviant Stan takes it as a sign of her interest. The next day, when Richard is out acquiring permits, Stan rapes her, as Dimitri, chewing a chocolate-marshmallow candy in extremely gross slow-mo close-up, indifferently watches, and then leaves, turning the TV volume up to drown out Jens screams.

When Richard returns, his rage over Stans behavior takes a back seat to his concern that Jen might go to the copsthereby clueing his wife in to the affairand, in a fit of rage, he slaps her. That prompts a chase through the desert, which concludes with Richard showing his truly misogynistic colors by shoving Jen off a cliff, at the bottom of which she winds up gored by a scraggly tree. Before Richard and his cohorts can finish the job, however, Jen manages to free herself and take flight, thus initiating a game of cat-and-mouse in which the hunters become the...well, you know.

From Jens impalement and subsequent escape with a tree branch sticking out of her gut, to her eventual use of giant weapons that need to be properly cocked before firing, to the fiery means by which she twice saves herselfthe latter of which bestows her with a flaming bird branded on her stomachto her munching on a juicy apple and, later, exiting a cave after a trippy rebirth, Revenge gleefully drenches itself in phallic, phoenix-rising, and biblical symbolism. Throughout, Fargeat cares little for restraint, casting her material as a feverish nightmare of feminine suffering and, then, a ghastly fantasy of avenging-angel fury. As in a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-hallucination sequence, full of schizoid glimpses of fearsome birds, gushing insects and slithering lizards, the director indulges her gonzo instincts with wild abandon, all while making sure to infuse such outrageousness with sly, sick humor.

What differentiates Revenge from its numerous genre predecessors, and prevents it from falling victim to their chauvinistic shortcomings, is its refusal to revel in Jens sexual violation, which is depicted only in oblique glances that sufficiently convey the monstrousness taking place. Moreover, it performs an assured balancing act between grim survival-horror and self-conscious cartoonishness. In the figures of Richard and Stan, the former an alpha male whose ire is underscored by entitlement, and the latter a little man who acts out of insecurity, Fargeats film locates genuine truths about sexist violence via scary and absurd male caricatures. Jen, on the other hand, is a largely silent heroine, transformed from a sexpot (with Jem-style star earrings) who cares only about being noticed in Los Angeles, to a bruised-and-blackened warrior (in a bikini and an ammo belt) in search of retribution against her tormentors. In Lutz, the filmmaker finds a magnetic sexy-and-ferocious center of attention.

Revenges ensuing action is the stuff of grisly midnight movies, with Fargeat coating her sets (and characters faces) in blood and gleefully shoving her camera as close as possible to gaping wounds, including a foot sliced open by a glass shard thats apt to make ones own stomach churn. At the same time, the director marries her vigorous unpleasantness to compositionally calmer moments, such as a prolonged freak-out by Stan in an SUV, or the image of Richardafter realizing that Jen isnt interested in going gentle into that good nightslowly rising to his feet and kicking the ground and cursing up a storm in the middle of the vast desert.

In its expertly-staged conclusion, marked by a masterful single take that generates intense suspense through shifting perspectives, Revenge finally partakes in equal-opportunity objectification that parallels Jens success in leveling the playing (by which I mean killing) field. The film delivers crude thrills with assured formalism, epitomized by a vigorous portrait of Jens face seen, intact, amidst the cracks of a cars side mirror. Even when it feels like an inspired cover song more than a boundary-pushing original, Fargeats feature debut provides a down-and-dirty jolt of feminist rage and retribution that gets ones pulse poundingand which feels especially potent at this particular sociocultural moment in time."
2018-11-18,Daily Beast,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Backs Effort to Unseat Fellow Democrats,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the incoming congresswoman from New York, announced Saturday night that she would be supporting a national campaign to recruit the next generation of Democratic primary challengers.

The effort called #OurTime is being spearheaded by Justice Democrats, the insurgent outfit that recruited Ocasio-Cortez and backed a host of candidates rejecting corporate PAC money and espousing more progressive policy throughout the midterm campaign cycle.

I guess, long story short, I need you to run for office, Ocasio-Cortez said on the organizing call, which drew an estimated 700 people listeners. I really hope that many of you join me here in Congress.

The problem of money in politics is bipartisan, she continued, calling in from her Bronx apartment. It is systemic. It is not personal. Its not about an individual being a bad leader. Its about how we allow a corrupting system to really influence the most powerful positions of policymaking.

The 29-year-old Democrat was a first-time candidate when she took on the near-20-year incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) whose well-funded campaign was toppled by a grassroots effort from the fledgling Justice Democrat operation. The group, which is now soliciting candidate nominations on its website, saw other victories throughout the country with a total of four women of color joining the incoming class of Democratic House members: Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib in Michigan.

Powerful women coming together to reclaim our government is exactly what is needed right now, Tlaib, Congresswoman-elect of Michigans 13th district, said in a statement. Help uplift women like us at all levels of government. We still need more of you to run with us. So get your squad together. We are waiting for you.

Prior to the call, Justice Democrats had collaborated with the climate change-focused organization Sunrise Movement to hold a sit-in in Rep. Nancy Pelosis (D-CA) office urging her to support a Green New Deal, a comprehensive plan to address the drastically declining climate immediately. Ocasio-Cortez briefly joined the protesters to offer her support saying: I just want to let you all know how proud I am of each and every single one of you for putting yourselves and your bodies and everything on the line to make sure that we save our planet, our generation and our future. It's so incredibly important.

Afterwards, Pelosi, who is conceivably going to be the next Speaker of the House again, issued a statement that was supportive of the activists but fell short of the Justice Democrats demands. But, there are now nine Democratic members in support of establishing a select committee for the Green New Deal.

Having seen where there were electoral successes and failures in 2018, Justice Democrats want to prioritize candidates who are women, represent the diversity of communities in their district, and support the major tenets of Justice Democrats platform: rejecting corporate PAC donations, Medicare For All, free college, dismantling mass incarceration and deportations, and a Green New Deal. But also, they acknowledge that the primary process, particularly in safer Democratic districts, might yield the highest success rate for progressives challenging entrenched Democratic incumbents.

Theres lots of blue districts in this country where communities want to support a new generation of diverse working-class leaders who fight tirelessly for their voters and build a movement around big solutions to our countrys biggest problems, Justice Democrats executive director Alexandra Rojas said. Were creating an alternative pathway to Congress for grassroots candidates to become leaders in the Democratic Party.

As Ocasio-Cortez wades through this environment, both working with fellow members and encouraging the rise of new ones, she acknowledged that the challenges to the normal functioning of Congress might irk some people.

If I made people mad, they could have put me on the dog-walking committee, she joked on Saturday night, going on to add: They still might."
2018-09-05,Daily Beast,Marco Rubio and Alex Jones Throw Down in Heated Exchange Outside Senate Hearing,"Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) was speaking to the press outside the Senate Intelligence Committees hearing with top executives from Facebook and Twitter when he got an unexpected visitor: InfoWars Alex Jones.

As reporters from CNBC and other mainstream outlets asked Rubio questions about what those tech companies are doing to protect against foreign influence in U.S. elections, Jones repeatedly shouted his own conspiracy theories about the Democrats and China at the senator.

Is that a heckler? Rubio asked, laughing. I just dont know who you are, man, he added as an enraged Jones fumed and accused the senator of helping to deplatform him from his social media accounts last month.

I swear to god, I dont know who you are, man, Rubio told Jones, who seemed baffled that anyone could not be aware of his outsized presence.

When Jones, who once made the baseless claim that Rubio engaged with gay prostitutes in the 1990s, put his hand on Rubios shoulder, the conversation took an aggressive turn. Hey, dont touch me again, man, the senator said. Youre not going to get arrested, he added. Ill take care of it myself.

At that point, Jones accused Rubio of threatening to beat him up, saying, You are literally like a little gangster thug.

As Rubio tried to continue answering questions, Jones kept interrupting him with self-promotion until the senator finally said he had to go. You guys can talk to this clown, Rubio said as he walked away.

Following the confrontation, Rubio spoke to reporters about Jones, saying, I know youve got to cover them, but you give these guys way too much attention. Were making crazy people superstars. So, were going to get crazier people.

I see some scrubby guy walk up to me, step to me, acting all crazy. I didnt know who he was, Rubio added. I know the name, I know all the crazy stuff, I just dont know what he looks like. Asked if he feared for his safety when Jones touched him, Rubio replied, I just asked him not to touch me. He didnt do it again."
2018-10-02,Daily Beast,Heres the Case Against Kavanaugh the FBI Can Make by Friday,"With the Trump White House on Monday backing off its unprecedented effort to dictate an FBI investigation of its own Supreme Court nominee, the bureau now has just four days to complete its extended background check into the sexual assault allegations leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.

Theres not much chance that the bureau will be able to discover by Friday what happened at a small teenage party more than three decades ago. Even if agents find the house and the date, and witnesses who recall Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge and accuser Christine Blasey Ford together behind a closed door, that still wouldnt answer what happened behind the door.

But theres a real chance that the probe will show that Kavanaugh lied to Congress, and about matters material to his behavior as a teenager and his suitability for the court now. If the probe does not show that because agents avoided asking the questions that would uncover it, that would be another blow to the reputation of the FBI as its still reeling from then-director James Comeys handling of the Hillary Clinton probe in 2016 and by President Donald Trumps sustained attack since then on its leaders professionalism and motives.

You learn about a persons character when that person is put in a stressful situation. Kavanaugh was put in one when Fords name was put out and her accusations evidently weaponized by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) at the very end of his confirmation process. His reaction to that stressful situation exposed him.

Far from rising above a partisan attack, the nominee dropped any pretense of a judicious demeanor to proclaim himself the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.

After that angry opening statement, denying the accusations he says have been falsely leveled against him, he evaded questions about his drinking, and lied, it seems clear to me, about his teenage sex talk. Its that last one that will do him in, fittingly enough, if the FBI isnt afraid to do its job after these last few years.

As his Georgetown Prep friends each go into end up in a room with an FBI agent, theyll be asked questions related to the sexual assault that Ford has alleged. If those agents in fact have the discretion the White House insists they do, they should also ask:

Kavanaugh said FFFFF was a reference to his friend Squees stuttering. Is that how you used the term and understood him to, or did it mean find em, french em, finger em, fuck em, forget em?

Kavanaugh said at his confirmation hearing that the term boofing in his yearbook referred to flatulence. Is that how you used the term and understood him to, or was it about anal sex?

And, the big one, given Fords claim that the future judge and his friend Mark Judge were together in the room, laughing as Kavanaugh assaulted her:

Kavanaugh testified that The Devils Triangle was a drinking game. Is that how you used the term and understood him to, or did it mean sex between two men and one woman?

Whatever the Renate Alumni know about the party that Ford swears that she cant forget and Kavanaugh swears that he doesnt remember, those are questions they can answer, and under penalty of federal law if they knowingly and willfully... make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation.

So if agents are asking those questionsclearly material to Kavanaughs conduct and character as a teenager then and as a grown man nowtheres no political path for the handful of senators who could still possibly be swayed by the facts to support him. Just as the FBI aggressively prosecutes liars under 18 U.S.C.  1001 to discourage all the other prospective liars, the Senate would pay a price if Republicans hold together and avert their eyes after the last baby fig leaf of plausibility has been stripped from Kavanaughs naked lies before them.

Judges routinely instruct juries that, if they believe that a witness has lied about one thing they may then conclude that the witness has lied about other things.

Does anyone doubt that Kavanaugh lied about the meaning of his yearbook entries? Not as a boy or young man, but as a 53-year-old federal judge testifying under oath before the Senate in hopes of being confirmed to a seat on our highest court?

The stories remain hers and his, and cant be reconciled. If the FBI field agents doing the questioning withstand whatever political pressures and ask these obvious questions, senators will have to pick between the person whose account has so far held up and one who has plainly lied. As Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who before passing Kavanaugh out of committee on a party-line vote demanded an FBI investigation before the full Senate decides on his nomination, said of the nominee Monday night, minimizing his drinking would be one thing, but  if he lied on particular things that [are] demonstrable, then that is disqualifying.

And it would be no small poetic justice to see Kenneth Starrs dirty whisperer hoisted on the petard of his own childish sex jokes.

Unfortunately, Kavanaugh wrote as he and Starr hunted Clinton, the nature of the Presidents denials requires that the contrary evidence be set forth in graphic, even disconcerting, detail.

Now it is the nature of the would-be justices denials that require the FBI to sort through the meaning of The Devils Triangle in graphic, even disconcerting detail."
2018-08-08,Daily Beast,Catherine Oxenberg Reveals How She Lost Her Daughter to the Sex Cult NXIVM,"Long before the arrest of Keith Raniere and the summer of headlines about his alleged sex-cult consigliere Allison Mack, there was Catherine Oxenberg.

The former Dynasty star and royal descendant appeared on Megyn Kelly Today in November 2017, cementing her role as the face of the uprising against Raniere and his cult, NXIVM. Oxenberg brought the media a story that was almost too strange to be true, reporting her daughters brainwashing into a secret sorority where women were trained as slaves, branded, and forced to follow orders at the risk of punishment or public humiliation. According to court documentsand unbeknownst to many of the initiatesRaniere, aka Vanguard, was the ultimate master behind the whole operation.

In 2011, Oxenberg introduced her 19-year-old daughter, India, to NXIVMs Executive Success Programs, believing that the course would help her grow as a young entrepreneur. Over the next seven years, Oxenberg watched as India slowly transformed from an individual with dreams and aspirations of her own into an instrument and victim of Ranieres increasingly sinister machinations. In the new book Captive: A Mothers Crusade to Save Her Daughter from a Terrifying Cult, Oxenberg juxtaposes her personal journey from mother to cult buster against Raniere and NXIVMs downfall. While the book triumphantly ends with Raniere in handcuffs, Oxenberg had no idea when she began to chronicle her crusade that NXIVMs demise would soon be making headlines across the world.

In a midtown conference room Oxenberg, rushing between interviews, told The Daily Beast that Captive was initially born out of her urgent desire to share this story, even if no one was listening.

When I signed on to write a book, India was still in NXIVM, Oxenberg explained. And so it was just one more resource at my fingertips, that I could get this information out and expose this group. This was back in December, so I didnt anticipate that there were going to be arrests in March, April, and last month. I had no idea where this was going to go, if anywhere. So this might have been the only platform to expose them.

A year ago, Oxenbergs triumph was almost unimaginable. Captives prologue opens on a scene in May 2017, as Catherine confronts India about being branded. An ex-NXIVM member named Bonnie Piesse had reached out to Oxenberg to tell her about the secret sorority known as DOS, and warn her that India might be in danger. Piesse told Oxenberg that India was a member of a secret slave-master group, continuing, She signed a lifetime vow of obedience and gave damaging collateral about herself and most likely you, too. Keith puts them on starvation diets and makes them sign away their possessions, their properties, their bank accounts, and even their future children. They get punished if they dont do as theyre told.

Piesse had started to worry about India once Allison Mack singled her out for mentoring. In this master-slave club, she divulged, theres a lot of pressure for the women to sleep with Keith. [Allison Mack] must have influenced India to get close to him because thats how Alli got his approval, by bringing him women.

Fearing for her daughters safety, Oxenberg drew India away from Albanys NXIVM headquarters with the promise of a birthday party. My first line of defense was an intervention, which failed horribly, Oxenberg recalled. I did everything wrong. Then, the more information I got, I decided to reach out to law enforcement. And I hit walls. It didnt go anywhere.

Ultimately, she had to make the difficult decision to use her fame and influencethe very qualities that made the Oxenbergs such appealing NXIVM recruitsto take down the cult, almost losing her daughter in the process.

Going public was a last resort for me, she explained, because the idea of exposing my daughter at this level was horrendous, and I had an idea that it could cause permanent estrangement. India went months without speaking to her mother, and became increasingly angry with her attempts to undermine NXIVM. Still, looking back, Oxenberg exclaimed, Thank God I intervened when I did, because she could be sitting today where Allison Mack is sitting, facing 15 years to life! If I hadnt stepped in when I did, before she was potentially encouraged to do things that could have had legal repercussions... she trailed off. I feel sick to my stomach even thinking about that.

So thats why I went to the media, because I felt like if law enforcement isnt going to listen, and I really believe with every fiber of my being that laws are being broken, there are abuses that are happening, then the media was the only option that I had, because they had the power to get the attention of law enforcement. And I certainly didnt have hundreds of millions of dollars at my disposal like the Bronfmans to fight them with a legal arsenal, so I was kind of limited in what I could do. But I couldnt sit back and do nothing.

One of the main turning points in Captive is when Oxenberg suspects India of trying to recruit young women to DOS at the birthday party she threw for her. Oxenberg writes, It was heartbreaking enough that India was a danger to herself. But recruiting innocent friends to be punished, tortured, and branded? Shed crossed a moral line. And because she was doing it in my home, Id become unwittingly complicit.

The actresss personal crisis quickly escalated into a public crusade. With a growing army of NXIVM defectors by her side, Oxenberg launched a multi-pronged attack, gathering evidence and courting media attention in the hopes of pressuring law enforcement to take action. While Oxenberg played a crucial role in Keith Ranieres eventual downfall, shes reticent to take too much credit, citing a confluence of events that culminated in the recent slew of arrests. She cites the 2017 New York Times NXIVM expose as a game-changing development that almost didnt see the light of day.

Oxenberg told The Daily Beast, When I was waiting for the story to be published, it was considered to be an evergreen story. There was no push in the New York Times to publish this story. It wasnt particularly relevant. So I really think that if Me Too hadnt coincided, they may have never run the story. If you think about what the Times Union did back in 2010 and 2012, they ran this huge expose, they did run stories, and still nothing happened. And so the climate had changed drastically, thank God. Its miraculous actually, everything that had to converge for this to happen.

In Captive, Catherine Oxenberg provides cult context that goes beyond court documents and carefully-laid-out charges. In addition to being the mother of a DOS victim, Oxenberg was also enrolled in ESP herself. She quickly spotted red flags, from the creepy leader who was trailed by fawning female followers to the misogynistic underpinnings of the teachings he instilled in his students. But as she told The Daily Beast, I thought something was off, but I didnt know it was dangerous. I thought it was sort of a benign, wacky group... I didnt realize that this was a systematic, calculated process to entrap people.

Oxenberg writes about an unsettling experience she had at a Jness workshopa NXIVM spinoff group for women that Nancy Salzman, the co-founder of NXIVM, introduced her to. When Nancy divulged proudly to the class that it was Vanguard himself who had benevolently and brilliantly devised the entire Jness program to guide women, bells went off inside me like a fire alarm, Oxenberg writes. This is ridiculous! A program about female empowerment devised by a man?... The nonsense Nancy was spouting was offensive. Why not just drag us by the hair back into a prehistoric cave or something?

I hadnt been exposed to any type of misogynistic philosophy before, because that wasnt part of their main curriculum, Oxenberg told The Daily Beast. When I started to hear [Salzmans] views on women, I was shocked, because I had not had any indication of this... I thought maybe this was some weird aberration, a mistake. But not at all. They were slowly and deliberately introducing more misogyny. During one particularly revealing trip to Albany, Oxenberg was told by a NXIVM coach that, the only way to true enlightenment is by having sex with Keith.

Asked if she thought Ranieres intent was always to cultivate a group of subservient, sexually-available women, Oxenberg replied, I do. I think that, to some degree, he had been planning this all along. He just kept playing out his fantasies, and they got more and more outrageous as time went on.

In the past, NXIVM critics have been mercilessly attacked by Raniere and his lackeys. At one point in her research on NXIVM, Oxenberg writes, I discovered that Nxivm had spent more than $50 million against their critics and initiated more than fifty lawsuits, many of which the Bronfmans had either participated in or backed, targeting anyone who wrote or spoke negatively about the cult: former members, journalists, ex-girlfriendsanybody.

Oxenberg quickly found herself on the receiving end of some textbook NXIVM intimidation. I received threatening letters from a NXIVM lawyer and a state attorney general in Mexico, accusing me of numerous felonies, including fraud and extortion, Oxenberg told The Daily Beast. What was interesting for me was reading parts of the criminal complaints and some of the court documents from the prosecution, and learning that it had been Clare Bronfman and Keith in an email thread planning the demise of their enemies. So what they must have done is dispatch this task to NXIVM Mexico, because there was no lawyer in the United States who would have done this. And it just means that theyre all part and parcel of this criminal enterprise, and witness intimidation is just part of the larger scheme. Still, she offered, Every day someone else gets arrested Im less afraid.

As media coverage increased and law enforcement ramped up their investigation, Oxenberg began to fear that Raniere would order something drastic. People who had left had said that there were many teachings about suicide and honor suicide, she recalled. Then I saw Allison Mack on her social media talking about Joan of Arc and sacrificing oneself for a higher idea, and I thought, oh my God, she has so much influence over my daughter, what could that mean for India? Oxenberg continued, The most dangerous groups are these smaller ones, because theyre so tightly wound around a leader, and the more psychotic he becomes...

Simultaneously, there was the fear that India would be arrested and charged alongside Raniere, Mack, and the growing list of co-defendants. Even now, Oxenberg is loath to talk about that hypothetical outcome, saying only, I see her clearly as a victim, and I would imagine that law enforcement does too.

When Raniere finally appeared in court, Catherine Oxenberg was there: I went because I needed to see for myself that it was real. Because I had been living on so much adrenaline, for so long, so many sleepless nights. And I was so afraid on so many levelsfor my daughter, for my own safety, for my other childrenthat just to see with my own eyes that he was in chains behind bars, I was hoping it would give me a sense of closure. And did it? To some degree, yes. But Oxenberg knows that this case is far from over. There are more people that need to be held accountable, she says. I wouldnt be surprised if there was another wave of arrests, to be honest, with more superseding indictments. Because there are still people who are blatant co-conspirators who havent been charged.

And then theres the question of Allison Mack. While Captive has few kind things to say about the Smallville actress, in person, Oxenberg is compassionate toward Mack. Shes both victim and perpetrator, Oxenberg mused. And there will always be a philosophical argument about, wheres that line? And I dont have an answer for you. But there are many people who feel that theyve been traumatized by her and deceived and manipulated. So if shes broken the law, theres a price to pay for that. But at the same time, do I think that thats what she started off wanting to be a part of? No I dont. Nobody signed up for this, except Keith. Hes the only one who stood to benefit from any of this.

As for India, shes doing really well. Shes given her mother permission to be her spokesperson, and shes been very strict about what I can say.

She has written a script for me, Oxenberg told The Daily Beast, and Im not allowed to deviate from it. I cant risk another estrangement!

According to the statement, India is moving on with her life. She asks for privacy, and promises that she will share her side of the story in the near future.

She did script this, Oxenberg continued, but I wouldnt say anything that I didnt actually believe in, and she is actually doing really well, and she is a nuanced, brilliant, beautiful, young woman, who is integrating her experience, and is, in my opinion, the wiser for it.

Now, Oxenberg is taking advice from India, who asked her back in June if she could stop manipulating everything behind the scenes and go do something else instead. And I said, Im really trying! Oxenberg laughed. So the truth is, I could get a life, separate from NXIVM, and its probably good for my mental health, because I feel like Ive achieved everything I can achieve, and now its in the hands of the system. And I believe that the law will prevail, and Im very encouraged by the investigation.

Instead of attending every day of the upcoming trial, Oxenberg concluded, Ill do my best to get a life."
2018-07-14,Daily Beast,New Yorks French Restaurant Scene is Alive and Well,"Like reports of Mark Twains death being greatly exaggerated, so too have been the pronouncements of the declining popularity of French cuisine worldwide. 

Yet, New York abounds in a wide range of French restaurants with establishments both old and very, very brand new.

In the spirit of todays holiday, Bastille Day, celebrated throughout France and by Francophiles around the globe, here are some of my favorite French restaurants in New York as they have developed through the years.

This blessed time warp opened in 1960 and remains a ringer for the sort of cozy, slightly dishabille very French bistros, like the Cafe Brittany, Paris Brest, Rey and Pierre, Champlain and Bonats, that used to thrive mostly along Ninth Avenue and in the Theater District in the 1940s and 1950s. Hang your coat on the entrance rack and flip through the copies of Le Figaro stacked on a nearby table. Then choose from the huge menu replete with authentic preparations of frogs legs, escargots, pates, coq au vin, boeuf bourguignon, and, always, a choice of softly cooked sweetbreads or brains adrift in swirls of beurre noisette. The sublimely cool creme caramel is the best sign-off. While crowded for pre-theater dinners, Napoleon is more accessible for lunch.

The Upper East Side has been home to Quatorze Bis since 1990 and it is in a way a more stylish and updated Napoleon. The cafe-bistro has a smaller menu featuring many contemporary versions of classic dishes, plus a few of the houses own creations. Top choices include terrines, cassoulet in season, always choucroute garnie, saucisson de Lyon, seafood sausage, calves liver with shallots, salmon in sauce Choron and all of the desserts one has a right to expect.

Opened in 2007 by celebrity chef Daniel Boulud, this is yet an even more modern version of the Napoleon. Trimly modern at Lincoln Center it is just the right, convenient spot for remarkable charcuterie, escargots, which if not in their former dramatic presentation remain totally delicious, to be followed by a light, flavorful coq au vin and, for me, boudin noirthe chubby black blood sausage that tops creamy pureed potatoes. The dish only could be improved by serving the sausage whole instead of sliced and, sadly, thereby eliminating the luscious squoosh as knife pierces the whole casing.

Benoit is super chef Alain Ducasses take on bistro food then and now. Since 2016 it has been delectably interpreted by chef Laetitia Rouabah. The bright, quasi-art deco brasserie is a comfortable setting to choose between the Frenchiest things on the menu: charcuterie, escargots, calves liver with shallots, various cuts of steaks with all of the proper sauces and a daunting but soul-satisfying cassoulet.

Since 1962, this has been the one to beat for high-style elegance both in the flowery decor and in the impeccable food and service. Nowhere will you find better quenelles de brochet whether as appetizer or main course, potage St.-Germain, frogs legs hazy with garlic, impeccable Dover sole meuniere finished tableside, braised oxtail and poulet roti grand-mere. It also serves two of the citys best desserts: the custardy floating island that is oeufs-a la neige and any of the souffles, my favorite being the one with the orange-flavored and Cognac-based liqueur, Grand Marnier.

Le Coucou takes us sublimely into the modern era in a soaring, suavely industrial downtown setting. The kitchen is run by American chef Daniel Rose who sowed his culinary wild oats in his Paris bistro, Spring, and came home in 2016 to great acclaim. Presentations of classics and riffs on them may not look familiar, but the totally French flavors are all intact whether one orders the leeks vinaigrette with hazelnuts, terrine de veau, duck with cherries, an epic three-course rendering of lapin and any fish finished with sauce beurre blanc. And for a sweet ending, chocolate mousse and rice pudding.

The star attraction at Le Coq Rico is the rotisserie roasted chicken. The establishment opened in 2016 and is the inspiration of the Alsatian chef Antoine Westermann. Although all the chicken is delicious, it is far outclassed by the guinea hen and the boned squab braised in cabbage leaves like a miniature chartreuse. A great pate en croute or assorted grilled tidbits of chicken innards make wonderful lead-ins and side salads and potatoes complement the grilled poultry. But leave room for the larger than life mille-feuille (A.K.A. Napoleon) or the chefs version of the classic floating island.

Frenchette opened four months ago and has become the most celebrated new kid in town. Chefs Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr who guided Keith McNallys famous bistros, Balthazar, Pastis and Augustine, are on their own in a trim art deco brasserie setting. The Frenchiest dishes on the menu include a most remarkable blanquette de lapin (the lean tender chunks of rabbit immersed in a creamy sauce along with earthy morels and silky egg noodles). Other neo-classics include soupe de poissons, guinea hen pate, creamy scrambled eggs brouillade nested with snails, duck frites, calves liver and perfect creme caramel."
2018-02-24,Daily Beast,Historys Hot in TV and MoviesDoes It Matter if Its True,"Theres a reason why some of the most successful TV dramas and filmsmost recently, The Crown and The Darkest Houroffer a mix of fact and fiction in portraying history. Or why historical novelson the surface, an oxymoronic genreremain immensely popular.

When done well, those hybrid creations both entertain and enlighten, allowing viewers and readers to vicariously accompany their protagonists as they struggle with the tumultuous events of their eras. But when done badly, they can be woefully misleading, especially at a time when many peoples knowledge of history is based almost solely on such forms of entertainment.

As someone who writes nonfiction books about World War II and the Third Reich but who also wrote a novel about Hitlers early years, I realize it would be folly to try to spell out any set of rules to encourage the former while discouraging the latter. Yet I also believe that that those who produce or write these dramas have a responsibility to ground them in a strong, intellectually honest sense of history, even while taking liberties with their settings and characters. Its then up to viewers and readers to judge the extent to which they succeed or fail in doing so.

Two earlier examples illustrate the range of possibilities. In 1978, the NBC miniseries The Holocaust riveted not just American but also German viewers with its vivid portrayal of a Jewish family and an ambitious lawyer who turns into a SS mass murderer. While trials of Nazi perpetrators had already played a significant role in sparking debates about the legacy of the Third Reich, particularly among students, this TV drama was a catalyst for a broader self-examination of German society. The older generation, which had been prone to avoid any discussion of their behavior during the Nazi era, could no longer remain silent.

At the opposite end of the spectrum is Oliver Stones 1991 film JFK. This is not historical fiction but pure fiction masquerading as history, buttressed by skillful cinematic touches to give it the feel of something akin to a documentary. Coming away from Stones film, the uninformed viewer is left with the impression that Vice President Lyndon Johnson, along with a cabal of other sinister figures, masterminded Kennedys assassination so that Johnson could take Kennedys placealthough theres not a shred of evidence to support such a conspiracy theory.

Stone did not present his film as an alternate history but as the true story. Someone I met after a screening tried to argue that, even if unsubstantiated, it presented a larger truth. You cant get more intellectually dishonest than that.

The Crown, by comparison, is largely a product of solid historical research, chronicling real events while embellishing some of them and inventing the intimate conversations between Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip that are impossible to check. It works so well because the imagined partseven a fictional character like Churchills favorite young secretary Venetia Scott during Londons deadly smog of 1952fit convincingly into the narrative.

But in the case of The Darkest Hour, the highly acclaimed film about Churchills handling of the fall of France and the defense of his country in 1940, the imaginary distorts rather than illuminates the basic story. Theres the scene of Churchill taking a ride in the Tube with the passengers urging him to fight Hitler. Its not so much the fact that Churchill never set foot in the Tube during this period thats bothersome; its that it implies that he needed this kind of pep talk from ordinary people to steel his resolve. Or that he needed a similar pep talk from King George, when in reality it was Churchill who skillfully brought the monarch, who had earlier supported his predecessor Neville Chamberlains policy of appeasement, over to his side.

As a result, Gary Oldmans skillful portrayal of an initially vacillating, at times doddering Churchill misses the mark. By contrast, Steven Spielbergs The Post strikes only an occasional false note. For example, there are the admiring women who line up to glimpse Katharine Graham, The Washington Post publisher, as she emerges from the Supreme Court after it issued its verdict in the Pentagon papers case in 1971. In fact, Graham left the hearing almost unnoticed since this was long before she became a feminist icon. But as my former Post company colleagues can attest, Meryl Streep turns in an uncannily convincing performance as Graham, capturing her personality and mannerisms as well as her growing resolve in the midst of her newspapers first defining moment.

Not all movies and novels should be judged by their broad historical accuracy, so long as they are not attempting to fool viewers and readers into believing they are presenting an accurate version of events. Quentin Tarantinos huge hit Inglourious Basterds tells the story of Jewish G.I.s and a French Jewish woman assassinating Hitler and other top Nazi leaders in occupied France. Audiences loved it, knowing full well that this was pure fantasy. (In the interest of full disclosure, my novel Last Stop Vienna imagined an earlier alternate ending for Hitler, too.) Robert Harriss Fatherland, published in 1992, is a masterful novel set in Berlin after Germany wins World War II.

But such ventures into counterfactual history are more the exceptions than the rule. Harris, for instance, has since produced a string of historical novelsamong them, Conclave, Pompeii and Enigmathat have established the British writer as the current champion of this genre. His latest offering, Munich, displays his talent for taking a well-known event like the 1938 Munich conference, placing his fictional characters in real settings with the main protagonists like Chamberlain and Hitler, and producing a compelling read.

The key ingredient of Harris success is his palpable fascination and detailed knowledge of the historical events and settings of all his books. In Munich, the plot itselfthe effort by a German foreign ministry official to alert his former Oxford classmate, a member of the British delegation to Munich, to Hitlers allegedly secret plans for further conquestis hardly startling; any reader of Mein Kampf would be familiar with those plans already. But Harris infuses his story with insights into the doomed British and French efforts to reason with Hitler, which was like watching an unarmed passerby trying to persuade a madman to hand over his gun. And with the anguish of his main German character as he tries to persuade the British to stand up to Hitler, explaining how his country is now in the grips of the power of unreason.

For many writers, the attraction of historical fiction is that it allows them to spin more than a good yarn: they can convey the atmosphere of an era. Alan Furst, the American author of spy novels like The Polish Officer, Dark Voyage, and A Hero of France, takes the prize for vividly conjuring up the shadowy atmosphere of prewar and wartime Europe.

The other attraction of historical fiction is the opportunity it offers writers to explore the psyches and choices of their characters. William Shirer, the acclaimed journalist and author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, wrote The Traitor, a largely forgotten novel about an American expat who becomes a propagandist for Nazi Germany. Shirers nonfiction is far more powerful, but his novel demonstrates his fascination with those Americans he encountered in Berlin who had gone to the other sidebut whose motives and background were often shrouded in mystery.

Simon Sebag Montefiore, the British author of hefty nonfiction works such as Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar and The Romanovs: 1613-1918, has been more successful pursuing a parallel track as a novelist. His last installment of what he calls his Moscow trilogy, Red Sky at Noon, tells the story of Benya Golden, a Russian Jew who emerges from the Gulag to join a penal battalion of Cossacks during the battle for Stalingrad in 1942. His near-miraculous escapes require a suspension of disbelief at times. But the horrific conditions and desperation of those who were thrown into these penal battalions and sent on suicide missions is based on the historical record that Montefiore has expertly chronicled in his nonfiction.

If theres any doubt on that score, Montefiore includes an authors note about Fiction and Fact, sorting out the two in his novel. Thats not a requirement for a historical novel or film but it certainly adds to its credibility. And a measure of credibility is, ultimately, what good historical fiction is all about."
2018-10-26,Daily Beast,Bolton Kept DHS in the Dark in His Push to Seal the Border Against the Migrant Caravan,"National Security Adviser John Bolton championed a plan to send U.S. troops to the southern border to keep migrants out, two senior administration officials told The Daily Beast.

After rejecting a proposal by the Department of Homeland Security to enlist the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to set up migrant camps in Mexico, Bolton shared his thoughts directly with a like-minded Donald Trump, cutting out Homeland Security Chief Kirstjen Nielsen and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, the officials told The Daily Beast.

Senior officials in the administration are concerned that the president is frustrated that we dont have a viable solution at the border, a third official said, in defense of Bolton.

Bolton shared few details about his talks with Trump with White House officials or cabinet secretaries, according to two officials.

The third official insisted Bolton did not come up with the military plan on his own, but was executing the commander in chiefs wishes, which the president expressed last week in a tweet threatening to call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!

It was Boltons initial refusal to share details about his West Wing discussions with Kelly that caused the pairs shouting match, previously reported by Bloomberg News and confirmed by two of the officialsthough one of the officials said Kelly did the bulk of the shouting.

All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe sensitive West Wing discussions.

Kelly was so furious after the heated discussions with Bolton and other officials that he left the White House for the rest of the day to cool off, two of the officials said.

John Bolton is yelling fire in the crowded movie theater that is Trumps mind, one of the officials added.

In the lead-up to Novembers midterm election, the Trump administration has floated measures on potential closure or further militarization of the southern border. Earlier this week, the San Francisco Chronicle and NBC News reported on a drafted executive action that would make it exceedingly difficult for asylum seekers traveling from Central America to enter at the U.S.-Mexico border.

DHS Secretary Nielsen, an ally of Kellys, last week proposed asking UNHCR to set up camps inside Mexico, and to enlist Mexicos help in convincing migrants to go to those camps, but Bolton thought that plan was unworkable, two of the officials said.

He then went dark on his discussions with the president, which frustrated those well versed on border issues who wanted to ensure the administration didnt repeat its botched rollout last year of Trumps travel ban. Bolton has attended only a few of the dozens of senior-level meetings the National Security Council has held on the border issue this year, two of the officials said.

No one from the administration had approached the UNHCR with the DHS proposal, but the Mexican government had requested that they help support access to the Mexican asylum system by individuals fleeing violence and persecution, spokesperson Chris McGrath emailed Friday. This includes working to increase and improve the shelter spaces available for individuals who are applying for asylum.

A West Wing official told The Daily Beast that one reason Bolton didnt want to share his plan widely was his ongoing campaign to clamp down on leaks to the press. This official noted the rich irony of that rationale resulting in leaks to The Daily Beast.

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis was not part of the discussions, but has provided a plan to deploy several hundred troops in line with Boltons desires. Bolton has complained to Trump that Mattis has slow-rolled responding in the past, two current and one former senior administration official said.

That came after Mattis responded to a request for border reinforcements from DHS, according to a source briefed on the evolving border plan, who said the retired general had not approved everything the department had asked for. In particular, DHS had wanted more direct military support for Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) functions like detention operations.

Instead, the military plan would provide aid with planning, engineering, and logistics, including fixed-wing and helicopter transportation for CBP, which would result in a less militarized border than administration hawks desire.

Boltons secretive, go-it-alone approach to border policy is markedly different from that of his predecessor, retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. One of the officials said that McMaster used to hold phone calls on Tuesdays and Fridays with most of the cabinet secretaries on the line, so that they could discuss matters and feel heard.

The NSC, the Pentagon, and Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did McMasters spokesperson.

He was a really good honest broker. The day Bolton started in the job, the phone calls stopped, the official told The Daily Beast, adding that now it can take days for cabinet secretaries to get on Boltons calendar to hash out issues.

A senior administration official pushed back, saying Bolton met with Mattis early in his tenure and that Mattis requested that he hold fewer national security council meetings, adding that Bolton has regular in-person meetings with cabinet officials, and a weekly breakfast with Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo."
2018-08-25,Daily Beast,Trump Changed Washington DC People Now Stab Each Other in The Front,"For Trumps Team of Enemies there is nothing more satisfying than seeing a rival vanquished and then being able to comment on it in the immediate aftermath.

But unlike other administrations, where the misfortunes of colleagues are gossiped about behind the scenes, Team Trump prefers to stab each other in the front. After all, its more personal that way.

After a colleague is fired, charged with a crime, or otherwise smitten by fate, their former colleagues have routinely taken to Twitter or television to dole out sick burns on said persons political corpse.

The latest was Corey Lewandowski who appeared on NPR hours after former Trump fixer/lawyer/ guy who he didnt know very well, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to tax fraud and campaign finance violations.

Well, I know Michael Cohen very well. I ran the campaign, Lewandowski said. Michael has been a serial liar for the last...three years that I've known him.

His bloodthirst not quite quenched, Lewandowski then let Paul Manafortwho helped push Lewandowski out of the campaignhave it too.

I think that justice was served today with the Manafort convictions,  he said.

Its a culture that, of course, comes from the top. Because no one loves to kick a perceived enemy when they are down more than the President of the United States.

This week it was Cohen who drew Trumps ire. Previously it was former FBI agent Peter Strzok. Others who received mean tweets in the wake of bad news or tough career decisions include former FBI director James Comey, former FBI deputy director Andrew  McCabe, Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Bob Corker (R-TN) and former Trump aide Sam Nunberg.

The practice dates back to the early days of the Trump campaign, before Trump won the Republican election.

When Lewandowski was fired after a series of missteps including grabbing a female reporter, lying about it and getting caught on tape lying about it, then-Trump adviser Michael Caputo tweeted Ding dong the witch is dead! complete with GIF of the Wicked Witch of the East, striped socks and ruby red slippers (Caputo quickly resigned from the campaignbut the tweet remains).

The street fighting continued through the transition. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was unceremoniously booted from the transition after, he said, Jared Kushner, then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon united against him.

This may have been the second round of previous brawl as Christie had put Kushners dad in jail. But then came round three. After Bannon was fired in August 2017, Christie did a victory lap.

Now that he has been fired, no one is going to care about anything else Steve Bannon has to say, Christie told PBS Newshour. [T]his I suspect is his last 15 minutes of fame. I hope he enjoys it.

The hits have come from the podium as well.

After Omarosa Manigault Newmans dramatic exit from the administration, White House spokesman Raj Shah was ready for questions about her departure, complete with a witty dig.

""Omarosa was fired three times on The Apprentice and this was the fourth time we let her go,"" Shah said. ""She had limited contact with the president while here. She has no contact now.""

Sometimes the public burying is done accidentally. Anthony Scaramucci, Trumps communications director for 10 days, famously burned a whole slew of staffers in a profanity-laced New Yorker tirade. He thought it was off-the-record but never bothered to check first. That particular saga was different from the others for one major reason.  The Mooch attacked his colleagues while he, and they, were still in their job. But not for long.

Scaramucci was soon fired. He has since tried to be diplomatic with respect to his former colleagues. He indicated that Bannon should be fired days before he eventually was. But one of the only departures that Scaramucci has publicly celebrated was that of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who had quit when he heard Scaramucci had been hired.

During an interview on The View in September 2017, Scaramucci told the hosts he referred to Spicer as Liar Spice. Spicer, for his part, declined to celebrate Scaramuccis departure during one of his myriad TV hits since leaving his post.

I don't think it's right to relish in somebody else's problems, Spicer told Jimmy Kimmel in an interview a few months after Scaramuccis stint as communications director came to an end. And so I just as a person, I don't think that's right. But again, I think it proved my point. And that to do this job is one in which you have to have the proper background.""

Instead, he opted for a much more Beltway approach when throwing daggers: he delivered them in a book lamenting his rivals betrayal of Donald Trump, Reince Priebus and the good people who were to serve under him.

What had originally stopped Scaramucci from getting a coveted White House job was the approval of a government office in the Department of Treasury to sell his company to a Chinese conglomerate, Spicer wrote. Months after his brief stint, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States... still did not approve the sale, and the Chinese conglomerate pulled out of the deal."
2018-07-31,Daily Beast,No Rudy Trump Isnt Othello Hes Iago,"At eight oclock Monday morning, Rudy Giuliani was already on television talking all manner of nonsense on behalf of his client Donald Trump.

In a full-court press that seemed calculated to make our eyes pop nearly as often as his, Giuliani declared it was incumbent on Robert Mueller to explain a tweet from the president referencing a conflict of interest that should have led the special counsel to recuse.

What conflict? Giuliani didnt say. Ask Mueller.

Why should he have to explain Trumps tweets? CNNs Alisyn Camerota replied. Because he has the conflict, Giuliani explained in the slightly impatient tone of someone forced to say something obvious weve come to expect whenever he says something manifestly untrue, idiotic, or both.

The purpose of Mondays interviews seemed to be to square his previous comments about Trump fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen, whom at one point Monday Americas mayor called Bob.

Earlier this summer, Giuliani had praised Cohen as honest. Now he was calling him a liar. Asked about this shift, Giuliani babbled that George Washington would have said that about Benedict Arnold at a certain point in time. As for the president? Cohen had betrayed Trump like Iago betrayed Othello and Brutus put the last knife into Caesar.

Actually, Iago doesnt so much betray Othello as he sets out to destroy him: Theres no question of loyalty or fidelity, so theres no element of Iago turning on Othello, as Trump clearly feels Cohen is doing.

Nor does Iago ever betray Othello in the sense of ratting him out, as Cohen seems to be threatening to do to Trump. What Iago does, essentially, is to prank Othello into ruination. By means of an elaborate series of lies and deceptions, Othello is duped into committing a soul-destroying act with permanent consequences. So the Othello comparison doesnt really hold up.

Still, it was amusing to hear the bone-spurs president likened to two consummate soldiers, The Moor of Venice and the dictator who brought about the end of the Roman Republic.

It was interesting to me to hear Trumps lawyer invoke Othello, particularly the morning after watching the third episode of Sacha Baron Cohens Who Is America?

On my bedside table is a book that I took down not long after the 2016 election that contains an essay in which the poet W.H. Auden analyzes the character of Iago in terms of the figure of the practical joker. There are, Auden argues, two types of pranksters in the world, both of whom disrupt the normal convention that makes social interaction possible: the idea that, absent some reason, we can rely on people who tell us something to be speaking the truth.

If a stranger tries to sell me shares in a gold mine, I shall be a fool if I do not check up on his statements before parting with my money; and if another tells me that he has talked with little men who came out of a flying saucer, I shall assume that he is crazy. But if I ask a stranger the way to the station, I shall assume that his answer is truthful to the best of his knowledge, because I cannot imagine what motive he could have for misdirecting me.

Common sense and experience prepare us for the mountebank and the madman. What nothing prepares us for is the prankster, the person who lies and dissembles for no apparent reason. That there are such amoral people, and that Iago is one, is the proposition that Auden sets out to explore.

The first type of practical joker Auden describes is one whose purpose is to expose some flaw in society which is a hindrance to a real community or brotherhood.

He references a number of characters in Shakespeare who have baroque tricks played on them and the friends and associates who punk them with playacting. (Think of Falstaff and Malvolio, who would be pranked into self-knowledge if they were better people.)

In fact, though, Auden seems too to be eerily anticipating our own satirist prankster, for this, surely, is what Sacha Baron Cohen is doing when he gulls a sitting or would-be legislator into doing or saying something that should surpass beliefinto, say, literally exposing himself while he shouts obscenities and racist abuse.

He is, in Audens words, de-intoxicating them from their illusions while, at the same time, unmasking the venality and stupidity that leads us to put our government into the hands of these stupid and venal men. Sacha Baron Cohen, with his playacting and his elaborate schemes of moral revelation, is arguably a bit of an Iago.

But its the second class of practical joker Auden defines that sent me back to this essay, one in whom the impulse to deceive is not purposeful but chronic, who cannot interact with people without manipulating them or dissembling in some way. This kind of fraudster makes fools of people not in order to teach a moral lesson but because its the only way he can feel alive.

The success of the practical joker depends upon his accurate estimate of the weaknesses of others, their ignorances, their social reflexes, their unquestioned presuppositions, their obsessive desires... But, in most cases, behind the jokers contempt for others lies something else, a feeling of self-insufficiency, of a self lacking in authentic feelings and desires of its own. The normal human being may have a fantastic notion of himself, but he believes in it... The practical joker despises his victims, but at the same time he envies them because their desires, however childish and mistaken, are real to them, whereas he has no desire which he can call his own. His goal, to make game of others, makes his existence absolutely dependent upon theirs; when he is alone, he is a nullity.

If anyone in the Trump universe resembles Iago it is not the slow-talking, mouth-breathing Cohen, the fixer stooge, but Trump himself, the huckster politician. Like Iago, Trump is forever brooding over some perceived injury or injusticeon the part of the press, the Democrats, the Mexicans, the liberals, the FBI, the people from shithole countries who want to come here. Like Iago he is perpetually at war with a world that perversely fails to appreciate his value and worth. And, like Iago, Trump interacts with others almost entirely for the purpose of causing strife, whether among his staff or the electorate.

And just as Iagoand Richard III, for that matterenact scenes in which they invent scenarios and speak in voices quite unlike their own, Trump stages pageants: on a grand scale at his campaign rallies, and in a sort of mega-miniature on Twitter, some days speaking in his own untempered words in his own unmodulated voice, and at other times handing off his Twitter account to people who manage to sound more like a grown-up and are able to vary their sentence structure and tone.

One of the points that Auden makes in his essay on Iago (its called The Joker in the Pack) is that unlike the criminal, whose deception can never be revealed, the joker lives to reveal his malfeasance.

What distinguishes his actions from those of the criminal is that, even when they have something tangible to gain, this is a secondary satisfaction; their primary satisfaction is the infliction of suffering on others, or the exercise of power over others against their will.

He cannot truly prove his genius and power without letting his victims know that they have been duped. I think weve come to the point, now, where the conversations and arguments that have been our national pastime for so longabout Trumps motives, his actions, the intent and impulses behind his words, his state of mind, his state of health, and the degree to which he is or is not phenomenally smart or phenomenally stupidare winding down. No one cares anymore. We just want it to be over.

Trump actually spans both kinds of fraud-monger. He isnt a moralist or a satirist, but hes both a criminal and the sort of prankster who lies and deceives because its the only way he has of relating to other people. So theres a part of him that wants to get away with what he does and a part that wants people to know how much hes gotten away with.

Thats the tension were all seeing and feeling, the wild inconsistencies in his behavior from one day to the next. Its hard, very hard, not knowing which side will win out."
2018-09-12,Daily Beast,Top GOP Campaign Official I Had No Idea My Top Recruit Jim Hagedorn Made These Crazy Remarks,"The head of House Republicans campaign arm said he was entirely unaware, until asked by reporters last week, that one of his top recruits celebrated the death of a political opponent, made sexist remarks about others, and offered a host of other offensive comments in his stint as a political blogger.

Jim Hagedorn is the Republican nominee in Minnesotas first congressional district, a prime Republican pickup opportunity and one that National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) has described as a national bellwether.

It will be Hagedorns fourth House run. His previous efforts have been marred by a long stream of highly controversial and offensive remarks he made between 2002 and 2012 on his now-defunct website, Mr. Conservative.

Hagedorn infamously dubbed Washingtons two U.S. senators, both women, undeserving bimbos in tennis shoes. He wrote that Harriet Miers nomination to the Supreme Court was an effort to fill the bra of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor. He dubbed a former House Republicans alleged abuse victim, white trash; called Indian reservations casino parlors and redistribution of wealth centers; and suggested that former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) bucked his party on the Iraq War due to his Jewish faith.

In his Election 2002 Masterpiece Analysis, Hagedorn wrote: Good news from Hawaii, Pasty Mink is still dead. Bad news from Hawaii, some other communist will win her congressional seat. On election night 2008, he predicted that Barack Obamas victory would usher in mass migration from his second country of Kenya.

The Hagedorn campaign pointed to the fact he has since apologized for many of the remarks on that site, saying in a statement during his 2014 congressional run, some of my hard-hitting and tongue-in-cheek commentary was less than artfully constructed or included language that could lead to hurt feelings. I offer a sincere and heartfelt apology.

But this cycle, in the age of Donald Trump, hes taken a more combative tone. If someone wants to run a political correctness and identity politics campaign against us, he told Roll Call last month, well see what happens.

The NRCC hasnt been turned off by the bring-it-on-approach. The committee named Hagedorn to its Young Guns fundraising program last week. Its a program that trains and recruits aspiring legislators who pass a series of rigorous goals and surpassed program benchmarks. But that vetting apparently did not include informing Stivers of Hagedorns history of inflammatory comments.

At a press event last week hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, Stivers was asked about some of those past, inflammatory comments.

That is news to me, he said. Ill go back and look at his blog...[T]hats all news to me and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention.

In a statement to The Daily Beast on Tuesday, Maddie Anderson, a spokeswoman for the NRCC, called Hagedorns remarks inappropriate.

We in no way condone these inappropriate remarks, Anderson said. The NRCC encourages all candidates to focus on the issues voters in their district care about.

Hagedorns comments werent exactly hidden from public view. In fact, they earned local and some national media coverage during his previous congressional runs. A couple weeks before Stivers admitted his ignorance of Hagedorns writings, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee posted online a public copy of its research book on the candidate, which runs over 100 pages and includes excerpts from his most outlandish comments.

Those comments also included a defense of Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO), who lost his 2012 challenge to Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) after suggesting that women could not get pregnant from legitimate rape. On his blog, Hagedorn wrote, during this entire incident, the only actual rape that took place was the one Inside-the-Beltway establishment Republicans inflicted upon Akin.

In 2006, he described a woman who accused then-Rep. Don Sherwood (R-PA) of choking her when giving her a back rub as white trash.

To set the stage, Metropolitan DC police officers are called to [Former Representative] Sherwoods Hill House apartment, based upon a complaint that a Congressman is attempting to illegally dispose of his white trash, Hagedorn wrote.

Hagedorn also strenuously criticized a landmark 2003 Supreme Court decision, Lawrence vs. Texas, that struck down laws making homosexual conduct illegal. Justices not named Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas felt compelled to nullify a dwindling number of rarely enforced morals laws by which States, in essence, prohibited two-way traffic in tunnels constructed by God and marked by nature as exit only, Hagedorn wrote.

Those and other controversial comments dont appear to have sidetracked Hagedorns campaign thus far. There have been few polls conducted in the district, but a recent internal Hagedorn campaign poll showed him with a 14-point lead over his Democratic opponent, teacher and Army veteran Dan Feehan, according to a local news report. (Internal polls are, to be clear, notoriously unreliable).

But Feehan does enjoy a decent fundraising lead, having brought in more than $1.1 million to Hagedorns $850,000.

Hagedorn is hoping to replace retiring Rep. Tim Walz (D-MN), who bested Hagedorn in general election contests in 2014 and 2016 and is now running for governor.

Hagedorn also ran for the seat in 2010, but failed to secure the Republican nomination during that cycle. His campaign website plays down that and other losses. Hagedorns back-to-back-to-back campaigns follow successful similar efforts undertaken by former Minnesota Congressman John Kline, current Minnesota Congressman Collin Peterson and former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, it notes."
2018-07-19,Daily Beast,Rick Scott PACs Massive Fundraising Haul Gets a Controversial Assist,"This story originally appeared in The Daily Beast newsletter, Pay Dirt. Sign up for that newsletter: HERE.

Florida Gov. Rick Scotts has built a behemoth fundraising operation in his bid to unseat Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL), including the backing of a super PAC, New Republican PAC, that reported having more than $7 million in contributions in the second quarter.

But two contributions in the PACs latest quarterly fundraising report could cause more headaches than theyre worth. They reveal financial support for Scotts Senate bid by a doctor and former health executive with a long and controversial history, involving allegations of kickbacks, financial conflicts of interest, and tens of millions of dollars in settlements with U.S. Justice Department.

The May 8 contributions came on from Theriac Management Associates LLC, which donated $60,000, and TEM LLC, which chipped in $10,000. State incorporation records list Daniel Dosoretz as an executive of both companies. Dosoretz is the former chairman and CEO of 21st Century Oncology, a Fort Myers, Florida, company that emerged from bankruptcy earlier this year.

Dosoretz was a key player in whistleblower allegations brought by the former chairman of Broward Health, a state public health system. That whistleblower, David DiPietro, alleged that Billy Rubin, a lobbyist close to Scott, used series of threats and kickbacks in an attempt to steer state money to 21st Century Oncology. As part of the scheme, DiPietro alleged, Dosoretz put political pressure on a Broward Health executive and bragged about his close friendship with Scott. On another occasion, DiPietro claimed, Rubin invoked Dosoretzs financial support for Scott, suggesting that his campaign contributions would be useful in securing business for 21st Century Oncology. In the months before a multi-billion-dollar contract at the center of the allegations was awarded to the company, 21st Century Oncology orchestrated payments to Governor Scotts campaign, inauguration, and Lets Get to Work Committee in excess of $400,000, DiPietro alleged.

At the time that contract was awarded, Scott had a stakeby way of a blind trustin investment partnerships run by a private equity firm that owned 21st Century Oncology.

DiPietros qui tam whistleblower complaint, filed on behalf of the federal government, was stayed when 21st Century Oncology filed for bankruptcy in 2017. It has not resumed since then. A bankruptcy judge subsequently threw out DiPietros efforts to persist in his False Claims Act and anti-kickback statute claims, saying he hadnt marshalled sufficient evidence for the charges in the context of bankruptcy proceedings.

But DiPietros allegations werent the only charges levied against the company. In December, 21st Century Oncology paid $26 million to settle False Claims Act allegations and charges of illegal kickbacks stemming from illicit financial relationships with doctors that referred patients to the company. On the same day, it paid a $2.3 million fine over a 2015 data breach that impacted more than two million patients. In 2015 and 2016, the company settled an additional $54 million claim over its billing of federal health care programs for medically-unnecessary procedures.

Those settlements and legal costs contributed to the financial woes that drove 21st Century Oncology into bankruptcy. Dosoretz resigned from the companys board in early 2017, but his support for Scotts political endeavors has persisted.

And hes not the only New Republican PAC donor to draw scrutiny for his financial relationship with Scott. Other contributors to the group include a pair of companies that received more than $250 million in investment commitments from Floridas state pension fund."

2018-10-05,Daily Beast,Bradley Coopers Thing for Lady Gagas Nose in A Star Is Born Is More Creepy Than Cute,"I took my big nose to see A Star Is Born, Bradley Coopers directorial debut and Lady Gaga's coming-out party/film debut. As The Daily Beasts Kevin Fallon wrote in his review, its everything youd want it to be.

Its splashy: As Ally, Gaga belts the films theme song, Shallow, through her nasal cavity, destining it for high school recital glory.

Its serious: Cooper, as Jackson, mumbles through his beard, complaining about pop music like Waylon Jennings at an unlimited lunch buffet.

Its star-studded: Dave Chappelle, Halsey, Alec Baldwin, and Sam Elliott all make appearances. (Even the dog the couple adopts togetherplayed by Charlie, Coopers real-life poochacts his tail off.)

But theres one supporting actor that A Star Is Born fails: Lady Gagas nose. The genre-crossing filmdrama, romance, remake, concert documentarycan also be described as two and a half hours of schnoz porn.

Gaga and Cooper bump noses on the films poster. Unlike past onscreen couples, the pair doesnt dance onstage cheek to cheek, but snout to snout. Cooper, who directed the film, has a penchant for close-ups that direct eyes straight toward Gagas... you guessed it.

One particularly egregious moment of objectification comes just moments after Jackson has met Ally. Shes a waitress and part-time lounge singer whose aquiline nose has kept her from finding the kind of fame her talent deserves.

When she confesses this to Jackson, he tells her that he loves her nose, leeringly drawls about how hell be thinking about it all night. As she fingers her feature, he reaches over and strokes her nose himself.

The lighting is red; the music is sexy (Whipping Post by the Allman Brothers). Ally takes the gesture in, batting her bedroom eyes as a mana famous one at thataffirms the nose thats kept her star from rising.

As Rachel Syme wrote in The New York Times, Its an arresting moment, in which she seems both receptive and completely assured. David Fears Rolling Stone review marveled at the fact that the film, [convinces] you [Gagas] Roman nose is Public Erogenous Zone No. 1.

But heres the thingits not a public park, its Allys face. Jacksons tracing of it shows his entitlement knows no bounds. He claims Ally at first sight. While Jackson tells Ally he's going to touch her nose, he doesn't quite ask permission. And he doesn't have to. Ask Trump: When youre a star, they let you do it.

Jackson fawns over Allys biggest insecurity. Any woman who has sat through a date with a man going on about how much he loves her big nose, curvy hips, or prominent lisp might see through his attempt at grooming her.

Ally, unfortunately, does not. Its obvious shes insecure, and she eagerly gobbles up the crumbs of attention Jackson leaves for her. So what if this man is a vitriolic drunk who passes out mid-makeout? Hes made it clear: The world may call her ugly, but shes beautiful to him. Leave him, and say goodbye to the validation.

I can not HW-AH-AH-AH with abandon, like Ally does in one raucous concert scene. But save for the whole talent thing, she and my younger self werent too different. Ally, like me, and so many mousey girls before us, keeps a copy of Carole Kings Tapestry over her bed. I remember the song Beautiful racking up plays in my iTunes library, its message cemented in my teenage consciousness: if you smile more, boys will like you.

Even as Jackson becomes seismically undateablegoing on benders, criticizing her music, embarrassing both of them onstage as Ally wins a Grammyshe, in great country tradition, stands by her man.

Midway through the film, during a pivotal fight scene, Jackson calls Ally fucking ugly. (While shes naked, no less!) This one line suggests that Jackson has been manipulating Ally the whole time. Its the path of least resistance to really hurting her. He knows calling her ugly and threatening to take his attention away will terrify her, because he set up their relationship to hinge on his approval.

This pattern of abuse all started with that damn nose stroke, and Cooper, the films director/chief schnoz-toucher, packages it as a meet-cute. Its not. Its part of a strategic negging that renders Ally emotionally dependent on Jacksons approval.

A Star Is Born was filmed in the spring of 2017, before #MeToo, and it shows. If it were shot today, as the movements simmer has reached a rage-filled boiling point, the script might not have called for Jacksons nose caress. Or, if it did, perhaps Allys nose could have delivered a little electric shock in response. Anything that says: My schnoz, hands off."

2018-08-07,Daily Beast,Why Iranian Ex-Tyrant Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Invoked Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf to Troll Trump,"Whats the weirdest tweet you can possibly imagine? Is it weirder than ex-Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad praising Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf in the same tweet?

No? Yeah, of course not. And the weirdest single thing about it is completely in the eye of the beholder. Is it the fact that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the guy who once stood in front of the UN and said the United States was probably responsible for the 9/11 attacks, appears to have enough opinions about basketball to know who Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf is? Does he really follow the NBA? I mean, it wouldnt be insaneits a very popular product worldwide and theres an Iranian center currently on the Miami Heat roster. Or is he just pandering to get some licks in on Trump after his insanely stupid LeBron tweet? If he is pandering, isnt it pretty goddamn weird that Ahmadinejad, a politician even if he is an extremely weird and dangerous one, is making room for this stuff in his feed, which usually hosts tweets like this...

...and this celebration of mid-2000s pains in George W. Bushs ass...

...for snarky commentary about Trump going full racist on LeBron because the president was watching CNN late at night and saw Bron say something negative about him? Is the moment that were living in, you and me and everyone who uses a computer and is inundated day after day with snarky Trump own after snarky Trump own, is it really so damn powerful that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the former president of Iran, a dude who said that AIDS was engineered by the West to torment poor countries, is driven to perform in this dance that half of America does with slumped shoulders and vomit dribbling out of their mouths? Is this just what politics is right now, no matter where you are, no matter what phase of your career youre in?

And then, of course, theres the matter of the players he selected. Certainly, LeBron and MJ, that makes sense. Theyre extremely good at basketball and they were both mentioned in Trumps asinine tweet about how Don Lemon wasnt smart, or something.

But... Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf? I mean, sure, he was a man before his time; an off-the-dribble three-point shooter living in a world that didnt understand what he was doing out there, worthy of reminiscence by backward-looking sports dorks the world over. Phil Jackson once bizarrely compared Steph Curry to him. And sure, hes a Muslim, thats got something to do with it, but its not like Islam is exotic in the NBA. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, maybe the best basketball player to ever live, was a man of the Five Pillars. Hakeem Olajuwon fasted during Ramadan every year, playing professional basketball games on an empty stomach as an expression of his faith. Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic, Nets forward Kenneth Faried, and Knicks center Enes Kanter practice Islam and currently ply their trade in the league.

Abdul-Rauf wasnt just a Muslim, however. He was also a shit-stirrer. In 1996, he sat in the locker room during performances of the American national anthem. At first no one noticed, but eventually a reporter did and asked him why. He said the flag represents oppression to him, he said that his faith told him to resist oppression, and he said that he didnt criticize anyone who stood for the anthem, and so everyone should leave him alone.

They didnt. The NBA, unlike the NFL, a stupid-ass league run by short-sighted, greedy weirdos, put a clause in the CBA concerning conduct during the anthem, and told Rauf he had to stand. The union and the league eventually sorted out a compromise: Rauf would be allowed to stand with his hands raised and his eyes closed, the traditional stance of prayer in Islam, and he would be hit with a fine for previous incidents.

But it didnt just end there. American sports leagues, as we see in the Kaepernick saga, are tinderboxes where this shit is concerned. A little spark of dissension in the locker room creates raging fires of public grievance. Being nonconformist about the anthem really pisses people off. God only knows why this applies to sports and not every other aspect of American public life, which are all struck through with healthy irreverence. Maybe its the audience. Maybe it's the thicket of commercial ties that every sports team needs to turn a fatty profit.

Letters to the editor of the Denver Post spelled out peoples feelings on the matter pretty clearly: That Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf wont stand when the national anthem is played shows a disgusting lack of respect for the millions of people of all races and religions who do respect and value their citizenship in this country. Maybe he should consider relocating to some other country, maybe one that doesn't have a national anthem.

Woody Paige, the longtime Denver Post sports columnist and a current panelist on ESPNs Around the Horn, was fairly civil about Raufs protest for a while, even complimentary (one column about the topic ends with the extremely-sports-columnist couplet: By sitting down, Abdul-Rauf has stood up.). But by the end of the year, public opinion and a sore foot that sidelined Abdul-Rauf for the last eight games of the season, a season that ended in the Nuggets just barely missing the playoffs, drove him off the cliff. He is a quitter, began Paiges March 29, 1996 column. He quit because of a faint heart and a weak character... A mans physical suffering cant be judged by others. Some can perform hurt; some cant. However, professional athletesand actors, lawyers, construction workers, presidents, doctors and ditch diggersare expected to play with pain... Abdul-Raufs sore foot is as sincere as Babe Ruths belly ache.

In his season roundup, Paige advocated for trading Abdul-Rauf for ..a first-round draft pick or a point guard or even Betsy Ross. Abdul-Rauf was a disruption, a distraction and a dissenter, and he should take his mangled baggage out of Denver International Airport. That is what ended up happening, with Abdul-Rauf getting shipped out to Sacramento for not much, where he had his minutes slashed for two straight years in what should have been the prime of his playing career. After his contract expired, no one in the whole NBA could make themselves sign him, so he played in Turkey instead, spent a year out of basketball altogether, and then returned to the Vancouver Grizzlies, of all teams, and farted out one last year before heading for the exit.

Abdul-Rauf, for his part, has no regrets, even having lost millions of dollars due to the leagues de facto expulsion of him for adhering to what he felt his faith demanded (hes currently a co-captainand one of the oldest playersin the BIG3 league). The NBA, you have to imagine, doesnt really either. When commissioner Adam Silver was asked about Kaepernicks protests, he reiterated that standing for the anthem was NBA policy and that they would continue to enforce it.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is not a person reasonable people agree with. Even compared to Trump and the other maniacs in the executive branch, he believes some truly unnerving crap and presided over a country with an atrocious human rights record. But when you see how the capital class that owns sports teams are willing to ruthlessly enforce norms of expression in expelling dissenting players from their leagues, and when youre subject to legit roastings from tyrannical Iranian ex-presidents, its hard not to wonder if the United States is prone to quashing dissent just like the countries we regard as our enemies. It just takes a few more steps to get there."
2018-05-22,Daily Beast,Democrats Try to Thread the Needle on Russia in New Anti-Corruption Platform,"Some Democrats are annoyed with the cable news fixation on every twist and turn of the Russia investigation. Others think the party needs more focus on the issue. But Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD), the chair of the congressional Democracy Reform Task Force, thinks hes found a way to thread the needle.

I mean you can basically say Look, nobody should be interfering with our democracy, with our elections, Sarbanes said in an interview with The Daily Beast on Monday. So foreigners shouldnt be doing it, special interests shouldnt be doing it, big money shouldnt be doing it. It belongs to you, the people. Its your campaign, its your politics, its your government.

Sarbanes, along with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), unveiled a broad anti-corruption platform on Monday meant to serve as a supplement to the Democrats economic messaging in the Better Deal platform. Riffing on President Trumps own successful slogan drain the swamp, the platform is intended to fix the campaign finance system, strengthen ethics laws and facilitate better access to the ballot box for every American voter. It harkens back to a successful messaging platform of 2006, a year in which Democrats won majorities in both the House and Senate.

Putting this out now, six months ahead of 2018s midterm elections, accomplishes two things in Sarbanes eyes. It provides an additional incentive for voters to consider a changing of the guard in the nations capital and holds members accountable at the same time. Should Democrats win a majority in November, in part because of this messaging, it will be incumbent upon them to pass legislation in the first 100 days that accomplishes these goals.

This reform message is not something you just wear for the evening, this is something you own, Sarbanes said.

And its broad enough in scope, Democrats hope, that it provides an anecdote to the drumbeat of stories about corruption, from foreign and domestic sources.

Every new story is a story about how somebody else is manipulating the government that should belong to the people, Sarbanes told The Daily Beast. Voters, he said dont have to parse through the latest story on why theyre being disrespected or exploited or taken advantage of. Because they can seek refuge in something thats positive and affirmative that restores their place in their own democracy."
2018-03-04,Daily Beast,What Does the Bible Teach About Transgender People,"On February 18, the Kansas Republican Party passed an unusual anti-transgender resolution that is more theology than politics. Proposed by Eric Teetsel, head of the Kansas chapter of the Family Policy Alliance (the political arm of the Christian Right behemoth Focus on the Family) it is part of a national strategy to delegitimize transgender people and the concept of transgender itself, all on religious grounds.

Those, then, are the terms on which I, as a rabbi, will engage it. Because as a theological document, it is profoundly flawed.

Gods design was the creation of two distinct and complementary sexes, male and female, the resolution states. Nevertheless, many have sought to normalize transgenderism and define gender according to ones self-perception apart from biological anatomy. After listing some of the ways in which society has done so, the resolution says these cultural currents run counter to Gods created order and violate the dignity of every human being.

For that reason, it concludes, we affirm Gods design for gender as determined by biological sex and not by self-perception and we oppose all efforts to validate transgender identity. And so on.

Lets focus on two important errors in that text.

First, yes, in the Genesis story, God creates human beings of male and female sex.   But the creation story says nothing about gender. Notice how the end of the resolution talks about Gods design for gender as determined by biological sex. Where did that come from? What chapter and verse?

Remember, sex is not the same as gender. Definitionally, sex is about chromosomes; gender is about cultural practices. Sex is what is between our legs; gender is what is between our ears. My male sex means I can grow a beard; my male gender means its socially acceptable for me to do so  but not, in conservative societies, to wear high heels and makeup. Of course, theres nothing objectively male or female about shoes and clothes; they are aspects of gender, and they are socially constructed.

Now, just because the Genesis story is silent about gender doesnt mean the Bible is. In fact, the Bible presents clear gender roles, aligned with sex, in which women are subordinate to men. Wives, submit to your husbands as you do the Lord. (Eph. 5:22) Men purchase and own their (multiple) wives, may forcibly marry the widows of enemies they kill, and may hold concubines as additional sexual partners in addition to their wives.

Is this what Teetsel means by Gods design for gender?

Even if it is, what about those men and women who deviate from gender roles in the Bible? The patriarch Jacob, for example, is clearly gendered female in comparison with his twin brother Esau. Esau is hairy, Jacob is smooth; Esau is a hunter, Jacob stays in the tent (which is where women stay) and cooks; Esau is favored by his father, Jacob by his mom. And yet Jacob is the chosen one who becomes Israel, who fathers a nation.

Of course, Jacob didnt go on hormone therapy, but the way the Bible constructs his gender identity makes it very clear that, at least until his transformative nighttime wrestling match, he is gender non-conforming.

Likewise, Deborah the Judge, who performed a male societal role. Likewise, the beautiful young David in his armor-carrier relationships with Saul and Jonathan. (1 Sam. 16;12, 1 Sam. 18:1-3) Likewise the Apostle Paul, who rebelled against the most fundamental gender role of his time, fathering children, by becoming celibate. Likewise the pairs of female emissaries in the New Testament, Tryphaina and Tryphosa (Romans 16:12) and Euhodia and Syntyche (Phil. 4:1), who preached the gospel in ways usually reserved for men. On and on and on, the Bible presents heroic characters who vary from normative gender roles.

If the Bible is our guide, then Gods design for gender is a gigantic rainbow of variation, not a black-and-white conformity with sex.

Second, the resolution argues that to normalize transgender would violate the dignity of every human being. In fact, the opposite is true. Societally, we recognize and affirm the dignity of every human being when we respect their profound sense of self-understanding  echoed by science, culture, and history.

Really, there are only two options when it comes to transgender people. One is to listen to what they have to say. The other is to decide that they are so deeply mentally ill that they cannot be trusted to describe their own experiences.

The trouble is, the latter is simply incompatible with actually knowing anyone trans, or even watching someone trans speak in the media. It's a kind of willful blindness, coupled with an outrageous dehumanization. After all, its not just one or two people; its hundreds of thousands of people articulately describing their experiences.

Moreover, the overwhelming consensus of scientists agrees with what trans people themselves say. When trans people are able to live as themselves, they are measurably, objectively happier, healthier, and safer.

So, to hold some kind of trans-invalidating position is so counterfactual, counter-moral, and counter-scientific that it begs the question of whether it's a position at all, or is in fact a fear or prejudice. It certainly isnt respecting the human dignity of trans people.

Here is an alternative religious explanation.

If we are to believe in Gods design, we must look at what God has designed. In Biblical text and most of life, sex is indeed male and female. And for the vast majority of people, sex and gender align: I am biologically male, was assigned male at birth, identify as male, and mostly present as masculine.

For roughly 0.6% of people, however, gender and sex do not align. Just as I know myself to be a man, transgender people know (and medical professionals confirm) that their gender does not match their sex, or the gender they were assigned at birth.

In the past, trans people, though not known as such, had a wide variety of social roles. In the West, most likely suffered through their gender dysphoria, or identified as gay or lesbian, or worked as cross-dressers or performers or sex-workers, living on the margins of society. Others may have expressed their gender in other ways, by being tomboys or sissies; or male florists or female soldiers, for example. Some lived according to their gender, hiding their anatomical sex their entire lives. A few fortunate ones, such as Queen Christina of Sweden, were able to live lives that look recognizably transgender today.

In some other cultures, the situation was different. In India, for example, hijra are male-bodied people who dress as women, do not marry, and have defined (and often stigmatized) social roles, particularly at lifecycle events. There are extensive records of African and Native American cultural roles held by third gender persons, who often cross-dressed, held spiritual leadership roles, and were regarded as rare, special beings.

This is Gods plan, then: a spectrum of gender. So what do we do about it?

Clearly, we must support trans people to Choose life. (Deut. 30:19)

Today, as transgender people have demanded their rights and recognition, and as medical science has evolved, a wide variety of options are available. Some opt for hormone therapy or gender confirmation surgery of various types. Others do not pursue medical intervention but present  dress, speak, act  according to their gender identity. Still others find themselves somewhere in between the categories our society promotes, and identify as gender-queer or somewhere along a non-binary gender spectrum.

For those of us who are not trans, we are called to listen, rather than dictate. We are called to open ourselves to the truth, not to our opinions. Love, after all, rejoices with the truth. (1 Cor. 13:7)

Remember, being transgender isnt simply a feeling or a preference; its a profound, often difficult process of self-understanding. A trans woman understands herself to be female just as much as I understand myself to be male. Usually, such self-understanding takes place together with mental health professionals, counselors, and doctors. It is a moral journey.

Neither the pain of gender dysphoria nor the joy of living authentically as ones true self are trivial matters. They are profoundly moral, religious ones.

On the one hand, if God loves human beings, then God cannot abide the pain of gender dysphoria. It is not real love to allow such harm to take place, because love does no harm to its neighbor. (Romans 13:10) And I cannot stand by while a society stigmatizes transgender people, causes them suffering, or creates a world in which transgender women (particularly women of color) continue to be assaulted and even murdered at shocking rates. Your brothers blood cries out to me from the ground. (Gen 4:10)

Whereas, when I see my transgender friends living their lives as pastors, rabbis, artists, politicians, colleagues, performers, dads, moms, and ordinary human beings (and yes, I know trans folks who are all of these), I see the wondrous diversity of Gods many-gendered faces. This diversity, not some oppressive and artificial monoculture, is how God, nature, and humanity flourish. Truly, the fruit of the Spirit is joy. (Galatians 5:22)

Open your eyes, Eric Teetsel. (Num. 22:31) The truth will set you free. (John 8:32) God has far more expansive designs for gender than you seem able to yet acknowledge. So come learn the truth. Come meet some trans people. Talk to them. Or better yet, listen to them with your ears and heart open."
2018-04-25,Daily Beast,Im Not Done With Kanyebut Its Getting Hard to Justify This,"I love Kanye. And when you truly love an artist, you ride with them through thick and thin. But riding with Kanye aint always easy. Lord, hes been testing me with all this playing footsie with right-wing ideas.

He hurt me in 2016 when he posed with President Trump just days after the election. It felt bizarre, but bizarre is normal in Kanyes world. And he didnt actually say anything crazy at the time, so I dismissed it all as a sort of performance-art stunt. I gave the brother a pass. I mean, hes made so much great music.

Still, I wanted to know what he was really doing there with Trump. Kanye loves to be iconic and iconoclasticI can see where a picture alongside Trump could satisfy both of those impulses in him. But then, days after the Trump Tower visit, he said, in a mid-concert rant that he didnt votegroanbut if he had he wouldve voted for Trump.

That was hard to hear. Why exactly did he support Trump? He was never clear. Did he like the attack on immigrants? Did he like Trumps appeal to white victimhood, white entitlement, and white privilege? I didnt know. Ye wasnt really saying. Shortly after these rants, he was admitted to a UCLA Medical Center named for Ronald Reagan, natch, because he was suffering from exhaustion and sleep deprivation. An anonymous source told People magazine that Kanye was really going through it after using many different medications. I told myself, that solves it. He was going through a rough time. He didnt really mean it. Yes reader, I justified his behavior. Thats what you do when youre a real fan. You justify. And you forgive. So I did. I had to. I mean, cmon, hes made so much great music.

But in that same concert where he said he wouldve voted for Trump, he also said black Americans should stop focusing on racism, which is curious because the problem is not us focusing on racism. The problem is racism. Not talking about it wont make it go away any more than not thinking about the weather will make it sunny. Indeed, we talk about the weather partly to prepare ourselves for itif you wear a heavy coat in the winter, youll get through it. And if you understand the nature of racism, white privilege, inherent biases, and stereotype threat, then you have a chance of finding ways to deal with them. But hey, Kanyes entitled to his own view, right? And, its not like hes putting these ideas into the music, right?

Look, Im trying to ride with Kanye here because I love him. Im a real Kanye fan. Ive loved him since album one and Ive loved almost every record since then, even 808s and Heartbreak. And Im so here for the Kanye circus. The crazy rants, the presidential pronouncements, the big ideas, the insane ideas, the clothes, the ego, the award-show interruption theateryes, yes, yes! Kanyes like an old-school rock star living by his own rules and a postmodern performance artist trolling society.

I met Kanye when he was promoting his first album and I was writing about him for Rolling Stone. I met him at his apartment in a high-rise in New Jersey. He was in the bedroom for an hour after I arrived, getting dressed, trying to figure out which polo shirt to wear. I waited by walking around the place. I found on one wall a huge poster of... Kanye. He was mid-performance, yelling into a microphone.

When he finally came out, wearing a polo shirt, I said why do you have a poster of you on the wall in your own house? His answer was brilliantI have to cheer for me before anyone else can cheer for me. Be your own biggest fan! Its a great idea. You can totally hijack your sense of self-esteem and consciously convince yourself to believe in yourself to a radical degree. That sounded awesome and inspiring when he was a young rapper/producer still on the rise. I respected him a lot for that mind-set. And I felt like, deep down, I understood him. The productive young ego may have grown out of controlbut without that boundless self-esteem, Kanye would have never made it in the first place.

But being a Kanye fan means constantly defending him, which creates a sort of bunker mentality. Which makes you really dig in. Im a fan from day one so Im dug way in. So it was hard for me to get mad at Kanye. Until last weekend.

He tweeted I love the way Candace Owens thinks and it felt like a circuit breaker in my mind broke. What does that really mean? Owens says racial oppression doesnt exist, racism has nothing to do with police killing black men, and Black Lives Matter activists are pretending to be oppressed. She gives comfort to white people on the right, telling them racism is in the past and they have nothing to apologize for and no work to do to help current black Americans. What part of all that does Kanye love? And how much does she get paid for saying it?

Kanye also, on Twitter last weekend, repeated some of the hollow phrases black conservatives love to throw at progressives. There was a time, he tweeted, when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now its a mentality. Slavery was never a trend like orthopedic sneakers are now and the slave mentality schoolyard taunt is empty and tired. It posits that the overwhelming majority of black people are still slaves, insulting both black Democrats and black history. I dont think anyone was ever inspired to join a political movement by insults.

Also, the black rights critique of the black left doesnt take into account that the option the right is offering is horrible. Its hard to argue that black voters should join the right when the right treats black Americans like were the enemy. Does the modern GOP seem to stand up for black people? Does it demonize black and brown people with its rhetoric and its policies? Does it vigorously oppose immigration from African and Latin American countries? Does it consistently oppose government programs that help so many black families? Does it revel in conspiracy theories that challenge President Obamas citizenship and his legitimacy? Is it hostile to the voting rights of black people by insisting on voter-ID statutes that court after court have found to be an almost surgical attempt to disenfranchise black voters? Has it closed abortion centers and curtailed the ability for many black women to exercise the right to choose and the ability to control their bodies, lives, and families? Has it vigorously supported the National Rifle Association, which never seems to stand up for black gun owners like Philando Castile or John Crawfordor toy gun-holding children like Tamir Rice? Has it been tolerant of the overt racists in its tent? Does it address racism in policing and the justice system? Does it lionize media voices like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Rush Limbaugh, who regularly dismiss the existence of racism? Where, within that universe of thought, am I supposed to fit? Even if Kanye, Candace, and the right could convince me that the left was not the answer, when would they admit that the modern Republican Party is not welcoming for most black and brown people?

Kanyes making it harder to love Kanye. Its always been hard loving Kanye, but the righty rhetoric aligns him with people and ideas that are actively hostile toward black and brown people. Im going to continue to try to keep loving him because, you know, hes made so much great music, but theres only so many times that he can play with right-wing toys before I start to feel like nah, theres no beat hot enough and no verse dope enough to make me put on your record and also forget that you think its cool to co-sign people whose politics are dangerous for black people.

But Im not done with him yet. Our relationship may be growing complicated but for now, Im sticking with my man. Because I still dont know if his heart is all the way in on the right. Maybe hes just trolling us. Maybe he thinks being a black conservative seems like the most radical move he could make right now and he wants to shock, but he doesnt really believe any of that stuff. That would be a dangerous game. Either way, Kanye just empowered Owens, made her famous, helped her broadcast her message. Shell always be the one who Kanye co-signed. Expect to see her on Fox News way more.

Yes making it harder to keep justifying him but for now, I still do. Because I still dont believe that he really believes any of that conservative stuff. But then again, I dont believe Owens really believes that stuff either."
2018-10-08,Daily Beast,Kenyas Worst Rhino Massacre Was the Work of People Trying to Save the Species,"NAIROBIYou may have missed World Rhino Day last month. Even here in Kenya, many people did. Such events rarely raise the publics consciousness the way they should, and this year, certainly, there was not much to celebrate.

Kenya is home to many of the rhinos surviving in the wild, but it is still reeling from a veritable massacre in  July and August at one of the country's most famous national parks: 11 eastern black rhinos dead out of a population of 750. And those responsible for the shocking deaths are not poachers, but the very same organizations charged with saving the species: World Wildlife Fund-Kenya, Kenya Wildlife Service, and Kenyas Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife.

The tragedy began on July 13, when Kenyans woke to the news that at least seven black rhinos had died mysteriously, not killed by hunters. The death toll reached 11 in less than six weeks. All had lost their lives in the same sanctuary, where they had been relocated , precisely, in order to ensure the species survival.

Some conservationists called this the worst tragedy in the history of wildlife conservation.

Paula Kahumba, CEO of the non-profit organization Wildlife Direct, told reporters this was a complete disaster. Many people might think of the loss as incalculable, but for those less sensitive to the fate of wildlife, Kahumba put a figure on it: Each animal is worth about a million dollars. Its like $7 million just vanished into thin air.

In the 1950s Kenyas Tsavo East National Park was home to an estimated 2,000 eastern black rhino. By the 1970s, this population had dwindled, almost entirely as a result of poaching for the international rhino-horn trade, to an estimated 400.

As of early 2018, due to anti-poaching efforts and to conservationists work to grow viable rhino populations, the World Wildlife Fund counted the population at 750. The new Rhino Conservation Strategy (2017-2021) of the Kenya Wildlife Service hopes to achieve 5 percent growth and attain a population of 830 by 2021. The mandate of almost all rhino-centric conservation organizationsstate or non-stateis keep those numbers growing.

Given that the numbers are so low to begin with, it might seem hard to imagine that there are places in this country with too many rhinos.  But establishing new populations in less densely populated areas is central to programs meant to reduce the risk of extinction. On its website, World Wildlife FundKenya, often known as WWF-K or WWF-Kenya, says it wants to spur breeding of black rhinos through securing new and safe habitats and minimizing loss, because experts agree that the number of rhinos in sanctuaries must be kept below carrying capacity by removing surplus rhino.

When Kenyas parks get congested,  animals are sent to other areas in a process known as translocation. They are captured, transported, and released.

Nairobi National Park, in sight of the capitals skyline, has proved to be a prime rhino breeding sanctuary in Kenya. Rhino reproduce there at an optimum rate, producing one calf per female every two years. But the Nairobi park can no longer sustain the growing population, and neither can the Lake Nakuru National Park, which has a similarly successful breeding record.

Another aim of translocations is to move endangered wildlife away from poachers, but the core purpose is to get them far away enough from other rhino populations to establish, over time, new bloodlines and genetically diverse populations.

The balance has to be just right. If there are too many animals in a confined area they either dont mate or become inbred. If there are too few in a vast park they may not find each other to mate.

In 2011 WWF-Kenya teamed up with the Kenya Wildlife Service to establish a rhino sanctuary in Tsavo East. The service had a proven track record. It had successfully moved 149 rhino between 2005 and 2017. Only eight of these died, and over a long period of time.

Moving rhino to establish a founder population in the 5,307-square-mile Tsavo East seemed like a good idea. Its big sky country, with a lot of room for the beasts to move around. But rhinos, while they may look like four-legged battle tanks, are in some respects remarkably fragile, and water quality is, for them, a critical issue.

In 2011 an Environmental Impact Assessment was conducted in the Tsavo East sanctuary to determine the suitability of this habitat, especially its water and vegetation. The result showed high levels of salt in the water.

So, between 2013 and 2015, with funding from WWF-Kenya, the wildlife service hired a private supplier to drill for fresh water in the proposed sanctuary. WWF-Kenya then brought the $1 million proposal for a translocation to the Kenya Wildlife Service board, at the time chaired by renowned paleontologist and wildlife warrior Dr. Richard Leakey.

Leakey vetoed the project three times, on the grounds that Tsavo East had suffered a long drought and the habitat was unsuitableits water had tested too salty for rhino consumption. Leakey recommended that WWF-Kenya return with the proposal when conditions improved.

Despite the high salinity of the water WWF-Kenya went ahead and continued building the sanctuary, with a 38-square-mile rhino territory enclosed by a solar-powered electric fence. Within the sanctuary WWF-Kenya established a boma (a more localized holding enclosure), where vets and rangers would look after translocated rhino for two weeks before releasing them into free range.

Paul Gathitu, a spokesperson for the Kenya Wildlife Service, says a lot of planning was done to ensure the rhinos safety in their new habitat. There has to be sufficient food, it has to be correct in terms of weather, in terms of water that is available, so all those factors had to be put in place including even the issue of security of the rhinos themselves. All that put together, we felt that the conditions were about right.

But the 2011 assessment showing high salinity was never revised. Moreover, Dr. Benson Kibore, chairman of Kenyas Union of Veterinary Practitioners (UVP), said tests of the water in drilled boreholes were conducted multiple times, up to May of 2018, and these tests revealed a saline content five times higher than in 2011.

In April of 2018, the three-year tenure of the KWS board of directors, including Leakey, terminated. Soon afterward WWF-Kenyas preparations for the translocation were set in motion. TheBigMove, as it was billed, would be a feather in the caps of WWF-Kenya and the Kenya Wildlife Service.

On June 25, @WWF_Kenya tweeted: Our family has grown and we need to move some members to a new home. Stay with us as we kick off the journey tomorrow at 7 am #TheBigMove.

The morning after the tweets went out, a crowd of politicians, senior staff from WWF-K, Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), and media gathered to launch The Big Move of 14 rhino to the new sanctuary at Tsavo East.

The kickoffs location was symbolic: the site in Nairobi National Park were, in 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and Richard Leakey torched tons of confiscated elephant tusks and rhino horn. Another such dramatic bonfire blazed in 2016.

These events ignited worldwide focus on efforts in Kenya to stop the slaughter of elephants and rhinos, and to help their populations grow once again.

Today marks the coming together of a dream that has been in the making for over seven years, Najib Balala, Kenyas Minister of Tourism and Wildlife, declared as The Big Move began.

An unspoken message was that Richard Leakey was out of the way. Those now in control of Kenyas wildlife establishment could work free of the constraints Leakey had imposed.

At the event, WWF-Kenya presented the park with two Land Cruisers, three motorbikes, night vision cameras, tents, radio equipment, binoculars and boots. This donation of two vehicles and other vital equipment. Minister Balala added, will go a long way in ensuring that our rangers on the front line are adequately equipped to carry out their duties.

The first three rhino slated to travel were camera- and social media-ready, complete with namesCarol, Cheptei, and Bolt. After the fanfare, KWS sharpshooters darted animals with a light tranquilizer, and the animals were pushed into crates. They then left the park and sped along a bumpy road 200 miles to their faraway new home. Cheptei, Carol, and Bolts arrival at the boma was the subject of confident tweets put out by the translocations organizers at WWF-Kenya on June 27: Carol, Cheptei and Bolt arrived safely at Tsavo late last night they are among 14 black rhino forming founder population.

No news seemed like good news.

The hear-hear tweets indicate that there was, at least at this stage, communication between KWS and WWF-K. The remaining 11 rhino were scheduled to travel, in stages, over the succeeding two weeks.

By all accounts the capture and transport phases of the translocation were going well. Veterinarians are typically in charge of these, while rangers and wardens are tasked with caring for the animals on their arrival at the release site, including the adaptation period in the boma.

According to a report made later by the Union of Veterinary Practitioners, the senior warden for Tsavo East accompanied the first lot of rhino, bringing enough fresh vegetation and water to last six days. (The Daily Beasts repeated efforts to communicate with this senior warden have been unsuccessful.)

Rangers assert that they provided fresh leafy vegetationcalled lucerne and also sugarcane strawsand fresh water from a 500-1,000 gallon water container known as a bowser.

Dr. Kibore from the Union of Veterinary Practitioners reports that a week after release, the warden called KWS headquarters to report peculiar behavior by the rhinos, and dispatched rangers with the bowser to the Galana River,  several miles from the sanctuary over rough terrain, to bring more fresh water. En route, the bowser broke.

Rangers and wardens, observing increased water intake among the rhinos and hyper-urination, suspected snakebite.

Four days passed before those dispatched with the bowser returned with water. Kibore cites the failure of rangers to act promptly on the broken bowser as the crucial lapse in the operation. The lack of adequate food and fresh water in the boma would have killed the rhino eventually, Kibore notes, but full-blown salt water will kill you first.

On the sixth day after their arrival, the veterinarians union report notes that rangers decided to give water from a nearby borehole. But the nearby borehole was the one that was making the rhinos sick to begin with. On July 3, seven days after the first three rhinos arrived, Bolt died. When vets arrived and scanned the corpse for snakebites, they couldnt find any. On the eighth day in the boma, two more rhinos displayed symptoms like those seen in Bolt. These two also died, as vets tried to treat them. Supposing that snake bite was killing the translocated rhinos, the vets released all but two of the remaining animals from the boma. The veterinarian union report indicates the rhinos dehydration was attributable to trauma. With trauma and stress of undergoing the capture process the rhinos feared the newly placed water points, thinking it was a trap. Kibore explains that the borehole water points are lined with black plastic, about which the rhino are skittish. He said the key reason the animals died, noted on the postmortem, was dehydration.

By the time the vets understood that, sure enough, salt water was the problem, it was too late. According to Kibore, the warden wasnt aware that rhinos could die from a high intake of salt water.

While a vet was present, he was coming and going between the sanctuary and the other parks, where the rhino embarked. Kibore told The Daily Beast that vets are usually not in attendance during the initial days following release because the wildlife services budget doesnt provide for that kind of post-translocation care.

By July 13 a total of at least seven rhinos had died, and news of the calamity broke to the outside world. Yet there seems to have been little communication in the intervening days among rangers, wardens, and vets in the sanctuary or at KWS headquarters.

Minister Balala, who was outside Kenya at the time, claims to have learned of the deaths only when the public did, and only via media coverage.

Leakey asserts that whatever communications there were between the boma and Kenya Wildlife Service headquarters have been suppressed. He adds that he has reason to think the rangers at Tsavo East had not even been informed that the rhino would be arriving.

Balala quickly issued a statement announcing suspension of the translocation of the three remaining rhino from Lake Nakuru. On his return to Kenya, he held a press conference and announced that he had called for an independent investigation. He later cited an independent post-mortem report stating that salt poisoning may have caused the rhinos to perish as they struggled to adapt to saltier water in their new home. Within six weeks of the translocations launch, all the rhinos moved to Tsavo East were dead. One of these was attacked, post-translocation, by lions. Though this death has been attributed to the attack, that rhino, given its dehydration and impaired health, was likely in no shape to fight. The irony that more rhino died in the translocation than were killed by poachers in 2017 was not lost on informed observers, particularly wildlife conservationists.

The public, in Kenya and outside, demanded answers. With many Kenyans agitating for Balala to resign, the bloodletting shifted, figuratively at least, to the human side of the equation.

Conservationists have blamed the rhino deaths on greed, negligence and the nebulous, growing role of NGOs in the wildlife conservation sector. Angry Kenyans wanted proof that the dead rhinos horns had not found their way into the illegal trade. They demanded photos of the corpses with the horns in place. At its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya Wildlife service displayed what it claimed were all 22 hornstwo cut off each rhino corpse. The Kenyan government has compiled but not yet released results of an initial inquiry, which sources say states that there were areas of clear negligence by KWS. Both Mohamed Awer, CEO of WWF-Kenya, and   Minister Balala acknowledged negligence in the translocation. The operations outcome came as no surprise to Leakey, who cites saltwater and mismanagement as prime ingredients in a recipe for disaster.  He places responsibility squarely with WWF-Kenya and on Balala, whom he referred to as CS, or Cabinet Secretary Balala.

The Kenya Wildlife Service would have only acted on orders of either the [KWS] board or the CS, Leakey told The Daily Beast. They would not have gone to WWF, so the must have given them the go ahead.

Balala, Awer, and their organizations insist that Leakey, when chair of KWS, had given provisional approval for the translocation. Leakey denies having given any approval, provisional or otherwise. Over the life of this project, one of the major donors, WWF, had variously expressed its views about the non-completion of the sanctuary, Leakey said in a press statement. Speaking with The Daily Beast, he added, The emergency, I think, was that WWF spent a lot of money building this sanctuary. They wanted the rhinos released in it so they could tell donors job done, ribbon tied, more money please.

WWF have no legal culpability here, Leakey observes. But this does raise questions about foreign assistance to countries. As in: who is the tail and who is the dog?

WWF needs to be accountable and put the animals welfare before finances, says Dr Kibore.

Leakey said that Balala had implied that a new KWS board of directors had met, which was a surprise since as far as he was aware a board hadnt been established. The absence of a board for the three months has left weighty decisions of the kind concerning discipline and direction entirely with the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife... It is unfortunate that the Ministers statement failed to reflect the fundamentals behind this tragedy and perhaps dig deeper into the real problems at KWS.

This absence of a KWS board, said Leakey, provided the window of opportunity for WWF-Kenya to push the translocation through with Minister Balala. Leakey explained to The Daily Beast that KWS is a parastatal organization structured like the military. You cannot run that sort of military organization without chain of command, if you break the chain of command at the top.

Offended by the recriminations aimed at him, Balala went on the offensive, accusing Leakey of trying to destroy KWS. The minister cited a recent Price Waterhouse Coopers audit of KWS funded by USAID, blasting KWS for poor management under Leakeys chairmanship.

While the battle between Leakey and Balala has raged in public, WWF-Kenya and KWS have for the most part kept mute. WWF-Kenya has not responded to The Daily Beasts requests for comment. KWS has vowed to take disciplinary action against its rangers if it is found that negligence played a part in the deaths. However, it remains to be seen whether the findings of the investigations will be made public, as promised by the government.

Claus Mortensen, who manages Mugie Ranch in Laikipia, moved 23 rhino from Laikipia to Ruma National Park in 2012. He worked closely with several of the wildlife service officers involved in the Tsavo East translocation. Theyre very competent in the job of the transferring, he said. Since the 2012 move, only two of those rhino have been lost to poaching. Rhinos are incredibly tough, Mortensen says. They lived all these millions of years. But theyre also super-fragile, especially when they get man-handled. His conclusion about the fatal Tsavo move: Its not the transferring that killed them, it was an oversight of looking carefully at the water supply."
2018-05-23,Daily Beast,SC County Council Candidate Blackface Photo Was Nod to Cool Runnings,"A photo of a county council candidate in South Carolina posing in blackface at a college party appeared online this week, outraging some community members. But Brant Tomlinson, the Republican running for the Kershaw County Council District 5 seat, said he had no idea the photo would court controversyand claims his getup was merely an homage to Cool Runnings.

Tomlinson insisted the photo, which shows him wearing black face paint and a black shirt bearing the colors of the Jamaican flag, was spread by an antagonist who was paid off by a rival candidate in an attempt  to misrepresent his character. The 10-year-old photo first circulated on Facebook and was taken during a college Halloween party, WACH FOX reported Tuesday.

It is unfortunate that local candidates have now resorted to the same type of toxic smear campaigns that have infected the political discourse at state and national level, Tomlinson said in a statement to WACH FOX.

The University of South Carolina graduate also told The State that he intentionally chose not to delete the photo when scanning his social-media profiles prior to running for public office.

I think thats one thing wrong with politicians: They try to hide everything they do, Tomlinson told the newspaper. I never in a million years really thought that would get a negative connotation on it.

The Camden native, who did not apologize for the photo, said in his statement that Cool Runnings, the cult classic about a Jamaican bobsled team, is one of his all-time favorite movies.

Tomlinson did not respond to requests for comment from The Daily Beast, but he told WACH FOX that he wishes he would have known how his decision in the past would affect others.

It shows that you have a sense of privilege that doesnt extend your consciousness level in thinking about who youre offending, Phyllis Lloyd-Harris, the head of the Kershaw County Democratic Party, told The Daily Beast. It is not haha funny to me, as an African-American, to dress in blackface or any other stereotype of what you think black people are.

The Kershaw County Council election is less than a month away, on June 12. There is no mention of the blackface photo on Tomlinsons campaign Facebook account, but a local pastor endorses him in a video posted on Tuesday.  I know Brants convictions, his values, and most of all I know his heart, Jed Bryant said in the video."

2018-06-17,Daily Beast,The DNCs Lawsuit Against the Russians Became a Conspiracy Magnet,"The election interference lawsuit Democrats filed last April against Russia and the Donald Trump campaign is becoming a magnet for other aggrieved parties working to expose their own conspiracy theories.

In the last two months the court docket in Democratic National Committee v. The Russian Federation et al has been virtually overrun with dozens of filings by two conspiracy theorists, one who believes Trump-Russia is in the center of a conspiracy that resulted in the bank repossession of his home, and the other a New Orleans man warning that the U.S. government let loose a chemical weapon during Hurricane Katrina.

Available on the web for 10 cents a page, federal court dockets in newsworthy cases, like those linked to Russiagate, are followed slavishly by hundreds if not thousands of journalists and devotees of law.

It is not that easy to get on social media when youre talking about the things Im talking about, said one of the filers, David Andrew Christenson, in an interview with The Daily Beast. My only outlet, I realized a long time ago, would be the courts.

A 60-year-old Navy veteran from New Orleans, Christenson saw his house condemned after Hurricane Katrina hit the area in 2005. He believes, based largely on self-guided research, that a deadly chemical weapons agent that hes dubbed the Katrina Virus was released from top-secret CIA and Defense Department facilities during the hurricane, and has been quietly chalking up a global body count ever since.

Christenson has been featured in conspiracy blogs, and is the author of seven titles available on Amazon, including The New York Times and the Supreme Court Are Murdering Mankind via Direct and Indirect Suicide(s). The End Result Will be the Genocide and the Extinction of Mankind via the Katrina Virus, and An American Born Terrorists Emails To The Department of Justice, which consists of 422 pages from Christensons outbox.

Christenson said he turned to court filings as a last resort after his YouTube channel, Twitter account, and website were all shut down, and his direct outreach to government officials got him arrested on suspicion of cyberstalking an FBI agent (he was released with no charges after about two weeks in jail). He estimates that hes filed motions and letters in about 100 different cases over the years, though most judges have taken a dim view of his efforts. In February, a committee of federal judges in Chicago took the unusual step of blocking Christensons email addresses entirely from the courts system, complaining that his emails were straining judicial resources.

When Robert Mueller started handing down indictments last year, Christenson hit those cases like a graffiti artist on a freshly painted wall. Everything Mueller has brought Ive filed in, he said. But the Washington, D.C., court handling most of them is taking a hard line on docket spam, and virtually none of Christensons motions have made it into the case record. The Court recognizes that the movant sincerely believes that he has information to share that bears on this case, and that, understandably, he wishes to be heard, wrote Judge Amy Berman Jackson in a minute note last November in the Paul Manafort case. There are many places and means available for a private citizen to express his views about matters of public interest, but the fact is, the Courts docket is not one of them.

Last March, Christensons Emergency Motion to Intervene Filed on Behalf of All Americans slipped onto the Manafort docket, and Jackson dignified the filinga screed against Muellerwith a formal ruling denying the motion. At the same time, Jackson ordered that no further Christenson filings would be permitted into the case.

But the judge overseeing the Democratic National Committees civil lawsuit in New York, John Koeltl, has been more tolerant, and Christenson has filed 30 letters and motions by U.S. mail in six weeks. The continuing cover-up of what happened in New Orleans will ensure the Genocide of Mankind, he wrote in one. In another: If we dont change the narrative Mankind will cease to exist by October 12th, 2050. This is not a prophecy or prediction but a mathematical certainty.

Theres two court cases now where theyve sort of given me carte blanche, said Christenson. Theres this one, and there the BP Oil Spill appeal of mine to the 5th Circuit... It took me a long time to get to this point. Im putting everything in writing and putting it in the docket.

Christenson isnt the only one using the Russiagate lawsuit as a soapbox. Hes competing for eyeballs with Patrick Farrell, a Florida man whose two filings place both Trump and Russia in a complicated conspiracy that he says resulted in a bank foreclosure on his home, and that involves the Jews. He credits his own whistle-blowing with spawning the entire Robert Mueller investigation, and writes that hes faced retaliation ever since.

One of Farrells filings concludes on this note: WHEREFORE, I the Living Man, demand this court to monetary award for a 10 year frivolous filing, leave to amend and jury trial.

Christenson has encountered Farrell before on other cases, and doesnt think much of his work. I run into him all the time, he said. He confesses he even harbors suspicions that Farrell is part of a government plot to discredit Christensons filings. He may not exist."
2018-08-08,Daily Beast,Joanna Coles and the End of the Celebrity Glossy Magazine Editor,"Was former Hearst Magazines executive Joanna Coles the last of a dying breednamely the glossy-mag celebrity editor?

This past weekends announcement of her abrupt departure from the publishing enterprise where she has spent a dozen yearsfirst as top editor of Marie Claire and Cosmopolitan, and finally as Hearsts chief content officerwas in some ways a cliche of corporate intrigue in a business rife with delicious gossip.

It came at the same time as reports of Vogue doyenne and Conde Nast artistic director Anna Wintours persistently-rumored retirement (never mind Conde Nast CEO Bob Sauerbergs breathless statement last week that she has agreed to work with me indefinitely).

Coles' departure, alongside the whispers around Wintour, are two more harbingers of the gradual demise of print-on-paper publications athwart the digital revolutiona pitiless new economic paradigm that can no longer support the slick extravagance of the pre-Internet past.

By most accounts, the 56-year-old Coles and 50-year-old Troy Youngthe incoming president of Hearst Magazines, who was tapped three weeks ago to succeed longtime president and retiring chairman David Careycordially despised each other.

When Young and not Coles got the big job of running the publishing arm of the multimedia Hearst empire, her days were numbered and she had little choice but to resign with dignity, according to industry insiders. (On Wednesday, Coles' successor was named as Kate Lewis.)

Power struggles among deputies are as old as the hills. Nothing new here, a well-connected Hearst source texted The Daily Beast. Joanna had lots of options in the world. And Troy willand shouldrun the company in different ways. So everyone comes out ahead.

However, a mag biz insider lamented Coless departure, saying: Once again, mediocre white guys have been left in charge, and the brightest spot was Joanna.

Legendary former Vanity Fair and New Yorker editor-in-chief Tina Brown, founding editor of The Daily Beast, cast Coless departure as evidence of an alarming trend: Despite the noise of MeToo, brilliant women at the top are dropping like flies in terms of leadership.

Coles declined an interview request, choosing instead to rely upon an Instagram video in which she trudges on her office treadmill-desk (an appliance she delighted in showing off to visiting profile writers), while explaining that she plans to spend the rest of the summer playing tennis and attempting to communicate with her less than receptive teenage children before revealing whats next career-wise.

Have you any idea of the miles I have walked on this treadmill-desk through the peaks and the valleys of Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan and as Hearsts first chief content officer? she asks in the video. But my route is being recalculated. Its time for a new adventure.

A person familiar with Coless thinking, meanwhile, said she wants to indulge her entrepreneurial spirit and has been musing for awhile about leaving the comfortable confines of Hearst for a new challengea feeling that gained urgency when David Carey announced his retirement plans in late June. (Carey,  57, has accepted a fellowship at the Harvard Advanced Leadership Initiative starting in 2019.)

The end of the lavishly-compensated celebrity editor is a lagging indicator of the twilight of magazines, said cultural critic and novelist Kurt Andersen, who in the mid-1980s, co-founded Spy magazine with then-future Vanity Fair impresario Graydon Carter. This was an era when glossy monthlies like Conde Nasts Glamour and Hearsts Cosmo were minting money,

A year ago, when the larger-than-life, opulently-tressed Carter announced his VF leave-taking after a quarter-century as editor-in-chiefpartly because he didnt wish to participate in the bloody axe-wielding and draconian belt-tightening that brutal reality requiredAndersen predicted: I would say there wont be a magazine like Vanity Fair under Graydon Carterthose will cease to exist as a grand and physical thing full of all this aspiration, celebration and glamour and news... Its not going to be gone tomorrow or next year. Its going to be around for awhile. But this is a last hurrah of the magazine, and it will be a slow death for magazines...

As her exit video suggests, Coles has been exquisitely attuned to the diligent cultivation of her personal brand beyond her comparatively prosaic duties at Hearstmuch like Carter and his Conde Nast rival, artistic director and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.

Whereas Carter annually hosted VFs aggressively glitzy Oscar party, has co-owned three exclusive, celeb-friendly Manhattan restaurants, and had a cameo role as himself in 2010s Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Wintour has been the subject of several documentary films, notably 2009s The September Issue, presides over the Met Gala benefiting the museums Anna Wintour Costume Center and inspired Meryl Streeps portrayal of the caustic Runway editrix in 2006s The Devil Wears Prada.

Similarly, the British-born Coles, a freshly minted OBE, has regularly displayed her biting wit on television, especially on So Cosmo, the E! reality show she executive-produced (and which lasted only one season).

Coles boasts the same credit on the The Bold Type, a scripted Disney/ABC Freeform Channel series, recently renewed for a third season, romanticizing the mag biz, in which a Coles-inspired heroine is played by star Melora Hardin.

By contrast, few people outside the industry have heard of Michele Promaulayko, Coless successor at Cosmo. Meanwhile, Radhika Jones, Carters VF replacement, an academically-minded Time magazine and New York Times alum, has been so attention-averse that she has granted zero press interviews and even stopped tweeting altogether since she took over the magazine last December.

I think the whole notion of the outsized editor is gone, said a prominent member of that endangered species, who asked not to be named. It seems indulgent, and in this publishing environment, you cannot ultimately make that pay off. Advertising is a shit show, and the other thing, with Joanna, there was that constant tension between digital and print, and with whatever she was getting paid, there was no way she could survive that.

Indeed, a report this week by Womens Wear Dailybased on an analysis of data by the Association of Magazine Mediadocumented fading ad revenues and audience share under  the headline Ad Spending Disappearing as Most Magazines Continue to Fumble.

Reported magazine ad spending by the 50 biggest advertisers last year fell to $6.1 billion from $6.5 billion in 2016, according to AMMs annual report, said WWD. So magazines lost at least $417.5 million in revenue last year, a difference of 6.4 percent...

The story added: Overall, there are very few major magazine brands managing to pull strong through the digital shift. Of the 114 magazine brands tracked by AMM, 56 titles, or 50 percent, have a total audience in decline year-to-date. Print and digital editions are faring even worse, with 74 titles, or 64 percent of magazines, seeing audience on the decline. Little wonder advertisers are looking elsewhere.

The eventual death of magazines might be worthy of collective grief, but Kurt Andersen, for one, isnt mourning the twilight of the celebrity editor.

To what degree did any magazine ever require a quote-unquote superstar editor to be successful? he demanded. You can argue that the degree to which that is plausible varies from title to title. So can Radhika Jones be a good editor of Vanity Fair, and make it a great magazine without being a superstar?

Of course she can, he insisted.

In the same way there were more superstar novelists in the 1970s than there are today, cultural forms have their time in the sun and they come and go....The magazine age that existed for most of our lives began nearly a century ago when the superstar editors were H.L. Mencken [of The American Mercury] and Harold Ross [of The New Yorker]. That began the modern magazine era, and less than a century later, its winding down.

But theres nothing intrinsic that says that the editor of a digital publication cant be a quote-unquote superstar, Anderson continued. Maybe were still too early in the post-print age to see the first one."
2018-08-26,Daily Beast,Gamer David Katz IDd as Gunman Who Killed 2 Hurt 11 at Jacksonville Madden NFL Tournament,"A disgruntled gamer shot up a Madden NFL tournament on Sunday, killing two people and injuring 11 before taking his own lifethe chilling pop, pop of gunshots and ensuing chaos captured live on a video stream.

Police in Jacksonville, Florida, identified the shooter as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore, a competitive gamer who was attending the regional qualifier when he is said to have opened fire with a handgun.

Katz reportedly used the screen name Bread. A video posted by local TV station from an earlier tournament featured announcers discussing his emotionless playing style.

You are not going to see much emotion from our guy Bread, one of the announcers said. He keeps to himself. Hes a man of business.

Hes not here to make friends, the announcer added.

Police did not specify a motive. The Los Angeles Times reported Katz had lost the tournament before he began his rampage. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said investigators determined Katz was the only shooter.

The incident unfolded around 1:30 p.m. inside a restaurant filled with gamers hoping to do well enough in a regional qualifier to play in the national championship in Las Vegas later this year.

A livestream captured the moment a grim reality overtook the event. Most of the screen was taken up by the virtual players, with two top competitors shown in an inset. What appears to be a red dot flickers over the shirt of one of the young men, then the first shot rings out.

A dozen would be fired over roughly 20 seconds, and frantic audio of the aftermath was live for nearly two minutes.

Oh my God! one person could be heard saying.

Drini Gjoka, a top player, was shot in the thumb. His Twitter posts showed how abruptly the tournament went from the scene of fun gaming to one of bloodshed.

Won my first single elim game 16-9. Off to Round of 32, he wrote.

Minutes later, he tweeted: The tourney just got shot up. Im leavinng [sic] and never coming back.

I will never take anything for granted ever again. Life can be cut short in a second, he wrote later.

The mother of Michael Skimbo, another gamer at the tournament, said she was playing the livestream while making lunch and was sent into a panic by the gunshots.

We were waiting for him to play. I heard the shots on my laptop and I went in there to see what was going on, Valerie Skimbo said in an interview with The Daily Beast.

I could hear in the background... Oh my god! Oh my god! then the screen went blank, and I started praying, Let Michael be OK.

I got on my phone and I texted him. He usually doesnt reply to me, she added. I said, Let me know right now if youre OK. He called. He said, Mom, Im OK, I love you, I gotta go, and then he hung up.

The tournament took place inside Chicago Pizza, a restaurant with a video game bar at Jacksonville Landing, a popular tourist spot downtown that was packed with people.

In a series of tweets, police confirmed the shooting, then urged the public to stay away.

We cant stress enough to stay away. Many blocks away, one police post said.

SWAT teams working to clear the area were finding many people hiding in locked areas at The Landing, police said.

We ask you to stay calm, stay where you are hiding, they tweeted. SWAT is doing a methodical search inside The Landing. We will get to you. Please dont come running out.

The two gamers who were killed Sunday were named as Eli Clayton, who played under the name Trueboy, and Taylor Robertson, who used the name SpotMePlzzz.

Four of the 11 victims being treated in hospital were named as George Amadeo II, 17, David Echevarria, 28, Alexander Madunic, 27, and Christopher McFarland, 31. All are said to be in a good condition and recovering from minor injuries.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott visited victims at the hospital. Sujeil Lopez tweeted a photo of her son with the governor and said he was shot three timesand another picture of his bloodied gear.

Madden NFL is one of the most popular video games of all time. The tournament in Jacksonville was the Southeast qualifier, offering $5,000 in prize money. First- and second-place finishers were to qualify for the Madden 19 Live Finals in Las Vegas in October, which offers $165,000 in prize money and pays for travel and lodging.

EA Sports, the franchise's parent company, called the shooting a horrible situation and a senseless act of violence that we strongly condemn.

2018-08-06,Daily Beast,Sacha Baron Cohen Gets Joe Arpaio to Accept Amazing Blow Job From Trump,"After an underwhelming Who Is America? episode last week, Sacha Baron Cohen came roaring back Sunday night with a brand new character and Americas toughest sheriff, Joe Arpaio.

Arpaio, who was recently pardoned by President Donald Trump for illegally detaining Latinos in Arizona, is vying for the Republican nomination for Senate in that state. His appearance with Baron Cohen isnt likely to help him get any closer to his goal.

Playing a Finnish unboxing celebrity named OMGWhizzBoyOMG with a shock of bright orange hair, Baron Cohen sat down with the former sheriff and first asked him to explain what communists are doing to stop people having guns.

Within seconds, Baron Cohen was using a tiny Shopkins donut toy to have a debate about gun control with Arpaio. Bad guys are going to get their guns! Arpaio said directly to the toy.

I have 43 guns, Baron Cohen told his guest. Ive been collecting them for the upcoming race war. Arpaio didnt blink.

Later, Baron Cohen asked Arpaio what Donald Trump is like. Great man, Arpaio said. He has a lot of money, but he doesnt act that hes rich. Asked if Trump has had a golden shower, a confused Arpaio replied, Wouldnt surprise me. He predicted that Trump would like the host because you think like he thinks.

From there, Baron Cohen started asking Arpaio about his first hand job, adding, If Donald Trump calls you up after this and says, Sheriff Joe, I want to offer you an amazing blow job, would you say yes?

I may have to say yes, he replied calmly.

Last month, Arpaio was among the many prominent public figures who admitted they had been tricked by Baron Cohen, claiming that he became uncomfortable in the interview when the comedian started using words like hand job and golden shower. But it was hard to tell that from the segment that aired.

I felt uncomfortable with some of the words they were using but I had to live through it, Arpaio said of the experience . I am not the type of guy who gets up and walks out. I never walked out in thousands of interviews. I just take it. I was kind of shocked. But I figured this is Finland and this is a famous comedian. He added that he signed some kind of contract before filming but did not read all the info."
2018-11-16,Daily Beast,Julian Assange Has Been Charged According to Justice Department Filing,"An obscure sex-crime case may have just revealed a groundbreaking moment for the intersecting worlds of press freedom, espionage, and the Trump-Russia case: sealed federal criminal charges against WikiLeaks Julian Assange.

An August filing by the Justice Department in a case involving a Washington, D.C.-area man, Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, accidentally names the founder of the anti-secrecy group in two paragraphs, reporting that a federal criminal complaint has been lodged against him in secrecya development long feared by Assange and his allies.

The Justice Department conceded to The Daily Beast and other outlets that Assanges name was in the document as a result of an error but answered no further questions about the apparent charges against Assange.

The slip-up was first spotted by Seamus Hughes, a terrorism analyst at George Washington University who was closely following the case and flagged the passage on Twitter:

On Aug. 22, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kellen S. Dwyer filed a motion to temporarily seal Kokayis charges pending his arrest, which occurred the next day, Aug. 23.

At first, Dwyers filing understandably argues that disclosure would jeopardize Kokayis arrest. It proceeds to argue that redacting parts of the document would be insufficient to mitigate the potential harm. But then the attorney makes an accidental declaration.

Another procedure short of sealing will not adequately protect the needs of law enforcement at this time because, due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged, Dwyer wrote.

Kokayi is not elsewhere described as a particularly sophisticated defendant, and his case received no publicity. But the description fits Assanges circumstances perfectly.

A second reference to Assange includes even more details that apply to the fugitive leak master, and not to Kokayi. The complaint, supporting affidavit, and arrest warrant, as well as this motion and the proposed order, would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.

Kokayi was arrested in Virginia and did not need be extradited. Assange, in contrast, would have to be extradited from the U.K. to face U.S. charges.

It seems possible or even likely that someone cut and pasted from a prior motion to seal involving a defendant named Assange, said Barbara McQuade, the former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. I know of only one Assange facing potential charges.

It could be a [prosecutor] or support staff member who prepared the document, since a sealing order is sort of a boilerplate filing, said McQuade.

Dwyer works out of the U.S. Attorneys Office in Alexandria, Virginia, and is not part of special counsel Robert Muellers team.

A Justice Department spokesperson, Joshua Stueve, told The Daily Beast, The court filing was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing. Asked repeatedly if Assange had been indicted and if the slip-up had jeopardized any prosecution of a man who has lived for years in Ecuadors London embassy, Stueve said he had no further comment.

The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources, reported late Thursday that what Dwyer was disclosing was true, but unintentional.

Barry Pollack, an attorney for Assange, told the Post he did not know if his client had been charged. The only thing more irresponsible than charging a person for publishing truthful information would be to put in a public filing information that clearly was not intended for the public and without any notice to Mr. Assange, he said.

The notion that the federal criminal charges could be brought based on the publication of truthful information is an incredibly dangerous precedent to set.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Thursday that the Justice Department was preparing to indict Assange.

In an interview with the Journal, John Demers, who runs the Justice Departments national-security division, said about possibly prosecuting Assange: On that, Ill just say, Well see.

An indictment of Assange, whom Mueller has portrayed in his own indictments as a cats paw of Russian intelligence, would immediately draw worldwide attention.

Since Assange disclosed hundreds of thousands of tactical military reports from Iraq and Afghanistan and cables from U.S. diplomats worldwide in 2010, press-freedom advocates have warned that a U.S. government move against him for fundamentally journalistic activitypublishing documents in the public interestwould be illegitimate and set a fearsome precedent.

Yet Assanges irascible personal behavior and accusations of sexual assault by two women in Sweden wore away his store of goodwill from many advocates even before WikiLeaks published embarrassing information from leading Democrats purloined by Russian intelligence and surreptitiously cultivated ties to the Trump campaign that had nothing to do with its ostensible anti-secrecy mandate.

Still, for eight years, no government effort at investigating Assange has yielded any charges. Numerous reports over the years have claimed that Justice Department attorneys have found no evidence or legal theory sufficient to indict WikiLeaks but narrow enough to avoid the specter of criminalizing legitimate journalism or other First Amendment-protected activity.

Should that have recently changed and Assange been indicted, Dwyers ominous reference gave no indication as to the pivotal question of what Assange is accused of doing. No one at the Justice Department or FBI responded to The Daily Beasts repeated inquiries on the subject.

Any prosecution of Mr. Assange for WikiLeaks publishing operations would be unprecedented and unconstitutional, and would open the door to criminal investigations of other news organizations, said Ben Wizner, a senior attorney with the ACLU, who also represents the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Moreover, prosecuting a foreign publisher for violating U.S. secrecy laws would set an especially dangerous precedent for U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the publics interest."
2018-03-29,Daily Beast,Trevor Noah Mocks Trump His Doctor Deserved Promotion for Seeing Him Naked,"Trevor Noah opened Wednesday nights Daily Show with breaking news out of Trumps White House: Believe it or not, today someone got fired, the host said.

The comedian was referring to David Shulkin, who lost his job as secretary of Veteran Affairs in favor of the presidents personal doctor, Ronny L. Jackson.

Yep, President Trump has fired his secretary of Veterans Affairs, Noah said. And hes replaced him with the official White House doctor, the man who gave Trump his presidential physical.

Jackson is the same doctor who famously flattered Trump by praising his incredible genes and saying during a press conference that he told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old.

The host said this sort of makes sense because Trump probably figured, Anyone whos seen me naked deserves a reward. As Stormy Daniels photo appeared on screen, he added, So it was either this promotion or paying him $130,000. And Im never doing that again."
2018-09-13,Daily Beast,Inside Marc Jacobs Very Late but Very Fabulous NYFW Show,"Marc Jacobs starts on time, very on time. In February, Cardi B held things up for mere seconds and it felt scandalous, as she made her way, glacially slowly as watches were tapped, to her front-row seat.

On Wednesday night, at the Park Avenue Armory, the show started 1 hour and 26 minutes late. Most people stayed, some people left, including one person who said she had a plane to catch to London. Fashion, darling.

Before arrival, guests had been warned of a half-hour delay, and so turned up at 6.30pm. And then time stretched ever further.

The celebrities thereNicki Minaj and Emily Ratajkowski among themstayed true to Jacobs, though one felt sorry for the person next to Minaj, whose fabulous dress needed multiple seats to itself and whose contretemps with Cardi B constituted one of Fashion Weeks most extreme storylines.

At 1 hour and 24 minutes, Anna Wintour, the most powerful person in fashion and who is obviously much busier than anyone else and certainly more important, was seen being guided back to her seat by security.

I can see my seat, its just through there, she said. If she was making a break for the border, it had been scotched by the chic men in black suits.

As yet it is a mystery why this epic lateness occurred.

Most likely, it was something with the outfits, which turned out to be madly elaborate and beautiful. A stitch coming loose in any of these amazing constructions would have made for a last-minute sewing nightmare. Maybe multiple ones came apart at the delicate seams. Show officials paced the runway silently, but not frantically, for nearly an hour and a half. (The Daily Beast reached out to a Marc Jacobs representative for comment and will update this article if it is forthcoming.)

It may, as some online fashion wags have posited, been a power play. Traditionally, Jacobs has the last show slot at Fashion Week. The prompt start time is a brief corrective to the shows that start 20 minutes after their advertised start times.

But on Wednesday night Jacobs was not closing out New York Fashion Week. He has big-name competition in Rihanna, whose Fenty show in Brooklyn was due to start at 7.30 p.m. Was he trying to steal her thunder? Some guests left to attend her show. It wasnt a mass exodus, but it was noticeable.

Are Jacobs and Rihanna the Bethenny and Carole of The Real Fashion Designers of New York?

Theirs are actually not the latest shows on Wednesday night; the label truly closing out NYFW is Barragan (a Daily Beast favorite), which started at 8 p.m.

The irony of the drama? The outfits were a dream, a crazed fever dream, but beautiful and inventive. If you waited it out, you were rewarded: It was Valley of the Dolls meets Londons Blitz club of the 1980s where dressing up was deadly serious play.

If you liked Bubble's demented costuming in Absolutely Fabulous, then this was the show for you: materials, shapes, drapes, and contours in clashing, mad-science symphony: fashion as performance art.

There were ruffles, and ruffles within ruffles in frocks that were less frocks than constructions. At the start, you saw the most giant versions on lapels of those Carrie Bradshaw oversized silk flowers that started turning up on every outfit in Season 3 of Sex and the City. The explosion of pastels was as if Barbara Cartlands wardrobe had been raided, and elaborated upon, with glittering sheen and pinking shears.

Soon we were into shiny pink dresses with whole necks and arms buried under ruffles, like a firework had been placed in a nest of meringues.

A vibrant yellow mackintosh with latex headscarf reminded me of Princess Margaret taking a colorful walk in some 60s rain.

Even fitted evening dresses, like a pink and orange-studded number, came with feathers flying from a cascading structural waterfall on the top half and around the hips. A coat dress in blue was a puffball of fabric and feathers; the pants stayed high-waisted while the oversize rosettes (sometimes attached to the waist) and whirls become more enveloping and outrageous.

A 1980s harlequin appeared with a tuxedo jacket and trousers in partitioned blue, yellow, and light orange, with black lapels. Further examples of brightly colored masculine tailoring came with shoulder pads, and delightful compact boaters, with dainty sprigs of netting, by Stephen Jones.

One of the most beautiful looks came in a soft yellow: whirl upon whirl of the material made up the bodice, with a slinky, shiny dress below.

At the end, Jacobs, in black and white spotted shirt, took a brief bow and, at just after 7.30 p.m., six minutes after the show began, it endedan hour and a half after it should have. But, so what? Fashion Week had come to a suitably dramatic end, especially for all those hailing cabs and Ubers for the ride down to Brooklyn next for Rihanna.

As one woman said on her way out, Wow, OK, after all that waiting that was worth it. And it absolutely, fabulously, was."
2018-04-25,Daily Beast,Sean Spicer Relives Memories of Melania Trump at Bizarre Wax Figure Unveiling,"This week, all eyes have been on the French state visit in Washington, D.C., and on Melania Trump, the private first lady who has vaulted over the low bar previously set for her by wearing a huge white hat and watching her husband dig a hole. But on Wednesday morning, for a brief period of time, 20 to 25 pairs of eyes turned toward Melania Trumps wax alter ego as it was ceremoniously unveiled by Madame Tussauds New York and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.

Spring may have sprung in New York City, but the former press secretary picked a rainy, dreary day to visit the Times Square wax museum. In a busy lobby stuffed with tourists and wax celebrities, a large group of reporters assembled for the launch of Give Melania a Voice. It quickly became apparent that the only thing less pleasant than visiting Times Square in the rain is visiting Times Square in the rain to watch former press secretary Sean Spicer unveil a wax sculpture of first lady Melania Trump.

In addition to reuniting Melania with her husband in the wax Oval Office for sitting wax presidents, Madame Tussauds also unveiled a new experiential activation, where visitors are encouraged to tweet on behalf of the FLOTUS at a social media station with tweets appearing on a live feed in the attractions Oval Office set.

Of course, the assembled reporters had been lured not by the promise of staring into the wax first ladys blank, lifeless eyes, but by the announcement that Melania would be unveiled by the one and only Sean Spicer, who would also be participating in a special Q&A about his time in the White House and experience with the FLOTUS.

Representatives from some of the countrys most prestigious press outlets packed into a Madame Tussauds elevator and were led to the World Leaders Gallery. In keeping with Spicers infamously acrimonious relationship with the press, reporters were corralled into a corner of the room as visitors were encouraged to go about their sightseeing. A table of snacks was flyered with handouts advertising The Briefing, Spicers upcoming memoir (coming July 24, 2018). The flyers promised a tell-all that would take readers on a roller coaster ride through [Spicers] tenure as President Trumps spokesman. A blurb from President Trump read, [Sean Spicer is] a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media.

Logically, a person abused by the Fake News Media would not voluntarily subject themselves to a media opportunity at the Madame Tussauds wax museum. And yet, eventually, members of the press were ushered by a sunglasses-wearing security guard into a small curtained-off areathe Oval Office, now featuring the Give Melania A Voice experimental activation box. The space quickly filled with reporters, snaking their camera cords around the waxen feet of a nearby Maya Angelou. Malcolm X stood a few feet away in silent judgment as human Sean Spicer and wax Melania Trump were introduced by Merlin Entertainments Christine Haughney with equal enthusiasm.

This is the first Melania Trump figure that weve ever launched, Haughney announced, adding, Shes fantastic! We know that shes a fashion icon, we saw her earlier style this week, and shell be here actually through May 31. Haughney continued, In the vein of firsts today, we have a very special guest that we are thrilled to be welcoming, he has been kind enough to join us and help us unveil this great opportunity, so with that, and if youd all join me, wed like to welcome Mr. Sean Spicer.

Asked about his life after the White House, Spicer, a Madame Tussauds virgin, said thats hes had a great, much less stressful time traveling the country speaking to groups, doing a bunch of consulting on the side, and I have a book coming out July 24 that we launched the cover for this morning called The Briefing.

Its available for pre-order on Amazon dot com and Barnes and Noble dot com so were excited about that.

Pressed on what he had learned about the first family during his time in D.C., Spicer proceeded to list every member of said family: Youve got Don and Eric, Ivanka, Barron, Tiffany, youve got the president and the first lady. Each of them is unique in their own way.

He continued, Were obviously here today to talk about the first lady, and what an opportunity it is, because last night I think the world got to see what a great first lady she is, what impeccable taste she has, with the state visit. And its just another example of her putting on amazing events to highlight the White House and our country for the world to see. Shes a very caring and gracious woman, and our country is grateful to have her.

Most reporters questions attempted to glean personal information about Melania Trump, and seemed to prove that the first lady is as much of a cypher to people who have actually met her as she is to the rest of us. Spicer called Trump a very gracious and fashionable woman, noting, I dont think the American people have fully appreciated the level of intellect that she has and her political savviness.

She really has her finger on the pulse of whats going on politically and whats going on in the media and is able to really offer sage advice, not just about what her husband should or should not do as president, but also as individuals. She was always there to offer a helping, supportive hand, and as I mentioned, I think she is just a great first lady and does so much on behalf of our country to showcase it, in such a great phenomenal way.

At one point, clearly grasping at straws/adjectives, Spicer described Melania as very well-read, impeccable with her judgment, and always interested in whats happening. Asked to articulate one thing that everyone should know about the first lady, he offered, I think youve seen it with some of the interactions shes had with students in particular, shes really concerned about the issues that young people face these days, and obviously she has an 11-year-old son, but she really loves interacting with students and wants to make America the best country it can be for these young kids to grow up in.

As signaled by the nearby flat screen TV showcasing the cover of Spicers upcoming memoir, the former press secretary was making a wax museum appearance for the sole purpose of plugging his book. He described the writing process as therapeutic and an opportunity for reflection.

Ive said it before, but Im the kind of person that at the end of every day I sit back and try to think about, was I the best person I could be? Spicer confided. I try to live by the golden rule, treat others as the way you want to be treated, and there are some days that I didnt live up to those standards, and theres some days when I thought, wow, that was a really good day and I hope to sustain it.

As you write the book you think about who you are as a person, and those relationships that you have both professionally and personally, he continued. He disclosed that the memoir will span from his childhood through the election, the transition period, and those first eight months in the White House and what they were like.

There are a lot of moments that got a lot of coverage, and what it was like to be behind the scenes in them, what it felt like in a lot of these ways for me to go through them, he said.

Spicer also alluded to some other entertainment projects on his horizon, teasing, hopefully as we get closer to book launch therell be more to announce.

While reporters were told prior to the event that ** This event will not permit questions from media ** (emphasis Madame Tussauds), some outlets attempted to shout out questions, with mixed results. One such outburst finally got Spicer to share a concrete anecdote about Melania Trumpthe time she met with him to say goodbye at the end of his tenure, and asked him how he was. Those are the kinds of interactions that mean a lot, a touched Spicer recalled, to know that there is a deep concern for how youre doing and what youre up to next.

He insisted that hes never seen the first lady mad at the president. She was always supportive in public, he said, continuing after a pause, and in private. Asked if hed seen the couples most recent hand-holding snafu, he responded, I did. As a spouse of 14 years, Ive had my own awkward moments. But I think theres a genuine love and concern and thats whats the most important. Questions about the presidents affairs and the Comey memos went largely unanswered, with Spicer announcing that, I spend a lot less time paying attention to the news now.

After once again urging the crowd to pre-order his book, the event ended with Sean Spicer posing next to the wax president and first lady, whom he declared to be remarkably lifelike."
2018-07-19,Breitbart,Donald Trump No Confidence in Intelligence Led by Brennan Clapper Comey,"Its been terrible, Trump told CBS anchor Jeff Glor, citing the names of former CIA director John Brennan, former director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, Former Director of the National Security Agency Michael Hayden, former FBI director James Comey, as well as prominent FBI agents Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, and Peter Strzok.

The president responded to a question from Glor about whether or not he felt that former intelligence agents were out to get him. Trump said that he had difficulty trusting their judgement, as they stood vehmently against him.

Certainly I cant have any confidence in the past, Trump said, citing the all of the shenanigans that have gone on in the intelligence community under former President Barack Obama.

Very hard to have confidence in that group, he added.

Trump said Brennan was a total low-life and that said that even though Clapper wrote him a beautiful letter when he first got into the presidency, he turned against him.

All of a sudden, hes gone haywire because they got to him and they probably, got him to say things that maybe he doesnt even mean, he said.

Trump said that he was confident in the present intelligence led by his own appointees such as Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.

I can have a lot of confidence in the present and the future, because its getting to be now where were putting our people in, he said."
2018-06-19,Breitbart,Sweden Three Dead After Drive-By Shooting in Multicultural Malmo,"City authorities said that two of the victims  at least three of whom were very well known to police in a criminal context, according to local media  died overnight while another three people were injured, one seriously. Three people have died in all.

The attack took place at just after 8 pm Monday when the men were shot while leaving an internet cafe in the south-eastern part of Swedens third largest city, reported Sydsvenskan.

Witnesses said they heard around 15 to 20 shots from an automatic weapon, which was reportedly fired from a parked vehicle just a few hundred yards from a police station.

Officers are looking for a dark-coloured vehicle in which the suspect drove away from the scene following the shooting, which one witness described as looking more like an execution, as the perpetrator shot purposefully and emptied his magazine, according to descriptions to local media.

However, others said this could indicate the suspect was inexperienced at handling the weapon, noted the regional newspaper Tidningen Svegot.

Local resident Pia Berggren, who witnessed emergency services arrive at the scene, told Sydsvenskan: The sound of the gunfire was so powerful. Its the most shocking weapon you think of.

With 43 per cent of its population estimated to have a migrant background, Malmo has suffered from increasing levels of violent crime linked to gang warfare in recent years.

Noting the city is now infamous for explosions, with frequent grenade attacks, retired city police chief and INTERPOL cop Torsten Elofsson told Breitbart London that crime there has soared as a result of mass immigration.

Former soldiers now working in the citys police bomb disposal unit have said the constant grenade attacks remind them of their service in some of the war-torn regions of Iraq.

Last year, Breitbart London reported how staff working at cemeteries in the multicultural city have had to be trained to deal with armed funerals in which mourners carry weapons and don bulletproof vests to say their final goodbyes."
2018-07-31,Breitbart,CNBC Survey 59 Approve Trumps Handling of Economy Most Say US Will Win Trade War,"Economic growth is seen as hitting nearly 3 percent in 2018, according to the survey. The S&P 500 is expected to rise about 6 percent, while both inflation and unemployment are seen as staying low. The yield on the 10-year is seen as rising to about 3.5 percent by the end of 2019, up from about 2.95 percent today.

Unsurprisingly, most of the participants in the CNBC Fed survey are not fans of tariffs, with 59 percent saying it will reduce economic growth and 54 percent saying it will reduce employment.

Perhaps more surprising is how small they think the economic impact will be. On average, they see the current round of tariffs and retaliation as reducing annual growth by around one-tenth of a percentage point. That would mean a 3.5 percent economy would grow at 3.4 percent instead, not optimal but not a catastrophe. Even if all the tariffs currently contemplated were put in place, the total effect would take just three-tenths of a percentage point off growth.

Perhaps because of how small of an impact tariffs would have, most economists think the U.S. is by far most likely to prevail in trade disputes with Canada, China, and the European Union.

Of course, if economic growth were lower, the effects of tariffs would be more perilous. Shrinking a 2 percent economy to a 1.6 percent economy would likely spark recession fears. This underlines the importance of Trumps tax cuts and regulatory reforms, and undermines the critics who said the economy did not need additional economic stimulus. The stimulus created by the tax cuts gave the American economy more resilience in the face of trade disputes."
2018-06-14,Breitbart,GOP Immigration Deal Potentially Biggest Amnesty in US History,"Ryans immigration deal would go beyond giving amnesty to only the nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

According to a leaked draft of the amnesty deal, obtained by Breitbart News, Ryans plan would allow the entire DACA population to be eligible for amnesty so long as they meet low educational, work and criminal requirements, prompting the amnesty to explode in size.

That DACA population could include the nearly 3.5 million DACA-enrolled and DACA-eligible illegal aliens, and even more illegal aliens who arrive in the U.S. to fraudulently obtain the amnesty.

NumbersUSA Governmental Affairs Director Rosemary Jenks told Breitbart News that Ryans amnesty will  at the least  allow 1.8 million illegal aliens to stay in the U.S.

This has the potential to turn into the biggest amnesty weve ever had, Jenks said.

The leaked amnesty deal reveals that Ryan and the Republican establishment may even be considering going beyond giving amnesty to DACA illegal aliens.

A second amnesty is included in the leaked draft, one that would allow the children of temporary foreign guest workers and anyone who has a contingent nonimmigrant status' to apply for the amnesty.

This amnesty for the children of temporary foreign workers does not have a numerical cap, allowing for an endless amount of foreign nationals to obtain amnesty through this avenue known as Pathway Concept B.

The winners are the DREAMers cause they get their amnesty, Democrats because they dont have to concede much to get the amnesty and donor-class Republicans who are interested in perpetuating the current system, Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan told Breitbart News of Ryans leaked amnesty deal.

Unknown are the numbers of illegal aliens who will surge the United States-Mexico border at the enactment of such an amnesty plan.

Previously, Kansas Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach told Breitbart News that a DACA amnesty  even one smaller than this amnesty plan  would potentially cause a surge of one million illegal immigrants rushing the southern border.

Kobach told Breitbart News that Ryans leaked amnesty plan is a nightmare for Americans.

The draft amnesty for the DREAMers is a nightmare for the American people. It is not limited to the 700,000 known DACA recipients, Kobach said. Instead, it appears to encompass an unlimited number of people, many of whom will claim fraudulently that they meet the minimal requirements to receive the amnesty.

As Breitbart News reported, the Republican establishment and White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short are attempting to stampede President Trump into the amnesty deal by pushing it through the House and Senate quickly, much like the trillion dollar omnibus spending bill  which did not fund the presidents border wall."
2018-07-02,Breitbart,WaPos Rubin Sarah Sanders Life Sentence Should Be Being Made Uncomfortable,"During the Sunday broadcast of MSNBCs AM Joy, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin declared White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders life sentence for being in President Donald Trumps administration and inciting against the press should be being made uncomfortable.

[N]o one is telling them to be violent protesters, but were not going to let these people go through life unscathed, Rubin told host Joy Reid. Sarah Huckabee has no right to live a life of no fuss, no muss, after lying to the press, after inciting against the press. These people should be made uncomfortable, and I think thats a life sentence, frankly."
2018-07-28,Breitbart,ExclusiveTom MacArthur I Want Strong Secure Borders Andy Kim Wants Open Borders,"MacArthur, a two-term congressman, faces off against Andy Kim, a Democrat with far-left ties who has tried to paint himself as a moderate. Kim founded and serves as the board of director of Rise Stronger, a far-left group dedicated to resisting President Donald Trumps agenda. MacArthur even pointed out that Andy Kim has been endorsed by the New Jersey Communist Party.

Congressman MacArthur told Breitbart News, You got to his website and hes aligned himself with resistance groups that have called for jihad against the United States, promoting books by cop killers, and 9/11 conspiracy theorists, domestic terrorists, I could go on, but this is a guy who is raising a lot of money so he can paint himself as a moderate.

Rep. MacArthur said that Kims organization has promoted books written by cop killers such as Mumia Abu-Jamal, anti-Semites, 9/11 conspiracy theorists, and domestic terrorists such as Bill Ayers.

On one occasion in July, Kim refused 16 times to answer whether he would support abolishing ICE and then later admitted that he would oppose abolishing the nations immigration enforcement agency.

The New Jersey Republican then suggested that Kims unwillingness to answer whether he would support abolishing ICE shows that he is split between whether to support his far-left allies or whether to continue presenting as a moderate Democrat.

I think his unwillingness to answer that question until someone scripted him is really telling. He was asked 16 times and then waited days before [saying whether] he would abolish ICE or not, MacArthur contended. It would take me a nanosecond to answer that question; its where most illegal drugs are coming fromover the southern border. We have criminals over the southern borders, and these people want open borders, just shut down the law enforcement agency thats helping them.

Congressman MacArthur also chastised his Democratic opponent for filing his taxes in Washington, DC, to receive a tax break on his nearly $1 million condo.

At the same time, he repeatedly told New Jerseyans that he lives here and vote here and run for office here, and at the same time told Washington, DC, that he lived there so he could take a significant tax break on his $900,000 condo in Washington, MacArthur told Breitbart News. Hes a tax cheat, and when he got caught, he had to write them a check.

MacArthur said that Kim also flip-flopped on his support for President Trumps Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The American Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose to 4.1 percent in the second quarter of 2018, which is the fastest rate since 2014.

This isnt the first time he delayed on thishe totally resisted the tax cuts until he found out the people in the district might like them and then said, I might not be so quick to overturn them, MacArthur said.

In contrast, MacArthur said, People know where I stand whether they agree or disagree with me, I am straight with folks, I think I owe them that. I supported the tax cuts because I think they were good for the country and I think they were good for my state. Youre now seeing the resultslow unemployment, high growth, this is an economic boom for the country.

After Paul Ryan failed to get the original Obamacare repeal effort, otherwise known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), through the House last year, then-Tuesday Group co-chairman MacArthur teamed up with House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) to pass an overhauled Obamacare repeal package through the House.

I tried to improve the health care system; my opponent wants a government-run healthcare system, I think its a rotten idea, MacArthur explained. I dont want a healthcare system with all of the friendliness of the IRS. Thats bad for my constituents.

The New Jersey Republican did not endorse House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) to replace the outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan. However, MacArthur said he has done a lot of work with Jim Jordan and we are friends, and I also have a lot of respect for Kevin, hes a smart guy.

Congressman MacArthur said that, if re-elected to Congress, he will work towards cutting burdensome taxes and regulations and ensuring a strong border, while suggesting that his opponent would push for impeachment of President Trump, abolishing ICE, and socialized medicine.

MacArthur said, First, I would continue to push for getting past Washington dysfunction and getting things actually done. One, I think that we need to stand strong on the world stage, I am committed to strong, secure borders, we cannot have people wandering into the country when they want to, we cannot have drugs and gang members and others coming into the country because we do not have the fortitude to protect our borders.

The Congressman continued, I think for Andy Kim, its impeachment, theres no question if the Democrats take over the House that they will move to take out the president, he will support Nancy Pelosi and will support that agenda. Eliminating or weakening ICE to the point where we cannot protect our borders is something that he will no doubt push for. He will push for a European-style takeover of health care, socialized medicine."
2018-02-13,Breitbart,Report Trumps Proposed Budget Nixes Federal Funding for NPR PBS,"The Hill reported that Trumps budget would cut funding for CPB  which funds public television and radio stations such as PBS and NPR  over two years.

To conduct an orderly transition away from Federal funding, the Budget requests $15.5 million in 2019 and $15 million in 2020, which would include funding for personnel costs of $16.2 million, rental costs of $8.9 million; and other costs totaling $5.4 million, according to the proposal.

CPB grants represent a small share of the total funding for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR), which primarily rely on private donations to fund their operations, the proposal continued.

CPB received $445 million in federal funding, according to the most recent data available from the organization. Those federal funds made up 15 percent of PBS funding and ten percent of funding for NPR radio broadcasting.

Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of CPB, released a statement Monday decrying Trumps plan to defund CPB.

Since there is no viable substitute for federal funding that would ensure this valued service continues, the elimination of federal funding to CPB would at first devastate, and then ultimately destroy public medias ability to provide early childhood content, life-saving emergency alerts, and public affairs programs, Harrison said.

We will continue to raise awareness in Congress and the Administration about the valued content and services local public television and radio stations provide to their communities and the vital role federal funding plays in supporting them, she added.

Paula Kerger, PBSs president and CEO, also released a statement Monday saying that the organization would continue to remind lawmakers of public televisions value to taxpayers.

Public broadcasting has earned bipartisan Congressional support over the years thanks to the value we provide to taxpayers, Kerger said. PBS, our 350 member stations and our legions of local supporters will continue to remind leaders in Washington of the significant benefits the public receives in return for federal funding, a modest investment of about $1.35 per citizen per year.

When Trump proposed his 2018 budget last year, his goal was to eliminate discretionary spending for arts, public television, and public radio programs."
2018-06-16,Breitbart,Otto Warmbiers Parents Move Lawsuit Against North Korea Forward,"Despite President Donald Trumps recent meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, Fred and Cindy Warmbier will press ahead with a lawsuit claiming that their son was brutally tortured and murdered by the communist regime.

The summit doesnt affect what were doing at all, said the familys attorney, Richard Cullen. Were moving full speed ahead. Theyre looking forward to their day in court, where they can prove that Ottos death was the result of his brutal treatment at the hands of the North Koreans.

Although U.S. citizens are not typically allowed to sue other countries, North Koreas status as a State Department-designated state sponsor of terrorism allows people to file legal challenges through the courts.

Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, was originally sentenced to 15 years hard labor for allegedly stealing pro-government paraphernalia from his hotel while on a trip to North Korea in March 2016. However, he was sent back to the United States last June in a coma and appeared to have suffered extensive brain damage, and he died over a week later.

Obviously, this has been an unimaginable, painful, horrific experience, and they feel very strongly that the North Korean regime should be held accountable for the death of their boy, Cullen continued. They feel theres no better venue for that than a United States court.

Trump indicated on Tuesday that Warmbiers death led to his recent summit with Kim Jong-un in which both the U.S. and North Korea agreed to embrace a new era of peace and work towards a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.

Something happened from that day. It was a terrible thing. It was brutal. But a lot of people started to focus on what was going on, including North Korea, Trump said. I really think that Otto is someone who did not die in vain.

We appreciate President Trumps recent comments about our family, Warmbiers parents said in response. We are proud of Otto and miss him. Hopefully, something positive can come from this.

Since their sons death, the pair railed against the North Korean regime in their sons memory.

North Korea is not a victim, Fred Warmbier said in an interview with Fox News last year. Theyre terrorists. They kidnapped Otto, they tortured him, they intentionally injured him. They are not victims. Theyre terrorists."
2018-07-03,Breitbart,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Illegal Aliens Deserve Right of Passage to Freely Enter US,"Last week, Ocasio delivered an upset to establishment Democratic power player Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in the districts primary election, running on a platform that promises to abolish all immigration and border enforcement.

Now, in an interview with AJ+, owned by the Al Jazeera Media Network, Ocasio says that not only should the U.S. abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency  which is tasked with enforcing interior immigration laws  but that foreign nationals, border crossers, and illegal aliens are entitled to enter the U.S.

I think that immigration should be safe. I think that we should grant people a safe and documented right of passage. Republicans try all these scare tactics. And they go Oh, open borders. Because theyre trying to incite fear. But what we really need to do is demilitarize a lot of whats going on in terms of the detention of people, which has been happening for a very long time by the way. [Emphasis added] So I think that when we talk about replacing it with a system, we talk about having a system that is safe, that documents people effectively, that is also not rooted in the discrimination that our immigration system was initially built on. [Emphasis added] The first immigration law in the United States was the Chinese Exclusion Act. The first law about immigration in the United States was about how do we exclude a specific type of people. And our immigration system has really kind of evolved from that initial root and I dont think it necessarily has to be that way. [Emphasis added]

Ocasio is increasingly shaping the Democratic Partys open borders platform ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Since her beating of Crowley in the Bronx, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended.

House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been purged from the Democratic party for failing to endorse the abolish ICE campaign like his fellow left-wingers such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S. Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, said they do not want ICE to be disbanded, as Breitbart News reported. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.

Even Democrat voters are opposed to the abolishment of ICE. Nearly 60 percent of Democrats said they do not want ICE to be disbanded.

Abolishing the deportation agency, as Breitbart News reported, would have allowed more than 1.6 million illegal aliens to have gone free throughout the U.S. in the last five years."
2018-07-21,Breitbart,Schiff Trump Gravest Threat to Our Democracy Ive Seen in My Life - Quite Possible Russia Has D,"During an interview with Yahoo News Skullduggery podcast released on Friday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA) stated

Schiff said, Why would the president undermine NATO? Why would the president undermine Europe? Why would the president talk about bringing Russia back into the G8, when they still occupy their neighbor? Why would the president do all these things? Why would the president deny the obvious, that the Russians intervened in our election? You know, it could be that there is just some pathology at work with him, that he is so terrified that his election was illegitimate that he is responding in this way. So maybe theres a pathology. But its also quite possible that the Russians have compromising material on him, that the Russians were laundering money through his businesses, and he knows that, and they know that. Its also quite possible that the president believes the Russians have compromising information on him. ... But in terms of the United States and our national security and our interests, what matters most is the presidents actions. And he is acting like someone compromised.

He later added, [O]ne of the terrible realizations of the last year and a half for me is that the damage that the Russians have done to our democracy, by meddling in our election, is nothing compared to the damage our own president is doing to our democracy by attacking the Justice Department and by denigrating our press, which, you know, in the same full-throated endorsement of the Kremlin, he attacks the real enemy, our free press. So, yes, I think that he is doing enormous damage to our national security beyond anything the Russians could do to us.

Schiff further stated, I view this president as the gravest threat to our democracy that Ive seen, certainly, in my lifetime."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,France Hits Out at Polands Ill Advised Holocaust Law,"This law is ill advised, you should not rewrite history, its never a very good idea, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told BFM television.

Asked if the EU would take measures in response to the controversial Holocaust law, signed into law by Polands President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday, Le Drian said he hoped moral pressure will be sufficient.

I also hope that the Polish people will reconsider, and in the next elections act in a way that removes the unfortunate political straitjacket imposed by nationalist factions, he said.

Anything that could pervert this memory is negative, he said, saying the vote to bring in the law should be condemned.

The bill has drawn a chorus of criticism from countries including Israel and the United States.

It sets fines or a maximum three-year jail term for anyone ascribing responsibility or co-responsibility to the Polish nation or state for crimes committed by the German Third Reich  or other crimes against humanity and war crimes.

The main aim is to prevent people from erroneously describing Nazi German death camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau as Polish, simply because they were set up on Polish soil.

Israel has expressed deep concerns that the legislation could open the door to prosecuting Holocaust survivors for their testimony should it concern the involvement of individual Poles for allegedly killing or giving up Jews to the Germans.

But Duda and other Polish leaders say the law does not limit freedom of speech on Holocaust issues that are based in historical fact.

Duda also said he would send the legislation to the Constitutional Tribunal to rule on whether it conforms with guarantees for freedom of speech."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Another Win for Donald Trump FIFA Votes for 2026 World Cup in North America,"The president celebrated the news on Twitter on Wednesday.

Trump took an unusual interest in America co-hosting the soccer match, urging world leaders to support North Americas bid to host the game.

The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup, Trump wrote in April on Twitter. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid.

Trump also personally urged African countries to support the bid for the World Cup.

I hope all African countries and countries throughout the world, that we also will be supporting you and that they will likewise support us in our bid, along with Canada and Mexico, for the 2026 World Cup, Trump said in a joint press conference with Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari.

The FIFA federation held a vote in Moscow giving it to North America with a vote of 134-65 over Morocco."
2018-10-01,Breitbart,Kill Kavanaugh Tops Twitter Search and Hashtag Suggestions,"Thats right  by typing a single letter into search, Twitter is suggesting that its users might be interested in a hashtag about the murder of a federal judge and SCOTUS nominee.

The search suggestion was spotted by Instapundit earlier today and has been confirmed by Breitbart News.

KillKavanaugh search suggestions were also observed by Breitbart News in seemingly harmless searches for ki and k.

In hashtag suggestions, #KillKavanaugh currently tops the list of suggestions when users type #Ki.

Although many current tweets on the hashtag are critical of both the hashtag and Twitters double standards, earlier tweets use the hashtag unironically and uncritically. Several of these tweets have not been removed by Twitter, and the accounts that tweeted them do not appear to have been punished by Twitter in any way, despite the fact that some users say they have reported them.

It can be argued that some  but not all  of these tweets are metaphorical, calling for the nomination to be killed rather than the person, in the same way that a piece of legislation might be metaphorically killed. But refusing to take action against those tweets would still be an example of Twitters double standards: the platform has in the past permanently banned free speech maximalist users when they employed similar metaphors, using the least charitable interpretation of their remarks. This is the website that has silenced James Woods for tweeting a meme about soy boys that Jack Dorsey and his San Francisco menagerie argue could impact an election.

Twitter has in the past been slow or unwilling to address abusive or violent tweets against conservatives and Republicans. When the daughters of Islam critic Pamela Geller were bombarded with abuse earlier this year, Twitter did nothing. In fact, some of the abusive tweets remain on the site, undeleted. In 2016, death threats against sitting Republican senators were allowed to remain on the platform for weeks.

Meanwhile, Twitter continues to permanently ban top conservative commentators and activists simply for posting unwelcome facts, severely hampering the conservative grassroots ability to mobilize supporters ahead of crucial elections.

Breitbart News reached out to Twitter for comment but has not received a response.

2018-02-11,Breitbart,Olympic Venue Surrounded by Dog Meat Farms Dog Soup on Menus Despite Protests,"South Koreans are believed to consume about one million dogs a year as a summertime delicacy, with the greasy red meat  which is invariably boiled for tenderness  believed to increase energy. Activists have stepped up campaigns to ban dog consumption, with online petitions urging boycotts of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics over the issue, and protests in Seoul. Local authorities asked the 12 dog meat restaurants in Pyeongchang county to stop serving the food during the games, in exchange for subsidies. But only two have complied, Pyeongchang County government official Lee Yong-bae told AFP.

Weve faced a lot of complaints from restaurant operators that we are threatening their livelihood, the official said.

Some of them initially shifted to selling pork or things instead of dog meat only to find their sales plunging sharply, he said. They then switched back to dog meat.

The animal activists fighting the Korean dog meat trade include EK Park, who founded Free Korean Dogs.

Right now, Canadian figure skater Meagan Duhamel and partner Eric Radford are in first place in pair skating, and their Canadian skating team is also in first place.

But a year ago, while she and Radford were in South Korea for another competition, Park arranged for Duhamel to adopt Moo-tae, a dachshund mix that was rescued by Buddhist monks as a puppy from a farm in the southern part of the country.

Park, who was born in South Korea but now lives in Toronto, helped rescue 240 dogs last year, a process that includes volunteers who are willing to accompany the dogs on flights to forever homes in Canada and the United States.

The 2-year-old pup has been living with her and husband/coach Bruno Marcotte in Montreal since, spending his days doing yoga with Duhamel and making friends at the local dog park. Its been a different life for Moo-tae. Like roughly 2 million dogs each year, he was supposed to be raised on a Korean dog meat farm, where conditions are often poor. Moo-tae may have been locked in a cage, beaten or left without food or water. Certainly, he would have been sold and slaughtered, then probably served in soup at one of many restaurants still popular among Koreas elderly population.

He loved to sit with the Buddhas during meditation and yoga, Duhamel said. I thought, Oh my God, maybe this dog has some special spiritual energy.

That was really why I chose him, Duhamel said."
2018-08-01,Breitbart,Economic Patriotism GOP Voters Vastly Support Trumps Aid to US Farmers,"In a new CBS News/YouGov Poll, nearly 80 percent of Republican voters said they support the Trump administrations decision to give economic relief to U.S. farmers whose goods have been hit with retaliatory tariffs from China, designed to hurt the American industry.

Only 22 percent of Republican voters said they opposed the economic aid to U.S. farmers.

The poll reveals yet again that there is little support for economic libertarianism within the Republican Party. Though a majority GOP lawmakers continue to demand free trade and an end to tariffs on imported foreign-made products, Republican voters are increasingly economic nationalists.

In the latest Harvard/Harris Poll, 83 percent of Republican voters say they support tariffs on imported products like automobiles and electronics. Additionally, 81 percent of conservatives said they too supported tariffs, along with 61 percent of Americans living in rural communities.

A Morning Consult Poll conducted in July revealed that nearly half of Republican voters believe the U.S. has benefitted the least from the countrys current free trade deals like NAFTA and KORUS. Additionally, a plurality of Republicans  46 percent  said the U.S. economy benefits more from imposing tariffs on foreign-made goods to protect domestic industries, while only 30 percent said the U.S. economy benefits more from lowering trade barriers and entering into free trade deals.

As Breitbart News reported, California farmers said they appreciate Trumps aid to their industry as the administration battles China for fair trade."

2018-02-06,Breitbart,Democrat Adam Schiff Fell for Russian Prankster Spoof Promising Compromising Dirt on Donald Trump,"Schiff found the early 2017 call with the Russian pranksters, who posed as Ukrainian leaders, productive, one of his staffers wrote in an email to the Russians-posing-as-Ukrainians with whom he was communicating. Now, after getting caught in the media by reports in the Atlantic magazine and the U.K. Daily Mail newspaperas well as audio of the call appearing on YouTubea Schiff spokesperson claims the powerful Democrat congressman thought the call was bogus from the beginning. But thats not what the record shows.

LISTEN TO THE AUDIO OF ADAM SCHIFF WITH RUSSIAN PRANKSTERS:

The notorious Russian pranksters, who the Daily Mails Alana Goodman notes are comedians nicknamed Vovan and Lexus who have become famous for their phony calls to high-ranking American officials and celebrities, including UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Elton John, posed as leading Ukrainian officials in their call to Schiff in early 2017.

On an audio recording of the prank call posted online, Adam Schiff can be heard discussing the committees Russia investigation and increasingly bizarre allegations about Trump with a man who claimed to be Andriy Parubiy, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament, Goodman wrote in the Daily Mail.

As Goodman noted, the calls existence was first reported by the Atlantics Julia Ioffewho noted that the call took place in early April 2017. Ioffe wrote:

The call, per the audio available on YouTube, begins with platitudes and introductions and Schiff thanks the man he thinks is Parubiy for his time addressing him as Mr. Chairman.

The man then pitches that he wants to provide materials to Schiff for his committees investigation on Trump and the Russian government, to which Schiff cautions him that the Russians were likely listening to the call.

I would just caution that our Russian friends may be listening to the conversation, so I wouldnt share anything over the phone that you dont want them to hear, Schiff said.

After the Russian prankster posing as the Ukrainian official said he had no concerns with what the Russians may or may not hear, he proceeded to tell Schiff about what would have been explosive allegations against the now-sitting president of the United States if they were true.

In November 2013, Mr. Trump visited Moscow, he visited competition Miss Universe, and there he met with Russian journalist and celebrity Ksenia Sobchak, the prankster said.

Sobchak has extensive ties to Putin, the prankster told Schiff, adding that she is also known as a person who provides girls for escort for oligarchs. And she met with Trump and she brought him one Russian girl, celebrity Olga Buzova. The prankster even told Schiff that Sobchak is a special agent of Russian secret service.

In reality, Sobchak is actually anti-Putinan ex-Playboy model running against the Russian president on an anti-corruption platform after her time as a television anchor. But no matter to Schiff; he was entranced by the possibility of kompromat on Trump.

After, per the Russian pranksters posing as Ukrainian officials in their conversation with Schiff, Sobchak introduced Trump to Buzova, Buzova got compromising materials on Trump after their short relations.

There were pictures of naked Trump, the prankster said.

Schiff, per the Atlantic report, betrayed no emotion.

And so Putin was made aware of the availability of the compromising material? Schiff asked the man he thought was a Ukrainian leader.

Yes, of course, the prankster replied, adding that Putin told Trump all those compromising materials will never be released if Trump will cancel all Russian sanctions.

Adding insult to injury, the pranksters convinced Schiff that they had a recording of Sobchak and Buzov discussing this during a recent visit to Ukraine and that the Ukrainian officials would provide said recording to the FBI and the House Intelligence Committees Democratic minority staff.

But thats not all. The pranksters told Schiff that Trumps ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn met with Russians in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn speaking in code words. From the Atlantic piece, here is more:

Schiff told the men he thought were Ukrainian officials that what they had told him was very helpful.

All righty. Good, this is very helpful. I appreciate it, Schiff said. He also pushed for the release of the evidence that the pranksters invented for their stunt to the FBI and the House committee for which Schiff is ranking member.

We will try to work with the FBI to figure out, along with your staff, how we can obtain copies, Schiff said.

Whats more, after the call, Schiff told his staff that it was productive and told them to follow up with the pranksters-they-thought-were Ukrainians.

I understand Mr. Schiff had a productive call with Mr. Parubiy, and that Mr. Parubiy would like to make some materials available to Mr. Schiff through your Embassy, Rheanne Wirkkala of the House Intelligence Committee minority staffSchiffs teamwrote to the pranksters that Schiffs team still thought were Ukrainian officials. That email was sent in the early days of April 2017.

Wirkkala is no low-level staffer. She is, per her LinkedIn page, the policy director for the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.

Wirkkala sent a second email during the Democrats correspondence with these Russian pranksters that Schiff and the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee originally thought were Ukrainian officials that further illustrates that for several days Schiff and his team thought this was real.

In the April 5, 2017, email, Wirkalla asked the men she and Schiff thought were Ukrainian officials: do you know when we might be able to meet your colleagues at the Ukrainian embassy here in Washington, DC to pick up materials?

Now, upon the release of this call in the Atlantic and Daily Mail, and the recording of it on YouTube, Schiffs team is claiming he always knew it was bogus.

Before agreeing to take the call, and immediately following it, the committee informed appropriate law-enforcement and security personnel of the conversation, and of our belief that it was probably bogus, a Schiff spokesperson told the Atlantic.

In a statement to the Daily Mail, the Schiff spokesperson added more: Obviously, it was bogus  which became even more evident during the call  but as with any investigation that is global in scale, we have to chase any number of leads, many of which turn out to be duds.

But as the Daily Mails Goodman noted, Schiffs team has declined to respond to the fact that Schiffs policy director called the call productive and moved forward with seeking the production of the fake evidence in emails post-call with the pranksters.

The spokesperson declined to address on the record why a staff member pursued the politician after the call if the congressman thought it was fake, Goodman wrote.

It remains to be seen what the fallout here is, but Schiffs office has yet to provide any explanation for the emails and how he handled the actual call. But top Republicans are already pouncing on this demanding that he be sidelined from his role on the committee after this embarrassing development.

Schiff getting removed from his committee role would have drastically negative consequences on the Democrats efforts to stick Trump with the Russia scandal anymore. He has been the public face of the investigation, appearing relentlessly on television and in the media to push it forwardand even fundraising off of Breitbart News articles about his actions."
2018-07-24,Breitbart,Stripe PayPal Patreon The Right Is Being Banned from Online Fundraising,"Conservatives have long been the target of shadowbans, biased algorithms, and account bans on social media. Not content with silencing their voices online, the left now wants to stop the right from using the web to fundraise. Thanks to the increasing willingness of online fundraising platforms and payment processors to ban clients for political reasons, they are getting their way.

One of the most popular fundraising platforms is Patreon, a site that allows users to collect monthly recurring donations from their supporters. With the decline of ad revenue on platforms like YouTube, Patreon has emerged as an important and effective tool for online content creators to earn a living. In some cases, it can take little more than a hundred fans contributing set amounts per month for a creator to support themselves full-time.

In theory, this creates an environment similar to that of talk radio in the 1980s: a decentralized ecosystem where new creators can quickly establish an independent support base, without relying on gatekeepers in the establishment media. With only their fans to answer to, as opposed to controversy-shy advertisers, it should be the perfect formula for free expression.

Theres just one problem  Patreon itself. Like the rest of Silicon Valley, Patreon has decided it wants to be more than just a neutral platform, and now routinely cuts off income from content creators for political reasons. Chief among them is hate speech, which Patreon says it does not tolerate on its platform. It has used hate speech as a justification to ban a number of figures on the far-right, including white nationalist Jason Kessler. But although the alt-right is shunned by most, including Breitbart News, the idea that politics should dictate whether someone is allowed to access financial services is even more controversial.

As is often the case, banning extremists was the start of a slippery slope. Patreons purge quickly escalated beyond the alt-right to target independent conservative journalists. The latest example is YouTuber and author Brittany Pettibone, who was banned from the platform last month. Patreon cited her support for the European identitarian organization Generation Identity, a group Patreon claims is a violent organization. (The organization explicitly disavows political violence.)

Patreon also banned the independent journalist Lauren Southern in 2017 over her work exposing globalist NGOs assisting the illegal trafficking of persons into Europe via the Mediterranean. Patreon said her work could cause loss of life by stopping the work of NGO rescue vessels  but migrant deaths in the Mediterranean actually fell by 40 percent as attempted crossings declined in the wake of her reporting. Also, if interfering with the illegal activities of NGO vessels in the Mediterranean is unacceptable to Patreon, they should make it clear that the governments of Italy and Malta, which now bar NGO ships from their shores, arent welcome on the platform either.

In the bans documented above, Patreon used tenuous, insufficiently supported accusations of violence to suspend services to right-wingers. But with the exception of one token ban against Its Going Down, a far-left site that encourages and celebrates political violence, the platform does not appear to apply its rules to the left with the same level of strictness.

British left-winger Mike Stuchbery currently collects donations from Patreon. Yet he has repeatedly encouraged and supported violence on his Twitter account, most recently defending an incident in which a teenage Trump supporter was attacked and robbed in a Whataburger restaurant for wearing a MAGA hat. Although he later backtracked on those statements, Stuchbery has also said that Trump supporters are the modern-day equivalent of Nazi brownshirts and that Nazis should be punched.

Patreon insists that Generation Identity, which publicly disavows violence, is violent, and went so far as to ban Brittanny Pettibone simply for expressing support for the group. But Stuchbery, who uses Twitter to openly defend violence, is allowed to continue using Patreon.

Its not hard to find more examples like Stuchbery. Heidi Culliman is a far-left author who has over 200 supporters on Patreon. She has also called her member of congress a Nazi, has called the President and the current U.S. administration Nazis, and, you guessed it, has called for punching Nazis. When people say the President is a Nazi, and that Nazis should be punched, that isnt just a problem for Patreon  its a problem for the Secret Service.

Maybe Stuchbery, Culliman, and other violence-supporters who collect Patreon donations might clarify that they only want actual white supremacists like Richard Spencer to be punched, and not the President (they havent yet, by the way). But you dont get a pass to punch someone like Spencer just because theyre morally wrong. Punching actual white supremacists, unless they punch you first, is still unprovoked violence, and advocating for it is still against the law, as well as Patreons policies (if they were enforced consistently.)

Patreons bias can also be seen in its approach to Antifa, a far-left organization that, much like Stuchbery and Culliman, supports the use of violence against people they determine to be fascists. As you might expect, those are frequently just ordinary Trump supporters and conservatives. Antifas rampages at pro-Trump events, where random acts of violence are accompanied by widespread looting and damage to private property, have in the past caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. Last year, an Antifa member pled guilty to plotting an acid attack on Trump supporters during the Presidential inauguration.

The U.S. government isnt keen on these self-appointed fascist-fighters, and has categorized Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. Yet its a domestic terrorist organization that is still allowed on Patreon. A cursory search of Patreon reveals at least six [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] pages, some of them boasting dozens of regular contributors, which are affiliated with Antifa, express their support for Antifa, or display the movements symbol, the red-and-white anarcho-communist flag.

One of these pages, LibCom.org, defended violent attacks on German police with glass bottles and rocks during the 2017 G20 protests in Hamburg as large-scale resistance and basic self-defense via a blog named Victory of the People. True to the Antifa designation as domestic terrorists, LibCom also published a story celebrating the sabotage of U.S. army materials. Patreon, which takes a cut from the sites donations, is directly profiting from this material.

Patreon is also directly profiting from the following image, which Antifa California is distributing through the platform as a reward to supporters:

The image of a bike lock is a reference to Eric Clanton, the left-wing professor and Antifa member accused of assaulting a Trump supporter with a bike lock in April 2017. Clanton was arrested on assault charges, and faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted.

Patreon, in other words, allows Antifa to glorify a real act of violence for which someone was arrested and charge. Meanwhile, Lauren Southern was banned because of a tenuous and ultimately debunked theory that her actions might cause harm.

Patreons double standards go beyond its inability to clamp down on left-wing support for violence. In February, Patreon banned the account of Jeremy Hambly, a critic of the incursion of progressivism into the community associated with the popular card game Magic the Gathering (yes, the culture wars now extend to card games  read more about it here). Patreon said they banned Hambly for doxing, or the release of a persons private information online, a charge Hambly denies.

Whether the charge is true or false  and the Southern incident suggests Patreon is disingenuous in its allegations of rule-breaking against the right  the Hambly ban again reveals Patreons inconsistency. The platform has for years refused to take action against Randi Harper, a serial bully who poses as an anti-abuse activist, but who herself has a long, well-documented track record of abusing others. This extends to doxing, which Harper has unapologetically used as an intimidation tactic. She once revealed the CEO of a debt collection agencys home phone number, and threatened to release those of his family if the debt collectors did not stop trying to contact her (doing their job, in other words.) Despite this well-publicized behavior, Patreon has taken no action against Harper to this day.

Patreon isnt the only way to raise money on the web. There are other fundraising platforms, including Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, and GoFundMe, which allow users to raise money for their projects. GoFundMe, in particular, has emerged as a popular method for activists, who use it to raise money for causes and campaigns.

But if youre looking for a neutral platform that doesnt come with the risk of a politically-motivated ban, these services are no better than Patreon. All have publicly committed to interfering in their users activities if they offend the companys progressive values.

Earlier this year, Kickstarter banned the project of a Swedish academic who was raising funds for a book examining the statistical correlation between immigration and rape in Sweden. The academic, Ann Heberlein, said she started the project because the Swedish government no longer keeps adequate records of the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of offenders in the country.

IndieGoGo, another crowdfunding site, explicitly bans any campaign that promotes hate or promotes hate symbols and/or hate terms on their website, as defined by the Anti-defamation league. (The Anti-defamation league, which has previously blamed Trump supporters for rising anti-semitism, includes the internet meme Pepe the Frog on their list of hate symbols.) IndieGoGo also has a blanket ban on crowdfunding for weapons, ammunition, and related accessories.

GoFundMe also takes sides politically. It deleted the fundraising campaign of a Christian-owned bakery from Oregon, which was at the time facing a $135,000 fine for refusing to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. GoFundMe has also deleted conservative Jamie Glazovs fundraiser for an anti-Sharia law tour, a campaign to expose Hillary Clintons anti-Israel sentiments during the 2016 election, and a fundraiser by an organizer of the Draw Muhammed contest which aimed to cover security costs for his family.

Its not difficult to build a website. If all existing online fundraising services have been co-opted by censor-happy progressives, why not build competing services that dont ban users for political reasons? When you dont like whats on offer, build your own. Thats the free-market conservative argument.

But its not as simple as that.

In order to build a fundraising platform, you need a payments processor. And the market for payments processors is dominated by just two companies: PayPal and Stripe. And theyre just as intolerant as the fundraising platforms.

When Lauren Southern was banned from Patreon, she did what free-market conservatives recommended, and set up her own fundraising platform, powered by Stripe. Then, directly after Southern hit the headlines again over her lifetime ban from the U.K. for distributing leaflets satirizing Islam, Stripe abruptly withdrew their service.

Stripe informed Southern that she was banned for violating their rules on Prohibited Businesses and Activities, although they did not highlight precisely how she violated it. The list includes a prohibition on activity that encourages, promotes or celebrates unlawful violence toward any group based on race, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, or any other immutable characteristic.

Stripe has also withdrawn services from FreeStartr, an alternative to Patreon and GoFundMe set up by free speech maximalist Chuck Johnson. Johnson says the platform has also been banned by PayPal. Already notorious for freezing WikiLeaks account in 2011, PayPal also withdrew services from nationalist YouTuber Faith Goldy earlier this week.

Because of the lack of a payment processor, all of FreeStartrs funds are now at risk, including a legal defense fund for jailed British Islam critic Tommy Robinson, a support fund for South African farmers at risk of racial violence, and income streams for various mainstream conservatives like organizer Ali Alexander and YouTuber Ashton Whitty.

Johnson says Stripe accused him of obfuscating funds, although the company did not respond to a request to comment asking them to elaborate on the allegation.

Johnson also says Stripe changed their story. He says he was initially contacted by senior Stripe employee Edwin Wee, a former Democrat operative who previously worked for Joe Sestak and Mike Bloomberg, who informed him that the presence of a legal defense fund for white supremacist Richard Spencer meant that Stripe could no longer do business with him. Because of one objectionable fund, the entire platform had to go.

Everyone will think like, oh its Richard Spencer, he can go f*** himself  but they shut down my entire business over his account, said Johnson, who claims his goal is to build an open, neutral platform, and not to personally endorse the people who use it.

My position on this is simple, its the same position the ACLU had in Skokie. said Johnson in comments to Breitbart News. Everyone has certain rights... If they need a legal defense, and people donate to it, and all the moneys legal, then I dont see an issue with it. People have a right to donate to controversial causes.

MakerSupport, another alternative to Patreon that promised to allow creators to raise funds regardless of their political affiliations, has effectively been destroyed after Stripe withdrew service from the platform. MakerSupport revealed their difficulties with Stripe back in April, before going silent. People who donated to creators through the site were left wondering where their money had gone.

Thats the brutal reality of payment processor censorship. Once a service like Stripe decides to withdraw support for a platform, thousands of dollars  peoples donations, income streams, and livelihoods  can be left in limbo.

Can a conservative competitor to Stripe or PayPal be created? Almost certainly not. The regulatory hurdles of setting up a payments processor, the difficulty of forging relationships with major banks, and the complexity of the technology and scarcity of talented programmers with experience in the field mean the operating and start-up costs are high. A payments processor targeted at the niche market of former Patreon users who have since been banned from the platform will not turn a profit. Anyone willing to set one up would have to be willing to burn a lot of money. Much like competing with Google or Apple, its easier said than done.

Moreover, a PayPal or Stripe competitor would still be dependent on business relationships with banks and credit card providers, none of which have any incentive to be first amendment friendly. MasterCard proved that back in 2011 when they joined a financial services boycott against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. In order to fully guarantee a politically neutral service, you would need more than your own version of PayPal: youd need your own bank and your own credit card business.

The existing banks cant be relied on, thats for sure  even mainstream conservative causes are too controversial for them these days. Citi, the fourth-largest bank in America, announced in March that it would withdraw its services from weapons and ammunition stores that refuse to accept a range of progressive gun control demands, none of which are mandated by U.S. law. These included prohibitions on the sale of bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. A week later, an investing group claiming to represent over $600 billion in assets urged its members to cut ties with the NRA.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was recently refused service at a restaurant because of her position in the Trump administration. Now imagine being refused a bank account because you wont comply with progressives gun control demands.

But its not just conservatives who are concerned by the power of payment processors and financial institutions to shut down political expression. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a liberal organization known for promoting left-wing causes like the Obama administrations net neutrality regulations, has expressed grave misgivings at the decision of financial institutions to withdraw services for political reasons.

In detailed comments provided to Breitbart News (read them in full here), the liberal group said payment processors like PayPal have become de facto internet censors.

EFF is deeply concerned that payment processors are making choices about which websites can and cant accept payments or process donations, an EFF spokeswoman told Breitbart News. This can have a huge impact  on what types of speech are allowed to flourish online.

In online fundraising as in social media, the internet provides a tremendous advantage to those who know how to use it. When allowed, conservatives and critics of progressivism have used these platforms to great effect. The dissident Canadian academic Jordan Peterson is supported by over 9,500 small donors on Patreon. Memories Pizza, the Indiana-based pizza parlor forced to close its doors after it was publicly attacked by the establishment media for refusing to cater gay weddings, was able to reopen after its supporters raised over $800,000 via GoFundMe.

As the left prepares for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 general election, they want to ensure that only they have access to that tremendous power. And with PayPal and Stripe withdrawing support from politically neutral fundraising platforms, they are well on their way to achieving that aim. Like the social media purges, this represents an existential threat to the conservative and pro-Trump movement.

2018-07-02,Breitbart,Sen Collins Supreme Court Pick Who Would Overrule Roe v Wade Is Unacceptable,"Every senators vote will count in confirming the eventual nominee because with Sen. John McCain not voting in the Senate due to his serious cancer, Republicans hold the barest of margins in what is now consequently a 50-49 Senate.

In a full-length Sunday morning interview, Martha Raddatz asked Collins about a White House meeting she and four other moderate senators had with the president regarding his selecting a replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy. In addition to Collins, the group of two Republicans and three Democrats included Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Joe Donnelly (D-IN).

While not discussing many details of her private conversation with the president, Collins told Raddatz she suggested that he broaden his search beyond the list of 25 nominees, referring to the presidents List of 25 from which he has pledged to pick the new justice.

Collins discussed what she was looking for in a new justice, listing various attributes, then adding, Most importantly of all, respect for precedent.

That was a reference to Roe, where the Court in 1973 invented a constitutional right to abortion.

A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable, said Collins, because I believe that they have demonstrated a disrespect for the vital principle of stare decisis.

Stare decisis is a Latin term referring to adhering to precedent. Once a court has decided an issue, stare decisis is the policy that the same court should abide by that precedent in future cases unless there is an extraordinary justification for overruling it.

Collins quoted Chief Justice John Roberts, who called stare decisis a fundamental principle of our judicial system.

Roberts also referred to Roe as settled law, which she took as a sign that he might not overrule Roe if given the chance.

The president listened very intently to what Lisa Murkowski and I said, Collins continued, saying she regarded his meeting with them as genuine outreach regarding the Supreme Court.

The Maine Republican added that it would be inappropriate to ask a judicial nominee how they are going to vote on a future case, including one challenging Roe.

Collins also said that good judges are always unhappy with some of their decisions but they make the right call regardless of their personal views. And thats what I want to see in this nominee.

For several reasons, Collins should be comfortable with President Trumps process and his eventual choice.

First, most of the people on the List of 25 do not have a record of stating that they would overrule Roe. Most of them similarly have a record of speaking of the importance of precedent. That combination would seem to satisfy Collins requirements.

Second, there is a good chance that the fate of Roe does not turn on this Supreme Court pick even if that nominee would vote to overturn the 1973 precedent. Of the current members of the Supreme Court, only one justice has said he would overrule Roe: Justice Clarence Thomas.

Roe has not been squarely challenged in recent years, so there has been no occasion for Chief Justice Roberts or Justices Alito or Gorsuch to vote on Roe one way or the other.

Many experts question whether Roberts, in particular, would be willing to go that far, given comments such as the one Collins cited, where he extolled the importance of stare decisis and also said that Roe was settled law. He places greater value and weight on stare decisis than any other member of the Court, only rarely voting to jettison precedent.

These experts consider it likely that Roberts will allow significant restrictions on abortion while retaining Roe. There may be other justices who share that view, and if so, Collins and Murkowski could support the presidents nominee in any event.

Moreover, the chief justice breaks with conservatives a fair amount of the time and has repeatedly shown that he does not regard originalism  interpreting the Constitution according to the original public meaning of its words  as the only acceptable way to interpret the Constitution.

President Trump must walk a fine line in selecting a Supreme Court justice as he pursues a route that will result in confirmation in the narrowly divided Senate ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, and Collins seems to enjoy the leverage her critical role in that process brings.

2018-06-16,Breitbart,China Conducts Military Exercises with Drones in South China Sea,"The announcement came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Chinese officials in Beijing that Washington is very concerned regarding Chinas illegal moves in the region.

The South China Morning Post quotes Chinas PLA Daily as describing a drill meant to respond to an attack on its navy in the air and involving three target drones making flyovers of a ship formation at varying heights and directions. The drones served to precisely verify the feasibility and effectiveness to ensure a close stimulation of an aerial attack target, according to the report.

These latest exercises follow a month of changes in the South China Sea. The PLA recently removed some missiles from Woody Island, an island in Vietnams Paracel Island chain that China has colonized. The missiles disappeared following the United States flying B-52 bombers through the region. Less than a week later, however, satellite images show that Chinese officials had placed the missiles back in their position, leading some to believe that they had been moved merely for routine maintenance.

At the time, the Chinese Foreign ministry angrily denounced the United States for flying bombers in the region.

Isnt it militarization when you send attacking weapons like the B-52 bombers to the South China Sea? Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a briefing last week. If someone frequently flexes his muscles or snoops around near your house, shouldnt you raise your alertness and improve your defense capabilities?

China claims territory disputed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan in the South China Sea. The maritime territory China claims as domestic Chinese waters falls under what Beijing calls the nine-dash line, which encompasses most of the sea. The Chinese report did not specify where in the vast sea the exercises took place, so it remains unclear whether Beijing used the sovereign territory of a foreign nation to test its latest naval technology.

The United States has repeatedly challenged Chinas claims in the region. The Philippines took China to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, which ruled in 2016 that Chinas claims were illegal. China continued to build artificial islands and equip them with military assets, anyway, fully disregarding the ruling. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has said that he fears a confrontation with China would lead to unnecessary bloodshed for the Philippines in the past, but this year warned he was ready to go to war over the region.

The United States has challenged China in the region by executing Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) through the territory China claims. U.S. Navy assets have passed through there without incident to enforce the law and prevent China from making a claim that no other country uses the international waters for transport.

On Thursday, Pompeo, making his first trip to China, told Foreign Minister Wang Yi that Washington would like to see an end to Chinas illegal claims and militarization.

I reaffirmed our concern with respect to Chinas efforts to build a militarized outpost in the South China Sea, endangering the free flow of trade and threatening the sovereignty of other nations and undermining regional stability, Pompeo told reporters. I urged Councilor Wang and he confirmed Chinas willingness to resolve these disputes in a peaceful way without resort to threats, coercion, or intimidation. I am confident that we can continue to work together towards that end."
2018-06-15,Breitbart,Brexit May Un-Surrenders to Tory Remainers Faces Parliamentary Rebellion,"Mrs May was previously reported to have made a series of concessions to Tory rebels loyal to the European Union, agreeing to allow the Remainer-dominated Parliament to have a so-called meaningful vote on the terms of Britains exit from the EU  which Leave supporters decried as an effective veto on Brexit.

Brexit supporters on the 1922 Committee  made up of Tory MPs who do not hold Government positions  were swift to react once the implications of these concessions became clear, with one senior Leaver remarking: If Theresa and [Chief Whip Julian Smith] have sold us out here they are in real trouble. She reassured us all at the 1922. There is no way she can recover if she has now f*cked us over.

Consequently, the Government has now changed its proposed amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill again, so that, should MPs vote down a UK-EU Brexit deal, Theresa May announce before January 21st 2019 that no deal has been reached, or January 21st pass with no deal being struck, a Government minister will give a statement to Parliament which can be put to a vote on neutral terms  but with no opportunity to reject a No Deal exit and keep Britain in the EU.

Dominic Grieve, the former attorney-general and who leads the contingent of Tory diehards loyal to the EU, has said this new version of the amendment is unacceptable and that it takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote he was demanding.

Grieve said on BBC Question Time: The difficulty and the anxiety is that we end up with a deal which is rejected by Parliament because it doesnt think it is good enough.

There has been a suggestion that in those circumstances it is a binary choice and you have to leave with no deal.

That must be wrong and Parliament in those circumstances will have to take action to try to remedy it without causing too great a political crisis  it will certainly be quite a big political crisis, he insisted.

The issue with Grieves position identified by Brexiteers is that it effectively allows Remainer MPs to reject any deal the Prime Minister produces as not good enough and to reject the alternative of No Deal as well  effectively cancelling Brexit.

This gives the EU very little incentive to negotiate constructively with Britain, knowing that it can stop Brexit by offering a terrible deal, safe in the knowledge that MPs will not accept it or the alternative of a No Deal exit.

The British public voted to Leave the European Union almost two years ago in June 2016, in a referendum which MPs authorised and the Government promised to honour.

MPs from the governing Tory Party, its DUP partners, and the Labour Party opposition all stood on manifestos which promised to deliver Brexit in the subsequent 2017 snap election."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Rand Paul on John Bolton I Hope He Was at the Childrens Table During Trump-Kim Summit,"Tuesday on Fox News Channels Your World, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) pushed back against some of the so-called neo-con reacting to and involved with President Donald Trump summit in Singapore earlier this week with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

Paul took exception to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who insisted the United States maintain a military presence on the Korean peninsula, and to Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton, who he said he hoped was relegated to the childrens table during the discussions.

CAVUTO: I will belabor this issue one more time, if you will indulge me, because I wanted to have Lindsey Graham on. But he constantly refuses coming on this show. Thats fine.

But the one thing that I did want to get from you is your take on his two extreme views of what can happen here. Either there is peace, or there is war. There is no middle ground. What do you make of that?

PAUL: Well, think thats atypical of the neoconservatives. They see black and white. They think youre either Chamberlain or youre Churchill.

Theres no in between, and theres no nuance to diplomacy, when, in reality, theres a great deal of nuance. And so we have to figure out a way forward to get to denuclearization.

But, for example, John Bolton, another Lindsey Graham neocon, for him to say, oh, were going to show on the Libyan solution, which was I guess you give up your nuclear weapons, then we kill you, is probably not good for diplomacy either.

So we have to  diplomats should think about what they say before they say them. And we need to be talking about how we can denuclearize North Korea and the whole entire Korean Peninsula. And that involves give and take.

And this is what the neocons will never understand. They think its either going to be Hiroshima and unconditional surrender, or thats what it is. Its either all or nothing

And really most of diplomacy is not about unconditional surrender. Its really about trying to figure out what can we give the North Koreans. So I think giving up the war games, which happens twice a year, is a perfectly appropriate thing to do, as President Trump said, as long as there is progress.

It can easily be started again. But thats a great first step. And North Koreas has offered to do no more testing.

Now, thats not denuclearization, but those are two good initial steps. The neocons would never offer any offer carrot, because theyre all about the stick. And they want everybody to just kneel down and behave.

CAVUTO: But one of those neocons, Senator, is at the table. John Bolton was the table. Im sure the president had that by design. Of course, Mike Pompeo was there as well, and others were there.

But why do you think he did that? Because, of course, the North Koreans were apoplectic over his Libya comments, as you alluded to. And yet there he was. What do you make of it?

PAUL: My hope is that he was at the childrens table and that he wasnt influencing the discussion among adults.

CAVUTO: Hmm. I think he was at the main table.

But lets step back from this. And you talk about what the North Koreans might offer down the road as far as more tests and all the rest, and what we are offering to do to stop the joint exercises for the time being.

We could start those back up if were not getting signs of progress out of the North Koreans.

But a lot of people have looked at this and said, well, we must have that guarantee, that we must have verifiable proof that the North Koreans are denuclearizing, are starting to dismantle things.

And that does not appear  I stress appear  to be in this agreement.

PAUL: Right. Its not. I mean, so that will come over time.

They have been duplicitous in the past.

CAVUTO: So should we have volunteered, Senator  Im sorry sir, but I just want to clear.

Should we have volunteered to go ahead and stop these exercises?

PAUL: Yes, because that can easily be restarted at any point in time. But it shows good will. Its nothing permanent.

Its not like giving them money. And Im not forgiving the North Koreans any money. I would offer them the allure of trade with Japan and South Korea and us, and expanded trade with China, and the allure of what trade and commerce brings basically to a country.

He has to know. Hes traveled the world. His people may not have ever seen the great opulence that there is in South Korea, but he and his leaders know that there is. And they know that theres starvation in their country.

We offer them the allure of becoming part of the world of nations. But there have  will have to be verifiable tests. And I think that the relinquishment of sanctions, even possibly bringing troops home, are all things that should be dangled out there.

And if any of them are to happen, we have to verifiable nuclear  denuclearization. And it would probably be a ratcheting down of things over a period of time as he shows compliance."
2018-07-27,Breitbart,Donald Trump Denies Michael Cohen Claim He Knew About Donald Trump Jr Meeting,"So the Fake News doesnt waste my time with dumb questions, NO. I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don Jr., Trump wrote on Twitter.

Trump accused Cohen of trying to make up stories to help him escape criminal charges after his home and office were raided by federal law enforcement authorities.

Sources with knowledge, told CNN on Thursday that Cohen claimed that President Trump knew about the Donald Trump Jr. meeting and said Cohen was present when Trump was told about it.

Cohen has retained former Clinton lawyer Lanny Davis in his defense, although the sources with knowledge acknowledged that Cohen has no evidence to prove his claim.

Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?), Trump wrote on Twitter. He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillarys lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!

Trump again criticized the Mueller investigation as a waste of time and money, after the New York Times reported that investigators were examining the presidents messages on Twitter for possibly obstructing justice.

Now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people)  the rigged Witch Hunt continues! Trump wrote. How stupid and unfair to our Country."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,Senate Report Obamacare and Medicaid Expansion Contributed to the Opioid Epidemic,"The case laid out by the report is straightforward, logical, and politically unspeakable. Its an argument generally made in hushed tones until now, and its easy to see why. Even the Senate Homeland Security report was swiftly denounced as a partisan fantasy peddled by chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) in what little mainstream media coverage it received. Thou shalt not speak ill of Medicaid.

And yet, the critics could find no way to refute the actual data in the report. They denounced it with thunderous virtue-signaling outrage, attacked those involved in preparing it, criticized arguments it did not make  such as pretending the report claims the opioid epidemic was caused by Medicaid expansion, rather than exacerbated by it  or simply assumed that all critiques of Medicaid and Obamacare must be partisan hit jobs, Q.E.D.

This validates one of the core concerns about politicizing medicine, or any other scientific field, by putting Big Government in charge of it. Rational discussion becomes impossible. Every analysis quickly devolves into a partisan brawl.

The report postulates Medicaid expansion is a contributing factor to the epidemic of opioid abuse  not the sole or original cause, as the report itself and Sen. Johnson took pains to point out, despite mischaracterizations by critics. Much of the opioid crisis involves prescription drugs, which can become addictive even when legitimately prescribed, and are often stolen through fraud and resold on the street. Medicaid expansion greatly increased access to prescription drugs. Medicaid also includes programs to fight drug abuse, but some of those programs involve pharmaceutical treatments that can themselves become addictive, especially when they fall into the hands of street pushers.

It requires no great leap of logic to see the connection between a dramatic increase in access to drugs and a problem driven by easy access to drugs, and yet it is evidently heretical to state that relationship out loud. Thats even more remarkable when the increased use and abuse of painkillers is universally acknowledged as a major element of the opioid crisis.

No one seems to have trouble acknowledging that fact when blaming pharmaceutical companies for creating and pushing drugs, doctors for over-prescribing them, or Americans for reporting remarkably high levels of pain and demanding truckloads of pills to deal with it. The Senate report itself states at the very beginning that the opioid epidemic is complicated, and most agree that development, marketing, and medical training regarding drug usage  and the resulting over-prescription of opioids  have played a key role.

Ask if a massive government program that makes it much easier for over one-fifth of the population to get drugs could be part of the problem, however, and youre a hyper-partisan monster who really just wants to kill poor people by taking away their Obamacare. The Senate committee demonstrated its understanding of just how hot this political potato is by filling the early pages of the report with lavish praise for Medicaid and its good intentions, and repeatedly stating that government spending on drugs is but one factor in a complex crisis that deserves careful analysis.

The report studied hundreds of cases in which Medicaid was abused and defrauded to obtain opioids that were often resold on the streets. The report quotes Sam Quinones award-winning book Dreamland: The True Tale of Americas Opiate Epidemic to explain why this outcome was entirely predictable: We can talk morality all day long, but if youre drawing five hundred dollars a month and you have a Medicaid card that allows you to get a monthly supply of pills worth several thousand dollars, youre going to sell your pills.

Some of the fraud cases detailed in the report go far beyond individual beneficiaries making the sort of calculation Quinones described. Some of them were organized conspiracies involving large numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries recruited to provide inventory to drug dealers. The largest scheme chronicled in the report saw over a billion dollars change hands.

A police officer quoted in the report observed that pharmacists are more likely to fill dubious prescriptions when Medicaid is involved. The Justice Department launched a program over the summer to study the role played real and fraudulent prescriptions for opioids in the drug crisis.

The Senate Homeland Security report further notes that Medicaid fraud is rampant and has not been handled effectively by the government, a fact known to any serious student of the waste, fraud, and abuse that politicians of both parties vow to crack down upon during every election.

Other fraud-susceptible programs such as Medicare, the VA, and the food stamp program are duly cited by the report as sources of opioids.

The research suggests, however, that Medicaid is the federal program most prone to abuse, and the primary government funding source for the epidemic, the authors point out.

There appears to be no limit to the types of schemes used to scam the Medicaid program, from large drug rings that employ beneficiaries as runners to fill oxycodone prescriptions, to nurses working the night shift who steal hydrocodone pills from patients. Illicit painkillers obtained with Medicaid cards are being resold at handsome profits nationwide, in places ranging from the streets of Milwaukee to a Native American reservation in upstate New York, says the report.

Another problem is the illicit use of drugs intended to treat drug addiction, notably suboxone. The attorney general of Kentucky is quoted declaring that wrongful prescribing of suboxone is flooding our communities with yet another drug that is killing our children.

Its not just illicit street purchases increasing in tandem with Medicaid expansion. National Review points to Centers for Disease Control data that opioid prescribing rates among Medicaid enrollees are at least twofold higher than rates for persons with private insurance. In Washington State, the CDC found that Medicaid beneficiaries were 5.7 times more likely to die of opioid-related causes.

The most provocative section of the report introduces facts and figures to buttress the argument that opioid abuse has grown worse in states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.

More than 80 percent of the 298 separate Medicaid-opioids cases identified were filed in Medicaid expansion states, led by New York, Michigan, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Ohio, the report states. The number of criminal cases increased 55 percent in the first four years after the Medicaid expansion, from 2014 to 2017, compared to the four-year period before expansion.

It is further noted that drug overdose deaths are increasing almost twice as fast in expansion states, hospital stays for opioid-related issues massively spiked after expansion, and Medicaid spending for drug abuse treatment is rising faster in expansion states.

Conversely, as Investors Business Daily notes, eight of the 15 states with the lowest overdose rates did not expand Medicaid. All of these observations should be considered with the usual caveat that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation  there are almost certainly other factors common to expansion states that help to explain their rising addiction rates, although the dramatic increase immediately after the expansion is not easily dismissed.

These assertions are based on official figures that most analysts agree are significantly under-stating the depths of the opioid crisis. One specialist quoted in the Senate report said the opioid epidemic is deadlier than the AIDS epidemic at its peak.

Reviewing the Senate Homeland Security report for Forbes, Sally Pipes notes that state Medicaid expansion had the perverse effect of enrolling able-bodied, childless adults in their Medicaid programs than it does for children and the destitute elderly. Able-bodied childless adults are also the group experiencing an anomalous increase in mortality rates, which in turn is believed to be strongly influenced by opioid addiction.

About 80 percent of heroin and fentanyl users spiraled into their addictions after first getting hooked on prescription painkillers. The Medicaid expansion made those painkillers widely and cheaply available, Pipes notes, succinctly stating the point nobody is supposed to make.

She also tackles the bizarre argument that Medicaid is a net plus because it treats more drug addicts than it creates, which is the sort of argument that only makes sense to people whose capacity for reason has been eroded by decades of worshipping Big Government. (Try this argument for comparison purposes: Tobacco companies are a net plus for public health because they provide so much funding to treat smoking-related illnesses.)

Pipes suggests addressing the crisis by rolling back the Medicaid expansion and block-granting funds to states, which could help to drain the bureaucratic swamp that hides so much Medicaid corruption and strongly incentivize states to watch their health-care dollars more carefully.

Such suggestions run strongly against the current political tides, with Democrats pushing hard for even more centralized political control of medicine and ever-larger bureaucracies, with an eye toward midwifing the birth of the doomsday bureaucratic monstrosity known as single-payer socialized medicine. Imagine how bad the opioid crisis will get if everyone gets Medicaid.

But of course, youre not supposed to imagine that, much less conduct hard research into any aspect of the absolutely forbidden notion that government makes problems worse by subsidizing them."
2018-07-13,Breitbart,Microsoft Threatens Trump on Middle-Class Visa Outsourcing,"We dont want to move jobs out of the United States and we hope that we dont see decision making in Washington that would force us to do that, said Brad Smith, the companys president and chief legal officer told CNBC on July 12.

The company and its subcontractors already employ thousands of foreign college-grads via the H-1B, Optional Practical Training, and Employment Authorization Document temporary visa-worker programs.

These visa-outsourcing programs already keep a shifting population of at least 1.5 million foreign college graduates in U.S. jobs.

The issue is heating up because President Donald Trumps Hire American policy has prompted agency officials to begin canceling a visa-worker program invented by officials working for former President Barack Obama. Under the so-called H4 EAD program, officials have granted work permits to roughly 100,000 spouses of foreign visa-workers, even though Congress bars the employment of foreign workers.

The similar OPT program was also created without approval from Congress, reportedly at the request of Microsoft, supposedly as a work-training program for foreign students at U.S. universities. But the program now provides companies with roughly 250,000 foreign graduates to take jobs sought by American youths. This year, Trumps deputies set new rules to help reduce the use of OPT trainees in white-collar jobs sought by U.S. graduates.

Smith said Microsoft would fund lawsuits to keep the 350,000 OPT and H4 EAD foreign workers in the jobs sought by debt-burdened U.S. graduates.  Were not going to cut people loose, he told CNBC. Were going to stand behind them, he added.

Salaries for U.S. college graduates have stalled amid the flood of foreign college-graduates temporary workers into prestigious U.S. jobs in universities, healthcare, research, software, business, and engineering. Many of the foreign workers take jobs at low salaries and long hours in the hope of eventually winning the deferred bonus of U.S. citizenship.

However, Microsofts stock has risen from $65 a share to $105 a share since Trumps inauguration, according to a Yahoo stock chart. That increase has provided roughly $00 billion in extra value to the stockholders.

These middle-class outsourcing programs are rarely mentioned in establishment media outlets, which instead focus on the concerns of migrants, including the Central American migrants who bring their children to trigger catch-and-release laws. The Smith interview was conducted by a reporter from Singapore.

To build support among Americans for hiring foreign graduates instead of American graduates, Smith said he would support a program to push Microsofts products and services into lower-density rural areas:

I think we have to show that on the one hand we will stand up for issues like immigration where we feel our interests are at stake, Smith said. But we also have to show that we get it, that we understand what these other parts of the country need and we need to take tangible steps ourselves as were striving to do, to meet those needs.

They live in these broadband deserts, Smith said about Americans.

2018-06-18,Breitbart,PHOTOS Obama Used Same So-Called Cages to Detain Child Border Crossers,"A series of rare photos taken from inside detention facilities where mostly Central American minors were held in detention under the Obama administration in 2014 reveals that detention of border crossers has largely remained the same under Trump as it was under the previous administration.

For weeks, the establishment media has referred to the detention facilities where federal immigration officials are holding child border crossers as cages and one Senate Democrat even called the facilities dog kennels.

CBS News, Time Magazine, Business Insider, NBC News, and their counterparts in the Democratic Party have continuously claimed migrant children are being held in cages, specifically pointing to photos from a detention facility in McAllen, Texas. These same barriers, though, were used in that McAllen detention facility under President Obama when the establishment media was silent on the issue.

These images from 2014 reveal how the Obama administration used the same so-called cages to detain child border crossers:

In 2014, Breitbart Texas broke the story of how child border crossers were being crammed into detention centers and facilities by the Obama administration, revealing a number of exclusive photos that went unmentioned by the establishment media.

The policy to prosecute all illegal border crossers, including illegal alien adults who cross the border with children, results in border-crossing parents having their children taken into federal custody. This is a loophole known as the Flores Settlement Agreement.

Detaining child border crossers was a policy during the Obama administration, where Breitbart Texas exclusively reported on the conditions in which unaccompanied minors were being packed into crowded cells and holding facilities.

President Trump has asked the Republican-controlled Congress and Democrat lawmakers to close the loophole so that minors can be swiftly deported from the U.S. with their border-crossing parents. But lawmakers have failed to end the settlement agreement.

Most recently, Breitbart News exclusively revealed the comfortable living conditions that unaccompanied minor border crossers are placed into by the Department of Health and Human Services.

These unaccompanied minor border crossers have a higher standard of living when in federal custody than the more than 13 million American children who are living in poverty in the U.S., Breitbart News noted."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Caroline Glick Unlike Netanyahu Trudeau Expects America to Do All the Hard Work,"The comparison, in and of itself, is ridiculous.

Kim is the leader of a longtime U.S. enemy. Just last summer, fear of war with North Korea surged as Little Rocket Man tested intercontinental ballistic missiles presumably capable of reaching the U.S. As Vanity Fairs T.A. Franks noted, flattering mass murdering enemy leaders is something U.S. leaders have often felt compelled to do to advance U.S. interests.

Comparing the way Trump treats the two men, then, is just as pointless as comparing apples and oranges.

A much more apt, and enlightening, analysis would be to consider Trumps disparate treatment of two allies  for instance, Trudeau and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Both Trudeau and Netanyahu lead U.S. allies. But whereas Trump and his advisors sharply rebuked Trudeau for his angry assault following the G-7 summit last week, Netanyahu and Trump enjoy close, intense, and mutually supportive ties. Far from attacking one another, Trump and Netanyahu consistently back one another up in their public statements.

What accounts for the disparity? More broadly, what does the disparity in treatment tell us about Trumps expectations from foreign leaders? What does it teach us about his foreign policy outlook more generally?

Earlier this week, the New Yorker published a 5,000-word article by Adam Entous chronicling, among other things, the way that Netanyahu and Trump forged their close relationship. In Donald Trumps New World Order: How the President, Israel and the Gulf States plan to fight Iran  and leave the Palestinians and the Obama years behind, Entous details the deterioration of relations between Netanyahu and Barack Obama over his eight years in office.

While Entous ignores the extraordinary lengths to which Netanyahu went between 2009 and 2014 to develop a cooperative relationship with Obama, (see here, here, here, here, here, here, for instance), he discusses in vast detail the steps Netanyahu adopted to mitigate the damage Obamas policies in relation to Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood caused Israel.

Finally, Entous turns his attention to how Netanyahu and Trumps relationship was built, and why it is so strong.

Entous notes that by 2015, Netanyahu had given up on trying to appease Obama, for two reasons.

First, in early 2014, Obama concluded an interim nuclear deal with Iran that did not require Iran to cease all uranium enrichment activities. When its details were revealed, Israel realized Obama had no intention of preventing Iran from developing nuclear technologies that would enable it to develop a nuclear arsenal.

Second, in the summer of 2014, Hamas, the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, kidnapped and murdered three Israeli teenagers. In its follow-up to the massacre, Hamas launched a massive missile and rocket war against Israel.

Israel referred to the war that ensued as Operation Protective Edge. Qatar and Turkey served as Hamass diplomatic representatives and defenders.

Rather than side with Israel in its war against the Hamas terror regime, as all of his predecessors had done to varying degrees, Obama sided with Hamas and its state sponsors, Qatar and Turkey, against Israel.

Obama insisted that Netanyahu accept Hamass ceasefire conditions and walk away with no guarantee that Hamas would end its rocket and missile offensive against Israel.

Obamas embrace of Iran and effective alliance with Hamas through Turkey and Qatar were the last straws for Israel.

But Obamas behavior had not come as a surprise. Sensing, earlier on, where the wind was blowing, Netanyahu had already been working to sidestep Obama by developing an alliance with Americas other spurned Middle Eastern allies: Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. Like Israel, these three regimes were mortally threatened by Iran. Like Israel   indeed, to an even greater degree than Israel  these regimes viewed the Muslim Brotherhood and its allies and offshoots, including Hamas, as existential threats.

Entous provides a fairly detailed description of Israels diplomatic moves in regard to the UAE. As he notes, the center of gravity of the operational alliance between Israel and the Sunnis was their joint effort to undermine Irans nuclear program and blunt the impact of Obamas efforts to appease Iran. But their joint operations were also directed against the Muslim Brotherhood, its branches, and their state sponsors, including Turkey and Qatar.

As a consequence, the first time the Israeli-Sunni alliance came to public attention was during Operation Protective Edge.

As Obama insisted Israel accept the Turkish-Qatari ceasefire offer  that is, Hamass ceasefire conditions  Egypt, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia all sided with Israel against Hamas  and Obama. They rejected Hamass ceasefire conditions and embraced Israels positions entirely. Their stunning public support for Israel compelled Obama to walk back his pressure on Israel.

As for Iran, the Israel-Sunni operational alliance was important for two reasons. First, it empowered Netanyahu to defy openly Obama on the Iran nuclear deal. That defiance was expressed most powerfully when Netanyahu detailed the problems with the nuclear deal in an address to a special joint session of Congress in March 2015. Second, the operational ties between Israel and the Sunni Gulf states facilitated Mossad and other operations against Iranian plans and capabilities.

As Entous notes, in Netanyahus first meeting with Trump, which took place in September 2016 at the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York, Netanyahu and Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer presented then-candidate Trump with Netanyahus vision of a new U.S. regional posture in the Middle East. Such a U.S. posture could be based on the U.S. leading the operational alliance that Netanyahu had developed with the Sunnis.

Entous writes that Trumps campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, was blown away by their presentation. A former Trump advisor told Entous that the two Israelis had thought this through  this wasnt half-baked. This was well articulated and it dovetailed exactly with our thinking.

According to Entous, the advisor credited Netanyahu and Dermer with inspiring the new administrations approach to the Middle East.

In his first trip as president, Trump did, in fact, take the lead in the alliance Netanyahu formed. Recognizing that American interests were better served by confronting Iran and Hamas than by strengthening them, Trump flew first to Saudi Arabia, and then continued on directly to Israel. Trump embraced and built upon the foundations Netanyahu had developed in order to advance Trumps own vision of American needs in the Middle East. In particular, Trump charged U.S. allies with taking serious steps to advance the common goal of constraining and defeating Iran and Sunni jihadists.

Trumps close relationship with Netanyahu owes, then, to two things. First, by developing Israels ties with the Sunni Arab states, Netanyahu demonstrated that he is capable of acting to defend Israel and shared U.S.-Israeli interests, even without U.S. assistance. That showed Trump that Israel is an ally, not a protectorate of the U.S.  and that Netanyahu is a partner, not a burden, for the U.S. in the post-Obama Middle East.

Second, by presenting Trump with a fully thought-out strategy for rebuilding U.S. leadership in the Arab world in the aftermath of Obamas embrace of Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood, based on the ties Israel had already developed with the Sunnis, Netanyahu gave Trump a relatively low-cost option for replacing Obamas policies with ones that better suited Trumps understanding of American needs and interests.

Since that initial meeting, Netanyahu and Trump have continued to expand their ties, and their support for one anothers efforts to achieve common strategic goals.

This then brings us to Trudeau.

During the 2016 campaign, although Trump made abandoning Obamas Iran nuclear deal and moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem key foreign policy goals, updating international trade deals was a much more significant campaign issue. And one of Trumps central pledges to his voters was his vow to improve, or walk away from, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which President Bill Clinton had signed with Canada and Mexico.

Whereas Netanyahu  out of concern for both developing strategic ties with the incoming Trump administration and for mitigating the damage Obamas policies had wrought on Israels national security  presented Trump with clearly articulated plans for achieving Trumps own goals, Trudeau chose to ignore trade, despite a certain looming showdown over the issue with the Trump administration.

In other words: rather than accept that once Trump was elected, the Canadians would need to accept a new trade relationship with the Americans, Trudeau adopted positions on NAFTA that made it impossible to reach a deal.

For the past six months, Trudeau has managed to alienate U.S. trade representative Ambassador Robert Lighthizer. Canadian representatives have refused to consider, let alone respect, reasonable U.S. concerns about trade tariffs, automobile manufacturing, and other key aspects of NAFTA and bilateral trade.

Instead of seeking compromises that could advance the interests of both countries, or at a minimum limit the damage that new U.S. trade policies would cause the Canadian economy, Trudeau pretended away the issue  hoping, apparently, that Trump would disappear if Trudeau just ignored him.

Consequently, rather than engaging seriously with American negotiators  as the Mexicans are  Trudeau has added insult to injury by slapping progressive social engineering provisions regarding indigenous, gender, and worker rights onto Canadas trade policies. Trudeau is apparently attempting to use bilateral trade to dictate the Trump administrations social policy.

In other words, Trudeau has embraced posturing over substantive policymaking. Rather than presenting Trump with a deal that could make sense for the U.S. and Canada, Trudeau has presented himself as a progressive hero, standing up to the Lefts greatest enemy.

Given Trudeaus behavior, it was just a matter of time before trade talks between Washington and Ottowa blew up. Canadas leader offered Trump no alternative to confrontation.

The disparity between Trumps treatment of Israel and Canada tells us two important things.

First, when Trump criticizes American allies for expecting the United States to defend them and pay for the privilege, he isnt doing it to blow off steam. Trump believes that for alliances to be meaningful, they have to be alliances between independent states that come together to pursue common interests.

True, the U.S. is the strongest party. But it cannot be expected to do what its allies could do themselves yet refuse to do. When Trump discusses NATO reform, there can be little doubt that he envisions an alliance of states that actually defend themselves.

Second, Trumps disparate treatment of Netanyahu and Trudeau shows that the conventional, contemptuous view of Trumps foreign policy is wrong.

This week, the Atlantic dismissed the Trump Doctrine as Were America, Bitch! (albeit quoting an administration official).

Trumps actual doctrine is that the U.S. will help its allies and foes when they pursue goals the U.S. shares. And the U.S. will spurn allies  and enemies  who expect America to do their bidding as they mistake posturing for policymaking, and attitude for work."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Report Michael Cohen Will Likely Cooperate with Prosecutors After Losing Lawyers,"As attorneys for Michael Cohen rush to meet Judge Kimba Woods Friday deadline to complete a privilege review of over 3.7 million documents seized in the April 9 raids of Cohens New York properties and law office, a source representing this matter has disclosed to ABC News that the law firm handling the case for Cohen is not expected to represent him going forward, ABC News reports.

Todd Harrison and Stephen Ryan of McDermott, Will & Emery LLP attorneys represented Cohen until now.

Cohen is reportedly telling associates he expects to be arrested any day now. When reached for comment by Vanity Fair, the lawyer replied, Your alleged source is wrong!

Cohen  whose office, home, and hotel in New York were raided by FBI agents in April  is under investigation for wire fraud, bank fraud, and campaign finance violations.

Ryan previously blasted the raids in a statement, calling them completely inappropriate and unnecessary.

It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney-client communications between a lawyer and his clients. These government tactics are also wrong because Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath, Ryan added.

They continue to just go forward, and here we are talking about Syria... and I have this witch hunt constantly going on, for over 12 months now, and actually much more than that. You could say it was right after I won the nomination, it started. And its a disgrace. Its frankly, a real disgrace. Its an attack on our country in a true sense. Its an attack on what we all stand for, Trump told reporters following a meeting with Cabinet members."
2018-02-12,Breitbart,US Military Introduces Acupuncture Pain Relief for Soldiers to Fight Opioid Abuse,"The practice, which first originated in China about 8,000 years ago, provides immediate relief for acute and chronic pain, and, without the risk of addiction, can be used without any restrictions, reported the Military Times. One of the most popular forms used in the military has been dubbed battlefield acupuncture, or BFA, because its simple to administer and easily transportable, according to Dr. Richard Niemtzow, who developed BFA in 2001. With BFA, service members can continue to participate, unimpaired, in work and life.

The Military Times also added that, Service members who use BFA can still fly aircraft, unlike those who use opiates.

They dont have to wait hours for medications to take maximal effect or endure side effects, like drowsiness or allergic reactions, of common pain medications, declared Air Force Col. Lynda Vu. This allows personnel to go back to the fight with minimal impact to continuing mission operations.

This requires either training prior to deployment or having a trained instructor administer the provider BFA course in the deployed location, she continued.

The Department of Justice in December created the role of Opioid Tsar to combat the opioid epidemic, which has resulted in overdose deaths overtaking breast cancer deaths in America."
2018-08-30,Breitbart,Mexican National Drops Demand He Not Be Called Illegal Alien in Mollie Tibbetts Murder Trial,"Last week, Breitbart News reported how 24-year-old illegal alien Cristhian Bahena-Rivera of Mexico demanded that he not be referred to as an illegal alien in an order from his then-attorney, Allan Richards.

Bahena-Rivera has been charged with first-degree murder in her death after police say he admitted to confronting and chasing down Tibbetts. The illegal alien lived in a region of Iowa that was surrounded by sanctuary cities, as Breitbart News noted, and worked on a dairy farm using a stolen ID and Social Security card after allegedly crossing the U.S.-Mexico border as a child.

Now, Bahena-Rivera has dropped Richards as his attorney, hiring married couple Chad Frese and Jennifer Frese to represent him in the murder trial, the Des Moines Register reports.

Bahena-Riveras switch of attorneys means that his demands and an attempt at a gag order on the media and government to stop calling him an illegal alien have all been dropped.

In the case of Tibbetts, the illegal alien allegedly stabbed the young woman to death after chasing her down, according to police. Investigators say Bahena-Rivera left Tibbetts body in a nearby cornfield, where he covered her with cornstalks.

A similar case was revealed in an exclusive report by Ben Ashford for the Daily Mail where a 17-year-old girl says she was similarly harassed by the illegal alien months before Tibbetts went missing on July 18. The girl said she was left fearing for her life after Bahena-Rivera attempted to chase her down.

Bahena-Rivera has a U.S.-born child with a young woman who went to high school with Tibbetts. The children of illegal aliens are often referred to as anchor babies, as they are eventually allowed to bring in an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country and act as an anchor for their illegal parents.

Federal immigration officials have previously confirmed to Breitbart News that Bahena-Rivera is in the country illegally. Investigators say he has been living in the U.S. from between four and seven years. The illegal alien is being held on a $5 million bond."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Macron Lashes Out at Italy over Sickening Efforts to Curb Mass Immigration,"Early this week, the Italian government turned away the ship Aquarius, operated by the French-German NGO SOS Mediterranee, which has been conducting search-and-rescue missions in North African waters since 2015.

The Leagues Matteo Salvini, now Italys Interior Minister, repeatedly accused NGO vessels such as the Aquarius of providing an illegal shuttle service for African migrants to Italy.

On more than one occasion, Salvini has denounced the NGOs for accepting financing from billionaire George Soros as part of his efforts to increase migration into Europe.

For years, the Italian government under Democrat leader Matteo Renzi threw up its hands over the immigration crisis, blaming Brussels for not taking stronger action while insisting its own hands were tied by rulings of the European Union (EU).

Malta joined Italy in closing down its ports to the Aquarius Monday, insisting that Malta is not the closest port-of-call to vessels leaving North African shores.

In his sharp rebuke Tuesday, Mr. Macron made no mention of his own countrys decision to close its southern borders with Italy to migrants, leaving Italy alone to deal with the roughly 640,000 migrants who have poured into the country since 2013.

The irony was not lost on Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who called out Macrons France as a hypocritical country, while insisting that Italy would not accept lessons from them.

Mr. Macron, who rose to power last year, has faced internal criticism from his own party for supporting measures to tighten asylum requirements.

Marine Le Pen, Macrons opponent in the 2017 runoff election, was much tougher on immigration, proposing a temporary suspension of all immigration. France, which rejected Le Pens position last year, has continued to suffer serious immigrant problems such as the recent armed brawls between migrants in Calais.

Growing security concerns resulting from his own policy have forced Macron to adopt stronger immigration measures similar to those proposed by Le Pen.

On Wednesday, French newspapers were abuzz over the tiff between France and Italy, noting that the Italian government had managed to place Europes migration crisis at the summit of issues to be urgently addressed by the European Union (EU).

Less than two weeks ago, Italys Giuseppe Conte assumed the office of Prime Minister, having formed a coalition government between the big-tent, anti-establishment Five Star Movement and nationalist League.

Mr. Conte, who heads Italys elected populist coalition government, has vowed to redistribute immigrants, pointing out that Italy has taken in some 640,000 immigrants over the past five years and demanding that other EU member states step up to ease the burden.

As Aquarius heads to Spain with its 630 passengers, Conte remains firm in his campaign promise to be the defense lawyer of the Italian people.

The Italian governments new immigration stance seeks to mend Italys flawed policies, which allowed unchecked mass immigration with no clear plan of what to do with those arriving."
2018-10-12,Breitbart,CNNs Don Lemon Uses Kanyes Dead Mother to Attack Him She Would Be Embarrassed by This,"We need to take the cameras away from Kanye and from a lot of this craziness that happens in the White House, because it is not normal and we need to stop sitting here pretending that its normal, Don Lemon said.

This was an embarrassment. Kanyes mother is rolling over in her grave, he continued.

I spoke to one of her friends today, or texted with one of her friends today from Chicago, Dondas friends, I used to live there, I know em. She said, Donda would be embarrassed by this. She would be terribly disturbed by this. And Kanye has not been the same since his mother died. He kept talking today about Oh, I put the hat on and the hat made me feel strong and wearing a capehe needs a father figure.

Many voiced their objection to what Lemon said on Twitter:"
2018-02-13,Breitbart,Report Education Department to Reject Transgender Bathroom Complaints,"BuzzFeed News says it was informed by the education department of the new policy:

Liz Hill, a spokesperson for the agency, responded yes, thats what the law says when asked again if the Education Department holds a current position that restroom complaints from transgender students are not covered by a 1972 federal civil rights law called Title IX. Asked for further explanation on the departments position, Hill said Friday, Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, not gender identity. She added that certain types of transgender complaints may be investigated  but not bathroom complaints. Where students, including transgender students, are penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes, that is sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX, Hill said. In the case of bathrooms, however, long-standing regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.

Anna Anderson, director of the Campaign Against Gender Ideology at American Principles Project, praised the reported move. In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Anderson said:

While no official rule has been issued by the Department of Education (DOE) regarding complaints filed by transgender students, we applaud the DOEs recent public statement revealing their principle guiding which cases to investigate and which cases should be dismissed. The agency strongly stated that no students should be harassed or bullied over sex-based stereotypes, such as the way they dress or wear their hair. At the same time, the DOE has rightly determined that it is not discriminatory to provide students private facilities separated by sex, such as showers, locker rooms, and bathrooms.

Anderson added that LGBT activists have spent the past few years demanding that the desires of one student should trump the fundamental privacy rights of all other students.

President Trumps administration has chosen a much better route than his predecessor, maintaining the rule of law and allowing schools and parents to find solutions to the bathroom question that respect the rights and dignity of all students, she said.

In January 2017, the Trump administration revoked former President Barack Obamas directive that required school officials to affirm the claims of children and teens who say they identify with the gender of the opposite sex. The policy forced children in public schools across the country to share bathrooms and other private spaces with students of the opposite sex.

In 2016, prior to the Trump administrations rescission of the Obama-era policy, a federal judge in Texas blocked the directive and applied the ruling nationwide.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer took to Twitter to condemn the report of the education departments announcement:

Polls have shown the Obama-era policy has had the support of less than 25 percent of Americans. Nationwide, fewer than 1 in 2400 adults have changed their names from one sex to the other sex, according to a study of the 2010 census.

The U.S. Education Department did not immediately respond to Breitbart News request for confirmation and comment."
2018-06-15,Breitbart,Texas Ed Board Nears Mexican American Studies Approval,"On Wednesday, the SBOE voted 15-0 to swap out course titles, propelling the high school elective closer toward final approval on Friday when board members cast their final votes.

In April, the SBOE actually approved the course based on the framework of an existing ethnic studies high school class offered in the Houston Independent School District. At the time, board member David Bradley (R-Beaumont) voiced concerns over the hyphenated term Mexican-American, commenting that he found hyphenated Americanism to be divisive. Bradley introduced an amendment to call the elective Ethnic Studies: An Overview of Americans of Mexican Descent. Despite Democrat board member opposition, the name passed.

Since then, Mexican-American Studies (MAS) advocates have contested it. This week, at the Austin-held SBOE meetings, MAS students and educators piped up during public comments. One speaker pleaded with the the board members to rename the class to honor those who came before us, adding that calling it Mexican American would not de-Americanize them.

Douglas Torres-Edwards, the curriculum manager for the Houston Independent School District and creator of their high school MAS elective, told the board, We are all Americans first.

Houston ISD is the states largest school district. In 2016-17, they reported that 62 percent of their enrolled students were Hispanic. That year, 52.4 percent of all publicly educated Texas children were Hispanic, according to the Texas Education Agency. In 2015, Houston ISD obtained state approval for their ethnic studies class through an innovative courses designation. Torres-Edwards authored the curriculum which is aligned to the states standards, the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS).

Still, for some, lingering reservations about ethnic studies courses remain, likely stemming from the Tucson public school scandal. In 2010, the Arizona Department of Education shut down their MAS program over allegations that incendiary class materials advocated for the overthrow of the United States government. In 2017, though, a federal judge overturned the Arizona law which banned Mexican-American studies.

Last year, the SBOE rejected textbook contender, The Mexican American Studies Toolkit, after a state panel of experts found highly-charged opinions and factual errors in the offering written by MAS activist Tony Diaz. The panel advised against the books adoption. Likewise, in 2016, the SBOE rejected Mexican American Heritage after MAS educators and students accused this textbook of being error-filled and racist.

Board member Georgina Perez (D-El Paso) formally proposed the preferred Mexican American studies title on Wednesday, prefacing there would be no hyphen in between Mexican and American. Bradley seconded the motion.

Later, Christopher Carmona, a MAS professor at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley, who testified in favor of incorporating Mexican American into the course title, told The Texas Tribune by email: We finally have our name back.

The SBOEs blessing will allow school districts to use state funds to pay for instructional materials, including textbooks. The Tribune noted no rule prevents schools from using a course title different from the official name Mexican-American studies. They may decide to identify as Tejano, Chicano, or something else."
2018-10-29,Breitbart,Angry Leftist Mob Disrupts Marsha Blackburn Campaign Rally with Lindsey Graham,"The two headlined an event held before a packed house at singer Ray Stevens CabaRay Theater in Nashville. Marsha Blackburn spoke for about ten minutes to the enthusiastic crowd of 500 that had been infiltrated by a small left-wing group.

When Blackburn called for a moment of silence to remember those killed at an attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh, the crowds silent respect was interrupted by one of the protesters who shouted at Blackburn.

You can watch that protester interrupt the moment of silence here:

One protester disrupted the event prior to Blackburns address and was removed by security and law enforcement.

Several protesters disrupted Blackburns address. All of them were removed by security and law enforcement.

During the time the protesters were being removed, the crowd shouted: USA, USA, USA!, followed by: Jobs, Not Mobs!

This Sunday afternoon, the liberal angry mob made it clear they are active in Tennessee and will stop at nothing to disrupt civil political discourse. Im grateful to the law enforcement officers who were here today and kept everyone safe, Blackburn said in a statement released by her campaign shortly after the event concluded.

The protesters at todays event were absolutely appalling. They yelled Impeach Trump. They kicked. They punched. They resisted law enforcement, and they interrupted a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh, Blackburn said.

Never in my life have I heard of people interrupting a moment of silence. Phil Bredesen is their leader, and their behavior is despicable, she concluded.

Blackburn faces Democrat Phil Bredesen in the November 6 election for the Tennessee U.S. Senate seat now held by retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN).

Most of the small contingent of left-wing protesters were removed from the event by the time Blackburn introduced Graham, the featured speaker, who received thunderous applause from the audience.

Im going to talk about two things: Marsha and Kavanaugh, Graham began.

The first thing I want to say is  any protesters left? Now is your time to stand up and be counted, a reference to the half-dozen protesters who attempted to disrupt Blackburns earlier speech by shouting and vigorously resisting attempts by security and law enforcement to remove them from the event.

Marsha will change the Senate. Shes got a determination that represents the best of Tennessee. She is reliable, and  to her opponent  why do you think Chuck Schumer is investing $12 million in you, if youre not going to be for him, Graham continued.

They have spent $12 million  the Senate Democratic PAC  in Tennessee. How many of you believe that Chuck Schumers working for bipartisanship? he asked the crowd rhetorically.

If you believe that, Graham said, somebody will drive you home because you dont need to be on the roads out here, to laughter from the audience.

You can watch Grahams opening comments here:

Marshas going to help Trump, Graham declared, then poked a bit of fun at both himself and the president:

Graham then turned his attention to the bad conduct of Democrat members of the Senate during the recent confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Grahams spirited defense of Kavanaugh during the Judiciary Committees hearings that heard the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford  who accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct more than 36 years ago but provided no corroborating evidence to support the accusation  and Kavanaughs response in testimony, is widely considered one of the key turning points in Kavanaughs successful confirmation by the Senate.

The reason they [the Democrats] were so awful to Kavanaugh is they dont want to recognize the fact that President Trump won the election. Now Im a conservative and Im happy about it, Apparently, if youre a liberal, youre not a very happy person, Graham said.

He then tore into the Democrats in the Senate for their handling of the Kavanaugh confirmation.

So Im going to talk about Kavanaugh. I have been in this business since 1995. I was pissed, Graham began, adding:

Up became down. It used to not be this way folks. Its not just about taxes and regulations and a million other issues on the ballot. Its an attitude. Who do you want to run your government? Do you want the people who were going to destroy this man to be in charge? They wanted power so badly, that theres nothing they wouldnt do. Betray Dr. Ford. Destroy Brett Kavanaugh. Take every law that we have and turn it upside down to get an outcome. I thought I was in some other country.

At the end of the day, I hope they pay a price. If we had failed to get Brett on the bench, nobody would be here today. There were 51 Republicans, and I said it and I meant it. Any Republican that didnt vote for him was supporting the most despicable thing Ive seen in twenty years in politics, Graham added.

He closed by concluding that Democrats needed to pay a price at the ballot box next Tuesday for the despicable way they treated Justice Kavanaugh.

After the rally, Graham and Blackburn held a joint press appearance at which Graham reiterated his strong support for Blackburn and other Republican Senate candidates.

Im going all over the country. Ive never really done this before. After the way Brett [Kavanaugh] was treated, I think we need a correction in Washington. Im tired of playing their game. Ive got a lot of good friends on the other side who gave into some pretty bad stuff, Graham said.

I do know Marsha. I can count on Marsha [in the Senate] when it comes to things I care about, he concluded."
2018-02-08,Breitbart,Conservatives Slam Schumer-McConnell Budget Deal,"Im not only a no. Im a hell no, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said on Wednesday.

The budget deal between Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell will increase defense and domestic spending by roughly $300 billion over the next two years; the Defense Departments budget will rise by $80 billion and domestic spending will increase by $63 billion in 2018 alone. The budget deal will also raise the debt ceiling for one year.

Its a Christmas tree on steroids, Congressman Dave Brat (R-VA) said, suggesting that the spending bill is full of pork-barrel spending.

Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) said,  This spending proposal is disgusting and reckless  the biggest spending increase since 2009. I urge every American to speak out against this fiscal insanity.

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) suggested that the budget will get support from a majority of House Republicans, however, the bill will not pass without Democratic support.

Meadows told Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough,  Im afraid that the deal theyre going to announce, Chuck Schumer will be very happy about that. The Freedom Caucus members wont later today because were going to increase the size of government some 13 percent.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said, This is a bad, bad, bad, bad  you could say bad a hundred times  deal. When you put it all together, a quarter-of-a-trillion-dollar increase in discretionary spending  not what were supposed to be doing.

Meanwhile, House Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-NC) said that the budget deal serves is a struggle for any one with fiscal concerns, although, he added that he remains increasingly likely to support the budget deal the longer Nancy Pelosi bloviates on the House floor.

Conservative activist groups remain equally opposed to the budget deal between McConnell and Schumer.

For years, Washington has been in a cycle of budgeting by crisisresulting in a series of last-minute and short-term spending packages that consistently increase spending, ignore the need for reform and restraint, and further burden the taxpayers of today and tomorrow. The current proposal to lift the bipartisan and previously agreed to caps set forth in the 2011 Budget Control Act by $300 billion is a betrayal of American taxpayers and a display of the absolute unwillingness of members of Congress to adhere to any sort of responsible budgeting behavior. In addition to irresponsible spending levels, this budget deal will include a number of other troubling provisions, including the extension or expansion of already-expired corporate welfare provisions through tax extenders as well as kicking the can down the road on the debt ceiling. Our network has consistently called on federal lawmakers to stand with the American people over special interests and eliminate corporate welfare as well as rein in out-of-control spending. This proposal is a massive failure on both accounts.

FreedomWorks Vice President Jason Pye declared on Wednesday, The deal announced today isnt just fiscally irresponsible, its an abomination. Once again, Republicans are retreating on the Budget Control Act and returning to their profligate ways. This deal will lead to higher budget deficits, possibly putting us over $1 trillion, and saddle future generations with more debt. No one in Congress who claims that theyre a deficit hawk or a fiscal conservative can justifiably vote for this deal."
2018-06-18,Breitbart,NFL Builds Their Own Field at London Soccer Stadium,"The National Football League has purchased a field and arranged for it to be permanently kept on the grounds of the new stadium being built for the Tottenham Hotspur. This will allow the field to be quickly switched out for football, whenever the stadium is not being used for futbol.

One of the complaints about American football in London has been that the type of grass pitch that soccer teams use does not have the proper footing for American football. That results in players slipping and sliding, and the middle of the pitch getting torn up. Nobody is happy with that. So the NFL is investing in a field that is specifically designed for American football. That field will be used for the first time on October 14, when the Seahawks face the Raiders.

This type of investment clearly shows the NFL is thinking long-term about their presence in England. Whether that materializes in the basing of an NFL franchise there, remains to be seen. What it means for now, however, is that several American fanbases are going to have to set their alarm clocks very early at least once a year, for the foreseeable future."

2018-06-16,Breitbart,CNBCs Harwood Trump Admin Chose to Inflict Cruelty of Border Family Separations Deliberately,"On Saturdays MSNBC Live, CNBC editor-at-large John Harwood stated the Trump administration deliberately chose to engage in a cruel policy of separating families at the border because the core impulse in this party right now is to prevent the United States from becoming more diverse and having more non-white people in the country.

Harwood said, Look, Alex, we have a president who is not honest, who lacks a moral sense, who lacks empathy. And what he is trying to do is deflect blame for a policy that he has caused to happen, and to do it while leading a party whose core appeal right now is to white people about resisting cultural and economic changes in the country that have made the country more diverse. The immigration issue has been hot in our politics for more than ten years now, but President Trump has taken it to a level that George W. Bush would find unrecognizable. Because the cruelty that is being inflicted by this policy is something that the administration has chosen to do deliberately. And its not stopping it, because the core impulse in this party right now is to prevent the United States from becoming more diverse and having more non-white people in the country."
2018-08-04,Breitbart,Maher Were Turning Into Iraq Where the Minority Has All the Power Thanks to Axis of Evil of Trum,"On Fridays broadcast of HBOs Real Time, host Bill Maher argued that the United States is going to be like Iraq under Saddam Hussein where a minority holds all the power because of the axis of evil of Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch, and Charles Koch.

Maher said, [T]he people who need the Constitution changed are the liberals. Its  were the ones its not working for.

He added, The Supreme Court should be 7-2 liberal. Because four of the justices were appointed by  two by Bush and now two by Trump, two presidents who lost the popular vote. Thats what I mean. The Electoral College works for them.

Later, after citing a study by the Weldon Cooper Center that by 2040, eight states will have almost half the US population and 16 states will have almost 70% of the population, Maher stated, 30% of the population will control 68% of the Senate seats, of course, because California with 40 million people gets two senators, and so does Wyoming with 8 people. So, it looks like were becoming this country where I feel like its Iraq under Saddam, and the liberals  go with me, right? Because the Sunnis were the minority, but they ran the country, right? They were a third of the country, but they were in power. And two-thirds of the country was the Shiites and they had no power, and were going to be two-thirds of the country, the liberals, but were not going to have any power, because of the axis of evil of Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch, and Charles Koch."
2018-06-16,Breitbart,Paul Ryans Amnesty to Increase Number of Anchor Babies on Welfare,"These children are commonly known as anchor babies, as they serve as an anchor to their illegal alien parents in the U.S. There are approximately 4.5 million anchor babies across the U.S., Breitbart News reported.

The amnesty deal, known officially as the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act, would give at least 1.8 million illegal aliens amnesty to permanently remain in the U.S., a population that is nearly three times the size of President Obamas original Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

A study by Tom Wong of the University of California at San Diego discovered that more than 25 percent of DACA-enrolled illegal aliens in the program have anchor babies. That totals about 200,000 anchor babies who are the children of DACA-enrolled illegal aliens. This does not include the anchor babies of DACA-qualified illegal aliens.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has noted that an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens will spur increased welfare usage by anchor babies, as amnestied parents of those citizen children are more likely to enroll their kids in federal welfare programs if they, themselves, are legal residents rather than illegal aliens.

Consequently, Ryans amnesty  which White House officials have reportedly pushed President Trump into supporting  would increase the number of anchor babies on welfare, leaving American citizens paying for those benefits.

Should President Trumps administration not enact major reforms to end illegal immigration  including constructing a border wall and ending birthright citizenship  the CBO estimates that at least another 600,000 anchor babies will be born to illegal alien parents in the next ten years.

The Ryan amnesty deal appropriates $25 billion for a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but there is no requirement for the wall to be built before the amnesty for illegal aliens begins. Additionally, the amnesty deal does not appreciably reduce legal immigration levels to compensate for the amnesty, leaving American citizens with the same mass legal immigration to the U.S. that has inundated the country for decades."
2018-07-03,Breitbart,Trump Warns WTO to Treat US Properly or He Will Act,"Trump made the comments while seated next to Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte, as the two prepared to hold a meeting in the Oval Office.

WTOs treated the United States very badly and I hope they change their ways, Trump told reporters of the current state of affairs between the U.S. and WTO. They have been treating us very badly for many, many years and thats why we were at a big disadvantage with the WTO.

President Trump then warned, Were not planning anything now, but if they dont treat us properly, we will be doing something.

Reports have swirled that the United States could potentially leave the WTO. Axios reported details of what it said was a leaked Trump administration drafted bill to declare Americas abandonment of fundamental World Trade Organization rules.

Last week U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer rebuked countries that have issued retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., citing a WTO basis that Lighthizer refuted as groundless legal theory."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,ACLU Honors Cecile Richards with Lifetime Achievement Award,"Upon accepting her award, Richards said, Leadership in America is coming from high school students, from Dreamers, from teachers, teachers striking on behalf of their students all across this country.

Leadership is coming from everyone whos fighting for a country where we lift everyone up and no one falls through the cracks and you better believe leadership is coming from millions of women in this country, the most potent political force in America, she added.

Richards, who presided over Americas largest abortion provider for 12 years, also cheered for Black Lives Matter which, she said, is demanding that mass incarceration is no longer used as a weapon to destroy and disenfranchise communities of color in this country.

Planned Parenthood, however, was founded by eugenicist Margaret Sanger, whose Negro Project worked to bring birth control to blacks in order to reduce their population. Sanger said the black population, and others such as the disabled, were unfit.

In America today, the percentage of abortions performed on black babies is 36 percent, even though blacks represent just 12 percent of the population.

Former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson, president of And Then There Were None  a ministry that helps abortion workers leave their jobs  said while Richards was honored for keeping families together, her former organization served to tear them apart.

Abortion tears families apart, irreparably separating mother from child, father from baby, and compels Planned Parenthood employees to work long hours under stressful conditions, taking them away from their families, Johnson, the author of Unplanned, said in a statement sent to Breitbart News.

I was even dissuaded from starting my own family when I worked at Planned Parenthood for fears it would take me away from my job, she continued.

Planned Parenthoods most recent annual report shows that it continues to perform over 320,000 abortions per year while offering no mammograms and minimal prenatal services to pregnant women.

The report also revealed Planned Parenthood boosted its profits by $21 million  27 percent  from last year as the group also took in nearly $544 million in taxpayer funding.

Abortions skyrocketed while cancer screenings and prenatal care plummeted under Ms. Richards leadership and the organization became a political force, not a healthcare provider, Johnson observed. Its not surprising the ACLU gave this award to Ms. Richards as they are longtime partners of Planned Parenthood, going to court to protect the abortion giants key money maker: access to abortion for any reason at any point.

Its my hope that Cecile Richards comes to realize the destruction Planned Parenthood has done to this nation and her part in it and turns away from the abortion industry, she said."
2018-07-13,Breitbart,Dem Rep Cohen I Regret Using the Term Purple Heart,"On Fridays broadcast of CNN Newsroom, Representative Steve Cohen (D-TN) stated that he regrets saying Peter Strzok deserves a Purple Heart and that he used the term metaphorically, not literally. I never literally thought the Purple Heart should have been given to Agent Strzok.

Cohen said, I said something at the hearings yesterday about Purple Hearts, which another network thats named for a four-legged animal has been making a big deal about. I regret using the term Purple Heart. I used it metaphorically, not literally. I never literally thought the Purple Heart should be given to Agent Strzok. But I do believe that he was being attacked because the FBI and the Mueller investigation were under attack. They do not need to be attacked. They are strong units defending America and these indictments go to prove it once again."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Report Jeff Zucker Renews CNN Contract Through 2020 Election,"Ive learned that the veteran broadcast executive, who has served as president of Time Warners cable news channel since 2013, signed a new deal several months ago that will keep him at CNN through the 2020 election, writes Joe Pompeo of Vanity Fair.

Reports of Zuckers contract extension follows the approval of AT&Ts $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, the parent company of CNN.

As Breitbart News Economics and Finance Editor John Carney wrote Tuesday, the decision by Judge Richard Leon is widely regarded as a major setback for Makan Delrahim, a Trumps appointee leading the Justice Departments antitrust division.

CNN, whose anti-Trump coverage has earned the scorn of the President and his supporters, did not place a single program in the top 25 in the month of May. Nielsen Media Research reported the networks ratings suffered a major collapse in May as the Fox News Channel dominated the cable news wars. Of all the major news networks, CNN experienced the biggest drop in primetime viewership, down a full 25 percent in May.

Zucker came under fire in December amid revelations he and other NBC executives knew of Matt Lauers sexual misconduct. During a 2008 Friars Club roast, Zucker joked about Lauer, Its just good to see Matt up here and not under my desk. I dont want to say Matt is a germophobe, but hes the only guy I know who uses Purell both before and after he masturbates.

In another joke, Zucker seemingly hinted that Lauers predatory behavior took a toll on his marriage. Matt was having some trouble at home with the wife, he quipped. He was sleeping on Bryant Gumbels couch. Whats more boring than that? Two white men watching golf.

President Trump taunted the CNN executive on Twitter in April, calling him Little Jeff.

Check out the fact that you cant get a job at ratings-challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump? Trump tweeted. Little Jeff Zuker [sic], whose job is in jeopardy, is not having much fun lately.

They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting! he added."
2018-07-25,Breitbart,More Dem Candidates Against Pelosi for Speaker,"Ohio Democrat Danny OConnor, who is running in Ohios 12th Congressional District, told MSNBCs Chris Matthews that he would not support Pelosi if elected and Democrats take back the House.

We need change, he said. We need to have new leadership on both sides.

OConnor, who is running in a District Trump won by double digits in 2016, answered, No.

Max Rose, the Democrat running in New Yorks 11th Congressional District, told CBSN on Tuesday that he would also not vote for Pelosi. Rose, who CBSN noted is running in the only New York Congressional District Trump carried in 2016, said Democrats are in urgent need of new leadership.

The party has lost the trust of voters, not only in my district, but throughout the country, and believe me, if you separate the parties and you just look at our policies  infrastructure, equitable growth, lowering per capita health care costs  those policies have massive support, Rose reportedly said. But weve got to move towards being also a party that can garner peoples trust and keep it, and were not going to accomplish that without new leadership,

When asked if he would support Pelosi, he also said, No.

Democrat Conor Lamb (D-PA) won his special election in Pennsylvania earlier this year while running ads telling voters he would not back Pelosi, and many younger Democrats saw Lambs victory as a sign that the party may be better off without having Pelosi as one of its most prominent faces.

Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) said on Sunday that Democrats need a new generation of leadership and must be honest about the problems that we face, making it clear that he believes Democrats need a leader not named Pelosi.

Pelosi, though, has been adamant that she will run for Speaker if Democrats take back the House.

We will win. I will run for Speaker. I feel confident about it. And my members do, too, Pelosi told the Boston Globe this year.

If Democrats take back the House, Pelosi will have significant advantages. Not only is she the partys best fundraiser in Congress and known for her vote-counting abilities, but Democrats do not have a consensus alternative to Pelosi. The House Minority Leader may also want to become Speaker again to make it easier for her to choose her potential successor."

2018-07-11,Breitbart,Woman Arrested for Allegedly Beating 92-Year-Old Los Angeles Man with Brick,"The Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department announced that officials arrested Laquisha Jones, 30, of Los Angeles, Tuesday night and charged her with assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly beating Rodolfo Rodriguez as he was walking down a sidewalk, KABC reported.

Police made the arrest after identifying Jones in a witness photo of the incident, depicting the woman holding a piece of concrete and walking with a young girl by her side.

Witnesses and investigators said that one woman and several men attacked Rodriguez with the block of concrete because Rodriguez allegedly bumped into the young girl while walking down the street.

The woman pushed him and dropped him. She took the block of concrete and hit him in his head many times, a witness said.

The beating left Rodriguez with injuries to his face, cheekbone, head, and ribs. He is recovering from his injuries at home after being released from the hospital.

Rodriguezs family created a GoFundMe page to raise money for his medical expenses. As of Wednesday morning, the page raised more than $256,000."
2018-06-19,Breitbart,DHS Nielsen Defends the Law as Media Mob Urges End to Enforcement,"Here is the bottom line, Nielsen told a roomful of reporters who were pushing the Democrats claim that President Donald Trump can and should stop the Executive Branchs policy of enforcing Congress immigration laws.

Under Trumps strict enforcement policies, officials are charging all illegal border-crossers with crimes. Once migrants face criminal charges, they are detained while their children are moved to shelters operated by the Department of Health and Human Services. Officials hope that the enforcement of the law will reduce the northward migration of poor people seeking jobs in the U.S. labor market.

The sudden enforcement of popular immigration laws is a shock to the media, partly because immigration laws have rarely been enforced during the last 30 years, so forcing down the wages of the blue-collar workers who provide myriad services to upper-income Americans each day.

For example, former President Barack Obama largely ended the deportation of illegals living in the United States and actually gave work permits and Social Security Numbers to almost 800,000 DACA illegals. He pushed to give work-permits to roughly 3 million older DAPA illegals but was stopped by the courts, not the GOP, many of whose donors and legislators tacitly support cheap-labor illegal immigration.

In the press room, Nielsen faced down reporters who suggested that her enforcement of the border laws is optional, driven by politics, or is child abuse, and that the Executive Branch should unilaterally pause, rethink, refrain, or stop enforcing Congress law:

Q    I mean, that is the big message here.  Members of Congress on the Democratic side say that youre using children as a lever to try to get them to take legislative action.  What do you say to that? ... And this policy is not, by your definition, in any way, cruel? SECRETARY NIELSEN:  Its not a policy.  Our policy at DHS is to do what were sworn to do, which is to enforce the law ... Q    Yeah.  Madam Secretary, President Trump has had a lot to say the last few days about immigration, but hes offered no compassion to the families that are being separated at the border.  Do you know why that is?  And why wont he simply pause your departments enforcement of this administration policy until Congress reaches that long-term fix so that these families can be reunited? SECRETARY NIELSEN:  He has been attempting to work with Congress since hes been in office.  Hes made it very clear that we will enforce the laws of the United States as long as this administration is here. Q  ... given the blowback by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats, are you considering rethinking this based on feedback?  Or is this the administrations position going forward  period, paragraph? SECRETARY NIELSEN:  The laws prohibit us from detaining families while they go through prosecution for illegally entering the border, and while they go through prosecutions for immigration proceedings... Q    Thank you very much.  Are you intending for this to play out as it is playing out?  Are you intending for parents to be separated from their children?  Are you intending to send a message? SECRETARY NIELSEN:  I find that offensive.  No.  Because why would I ever create a policy that purposely does that? ...  But the answer is, its a law passed by the United States Congress.  Rather than fixing the law, Congress is asking those of us who enforce the law to turn our backs on the law and not enforce the law.  Its not an answer.  The answer is to fix the laws. Q    Will the administration refrain from its current policy if Congress were to pass something thats close to what you want?  Or will it continue to require the separation of parents from their children until the President gets exactly what he wants? SECRETARY NIELSEN:  If Congress closes the loopholes, some of which  many of which are closed in the two bills that we hope are taken up this week by the House, then they close the loopholes and the families will stay together throughout the proceedings.

Throughout the press event, Nielsen had to remind the reporters that she is obliged to execute laws passed by Congress, even if she opposes the laws. She said:

The laws prohibit us from detaining families while they go through prosecution for illegally entering the border, and while they go through prosecutions for immigration proceedings.  If we close the loopholes, we can keep the families together, which is what they did in the last administration until a court ruled that we can no longer do that.  After 20 days, we have to release both unaccompanied children and accompanied children  which means that we cannot detain families together.  The only option is to not enforce the law at all. We no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law.  Everyone is subject to prosecution. That is in accordance with the TVPRA  a law that was passed by Congress  and a following court order, neither which are actions the Trump administration has taken. Lets be clear: If an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States, they would go to jail and they would be separated from their family.  This is not a controversial idea. Parents who entered illegally are, by definition, criminals.  Illegal entry is a crime as determined by Congress.  By entering our country illegally, often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants have put their children at risk. The answer is, its a law passed by the United States Congress.  Rather than fixing the law, Congress is asking those of us who enforce the law to turn our backs on the law and not enforce the law.  Its not an answer.  The answer is to fix the laws. If Congress closes the loopholes, some of which  many of which are closed in the two bills that we hope are taken up this week by the House, then they close the loopholes and the families will stay together throughout the proceedings.

Amid the media uproar, 49 Democratic Senators have co-sponsored a bill which would block border enforcement and allow millions of young men and women easy access to the U.S. job market, providing they also bring a child. Californias Sen. Diane Feinsteins Keep Families Together Act would bar law-enforcement officials from detaining migrants who bring children northwards. The draft bill says:

Many of the manual jobs sought by migrants deliver cheap services to upper-income Americans, such as D.C. professionals. Those services include bussing restaurant tables, dry-cleaning clothes, mowing lawns, and cleaning wine glasses.

If allowed, most of the migrants will work long hours at wages far lower than those needed by blue-collar Americans, partly because many of the migrants are in bondage debt to the violent cartels who let them pass through their border territory. Nationwide, roughly 8 million illegals immigrants  plus roughly 400,000 Central Americans who have filed for asylum  are already helping to hold down blue-collar wages.

Despite media protests, the border laws are very popular, partly because the public does not want their wages and salaries pushed down by a wage of cheap migrants. However, many Americans also sympathize with the migrants and are reluctant to see them excluded.

In 2014, this tension snapped amid a huge inrush of more than 100,000 migrants who were encouraged by former President Barack Obamas pro-migration policies. Public opinion turned sharply against the migrants and Obamas ratings crashed by 25 points. In late July of 2014, Obamas border policies were opposed by 58 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of independents. An AP/GFK poll in July showed 57 percent strong disapproval of his border policies. A Fox poll in July showed that 52 percent of independents said the children should be sent home as soon as possible. A July 31 Washington Post article said Immigration has emerged as perhaps President Obamas worst issue  definitely for today, and maybe of his entire presidency."
2018-02-09,Breitbart,Democrat Woman Leading MeToo Investigated for Sexual Misconduct,"Daniel Fierro of Cerritos told Politico that when he was a 25-year-old staffer to Assemblyman Ian Calderon (D-Whittier) in 2014, an inebriated Garcia cornered him while he was alone after the annual Assembly softball game in Sacramento. She reportedly began stroking his back, then squeezed his buttocks and attempted to touch his crotch before he removed himself from the situation.

Politico notes that a prominent Sacramento lobbyist  who spoke on condition of anonymity  also complained about being sexually harassed by Garcia in May 2017. Garcia allegedly tried to grab his crotch at a political fundraiser hosted by Governor Jerry Brown for state Senator Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) at the de Veres bar in Sacramento. Garcia was allegedly inebriated.

She spotted him and said,Where are you going? the lobbyist said. She came back and was whispering real close, and I could smell the booze and see she was pretty far gone, he said. She looked at me for a second and said, Ive set a goal for myself to fuck you. At that point, Garcia stepped in front of me and reaches out and is grabbing for my crotch, he said. That was the line in the sand, according to the lobbyist, and he stopped her. I was four inches from her, eyeball to eyeball  and I said, That aint gonna happen.'

Ironically, Garcia told the New York Times that she was a victim of sexual harassment by men in the Capitol saying, Multiple people have grabbed my butt and grabbed my breasts . . . Were talking about senior lobbyists and lawmakers.

In a statement to Politico on Thursday, Garcia said she had zero recollection of the alleged events:

Every complaint about sexual harassment should be taken seriously, and I will participate fully in any investigation that takes place. The details of these claims have never been brought to my attention until today. I can confirm that I did attend the 2014 legislative softball game with a number of members and my staff. I can also say I have zero recollection of engaging in inappropriate behavior and such behavior is inconsistent with my values.

2018-07-08,Breitbart,Anti-Gun Protesters Shut Down Major Chicago Highway,"The left-wing protesters, led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Catholic priest Father Michael Pfleger, shut down all northbound lanes of Chicagos Dan Ryan Expressway on Interstate 94 Saturday morning after a standoff between the police and the demonstrators.

The marchers carried signs that read, We need jobs, and chanted, Stop the killing, as they walked down the 1.5-mile stretch of highway to let lawmakers know their desire for better schools, more jobs, and stronger gun control laws to combat the violence in their communities.

Some children even stopped to use chalk to write the words, Enough is enough, along the highway route.

When people keep ignoring you, you take it up a notch, Pfleger said. We are going to continue to take it up a notch until we get responses.

The Illinois State Police reached an agreement with the demonstrators early Saturday morning that the protesters could take up two northbound lanes and allow traffic to pass through the other two lanes.

Gov. Bruce Rauners office said in a statement that protesters who ignored the boundaries set by highway workers would face arrest and possible prosecution.

But Pfleger and other protesters ignored the warnings, saying they would occupy the entire northbound section of the highway.

After hearing of the chaotic situation that led to the shutdown of the highway, Rauner tweeted his disappointment in Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel for not controlling the protesters.

Emanuel quickly fired back at the Illinois governor, tweeting that he should delete his account for criticizing the peaceful protest.

Rauner later thanked law enforcement for their efforts to police the massive protest.

The Dan Ryan Expressway, which encompasses parts of Interstate 94 and 90, has a history dating back to the 1960s when it was believed to be a symbol of racial segregation because of how it served as a divider between white neighborhoods and poor black neighborhoods.

Chicago had its fair share of homicides and shootings in the first six months of 2018. Chicago police said the city counted 252 homicides and 1,100 shootings during that period, mostly in low-income, predominantly black neighborhoods."
2018-11-27,Breitbart,Italian Populist Salvini Expresses Support for French Yellow Jacket Protests,"Interior Minister Salvini posted a clip from Italian public broadcaster RAI on Twitter that featured a member of the Yellow Vest movement chanting, Salvini! Salvini behind an Italian reporter covering the protests that took place in the French capital of Paris on Saturday.

Salvini commented on the video saying, Its nice to know you have supporters even among the French tired of Macron...

One of the most vocal supporters of the Yellow Vests has been Rassemblement National (National Rally) leader Marine Le Pen, who is also a close ally of Salvini with both leaders meeting and promising to combine their efforts into a freedom front ahead of the European Parliament elections next May.

Le Pen has also extensively commented on the Yellow Vest protest in Paris, telling media that she condemned the violence seen on the Champs Elysees saying, Of course we condemn the violence. But often, this violence emanate from the same: the black blocs, the Antifa groups. The most serious violence comes from these extreme leftist groups.

According to broadcaster RTL, many of those arrested were members of far-left extremist groups and had come to the protest simply to do damage.

The comments from Salvini come after President Emmanuel Macron identified him and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as his main ideological opponents in the European Union.

I will not give anything away to the nationalists and those who defend hate speech, Macron said in August, adding, If they want to see me as their chief adversary, they are right.

Salvini and Prime Minister Orban also met earlier this year and promised to cooperate with each other, with Orban going as far as revealing that he believed Salvini to be a hero, and adding that he believed the Italian to be a companion of my destiny."

According to Rice, President Obama and Comey had a follow-on conversation after the formal meeting during which Obama told Comey that from a national security perspective he wanted to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia. President Obama then asked Comey to inform him of any changes that would affect how his White House should share classified information with the incoming Trump administration.

Separately, Rice claims Obama told Comey that  he wanted the Russia investigation handled by the book and that from a law enforcement perspective he was not asking about, initiating or instructing anything.

Rice herself claims to have been present at the meeting and to have stayed for this follow-on conversation, along with then-Vice President Joe Biden, and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who weeks later would become a darling of the left-leaning press after she was fired over her refusal to enforce President Trumps first travel ban on certain terror-prone Muslim majority countries.

The Senate Judiciary Committee obtained the email from the National Archives as part of its investigation into potential political bias and influence in the FBIs handling of the Russia investigation and the infamous Fusion GPS dossier that was used to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant on one-time Trump associate Carter Page.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee chairman, announced their discovery of the email Monday when they released a letter they addressed to Rice on February 8. The two senators tell Rice:

It strikes us as odd that, among your activities in the final moments on the final day of the Obama administration, you would feel the need to send yourself such an unusual email purporting to document a conversation involving President Obama and his interactions with the FBI regarding the Trump/Russia investigation.  In addition, despite your claim that President Obama repeatedly told Mr. Comey to proceed by the book, substantial questions have arisen about whether officials at the FBI, as well as at the Justice Department and the State Department, actually did proceed by the book.

The public version of the letter includes a redacted version of Rices email indicating it once held a top secret classification. The letter makes reference to an unredacted still-classified version of the email.

2018-02-08 CEG LG to Rice (Russia Investigation Email) by Breitbart News on Scribd

Grassley and Graham are demanding Rice provide their Committee answers about her email by a February 22 deadline. The questions included are as follows:

1. Did you send the email attached to this letter to yourself? Do you have any reason to dispute the timestamp of the email? 2. When did you first become aware of the FBIs investigation into allegations of collusion between Mr. Trumps associates and Russia? 3. When did you become aware of any surveillance activities, including FISA applications, undertaken by the FBI in conducting that investigation? At the time you wrote this email to yourself, were you aware of either the October 2016 FISA application for surveillance of Carter Page or the January 2017 renewal? 4. Did anyone instruct, request, suggest, or imply that you should send yourself the aforementioned Inauguration Day email memorializing President Obamas meeting with Mr. Comey about the Trump/Russia investigation? If so, who and why? 5. Is the account of the January 5, 2017 meeting presented in your email accurate? Did you omit any other portions of the conversation? 6. Other than that email, did you document the January 5, 2017 meeting in any way, such as contemporaneous notes or a formal memo? To the best of your knowledge, did anyone else at that meeting take notes or otherwise memorialize the meeting? 7. During the meeting, did Mr. Comey or Ms. Yates mention potential press coverage of the Steele dossier? If so, what did they say? 8. During the meeting, did Mr. Comey describe the status of the FBIs relationship with Mr. Steele, or the basis for that status? 9. When and how did you first become aware of the allegations made by Christopher Steele? 10. When and how did you first become aware that the Clinton Campaign and the Democratic National Committee funded Mr. Steeles efforts? 11. You wrote that President Obama stressed that he was not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. Did President Obama ask about, initiate, or instruct anything from any other perspective relating to the FBIs investigation? 12. Did President Obama have any other meetings with Mr. Comey, Ms. Yates, or other government officials about the FBIs investigation of allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Russia? If so, when did these occur, who participated, and what was discussed?

The January 5, 2017 meeting Rice references in her email would have occurred just months after, as Rice herself has admitted, she unmasked certain Trump campaign members communications during the transition.

Rice, who in her retirement from public service has taken up a research post at American University, has remained critical of the Trump administrations foreign policy, but has largely refrained from weighing in on the Russia investigation."
2018-02-13,Breitbart,Klein Yes President Trump Israel Does Want Peace,"The U.S. President seems to have done so when he overlooked Israels persistent, some might even argue counterintuitive attempts to make peace with an intransient, extremist Palestinian Authority during an interview published on Sunday with the Israel Hayom newspaper.

Trump stated that he is not necessarily sure that Israel is looking to make peace. He made the astonishing statement just after saying he doesnt believe the Palestinians are seeking peace, thus, perhaps unintentionally, drawing an equivalence between a democracy and beacon of morality that has engaged in countless good faith peace talks, and a terrorist-supporting entity that incites against Israel, celebrates Jew killers, refuses to recognize the existence of the Jewish state and pays monthly stipends to the murderers of Israelis.

Trump responded thusly when asked to comment on reports of a forthcoming U.S.-brokered peace plan:

We are going to see what goes on. Right now, I would say the Palestinians are not looking to make peace, they are not looking to make peace. And I am not necessarily sure that Israel is looking to make peace. So we are just going to have to see what happens.

Trump might want to review the extraordinary lengths to which Israel has gone in order to give peace a chance. Israel offered the Palestinians a state with territory in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, 2008, and during U.S.-brokered talks in 2013 and 2014. Israel has since been willing to restart talks at any time.

According to some reports, Israel went so far as to offer the Palestinians control of the Temple Mount, Judaisms holiest site, in at least two separate, desperate bids to make peace.

In each of these cases, without any exception, the Palestinian Authority rejected Israels offer of a state and bolted the negotiations. In most cases, they countered statehood offers with major escalations in violence, including infamously launching the deadly Second Intifada, or terrorist war, in response to the Camp David peace talks.

Netanyahu himself arguably jeopardized Israeli national security in a failed bid to get PA President Mahmoud Abbas to the negotiating table. He released Palestinian prisoners, including terrorists, in a so-called gesture to jumpstart talks with Abbas. This despite the well-known high rate of released Palestinian terrorists returning to their murderous ways and killing more Israelis. Few noted that the very need to release terrorists as a gesture to entice the PA into talks itself unmasks that same PA as the terrorist-promoting organization that it is. Netanyahu didnt stop there. He also imposed a freeze on settlement activity  meaning Jews building in historic Jewish communities in the West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem  as another gesture toward Abbas. The PA still didnt budge.

At this point, instead of repeating the same error over and over again, the U.S. and Israel might do well to reconsider the concept of what they are labeling as peace. The term essentially refers to Israel offering a state to the PA in hopes the Palestinians will not only accept the offer, but live side-by-side in peace with the Jewish state. That very premise is myopic, dangerous and fundamentally flawed.

There is no significant evidence to suggest that a Palestinian state run by a Palestinian leadership that openly supports terrorism and has been flirting with a unity deal with Hamas would be moderate or a force against regional radicalism. There is overwhelming evidence to support the charge that a future Palestinian state would encourage terrorism, remain in a permanent state of war with Israel and work to destabilize the region.

However, if we continue to insist on referring to Israeli territorial concessions to the anti-Semitic PA as peace, Israel has repeatedly proven it is willing to go out on a limb, to put in mildly, to make such accommodations.

2018-07-10,Breitbart,DHS Refuses to Reunite Children with Adults Who Arent Their Parents,"U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw, in response to an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawsuit, set a July 10 deadline to reunite the families and refused to provide additional time for the government to use DNA testing to determine if the people in question are even the 102 identified childrens parents.

Nevertheless, the government, in its Tuesday Joint Status Report notes that in at least 14 of the 102 childrens cases, they will not be reuniting them with parents because the adults in question are either not actually their parents, have been convicted of serious crimes, including rape and murder, or have been credibly accused of child abuse. The government will not place children with adults without completing these checks.

Let me be clear: HHS could have transferred every child out of our care to a parent who is currently in DHS custody today if we did not take into account child safety or whether the adult is actually the parent, HHS Chief of Staff Chris Meekins, told reporters.

Meekins went on to explain that three parents admitted they were not actually related to the children with whom they were ordered to be reunited when agents brought out DNA swabs to test parentage. Two others were proven to not be the parents when DNA tests were completed. Eight other purported parents will not be reunited with children due to failed criminal background checks that turned up serious convictions or child abuse. Our due diligence is protecting children, Meekins said.

According to the court filing, four children have already been reunited with parents. These parents have, according to DHS officials, been fitted with electronic monitoring bracelets and released into the United States because they brought children with them, illegally, across the U.S. border. This catch-and-release policy is effectively mandated for illegal aliens arriving with children younger than five by Judge Sabraws ruling, along with U.S. District Judge Dolly Gees refusal Monday to modify 1997s Flores Settlement.

The illegal alien parents of 51 more children are likely eligible for the same catch-and-release treatment. Thirty-four have been found to be the actual parents and passed criminal background safety measures and are expected to be placed with children Tuesday, the other 17 are at various stages of completing those checks. An additional 20 children have purported parents with whom they cannot be reunited because those adults have already been either removed from the United States or released into the country, which removes DHS and HHSs ability to force them to come get the children they claim are theirs.

Update: An earlier version of this article misattributed Chris Meekinss statements to an ICE official."
2018-07-13,Breitbart,NBCs Chuck Todd Strzok Hearing In Same Category as McCarthyism,"Friday on MSNBC, the host of NBCs Meet the Press, Chuck Todd criticized the congressional hearing for the way Peter Strzok, the FBI agent removed from special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russias 2016 election interference, was treated.

Todd said, I dont want to use the word McCarthyism loosely, but history is going to treat that hearing very unkindly. It is going to be in the same category of embarrassing moments in congressional history. At the top will always be Mr. McCarthy and what happened there. This will be in the top five of embarrassing moments.

He continued, This is a public servant, not a political actor. The way he was treated, the conspiratorial nature, and as bad as it looked yesterday, given these serious indictments  and do you know how much work goes into identifying 12 by name Russian operatives that did this? It looks even worse after seeing these indictments. Does anybody on that Republican side of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee care one iota about what the Russians did? It doesnt look that way, the way they asked the questions yesterday."
2018-02-09,Breitbart,Offsetting DACA Amnesty with Reduction to Legal Immigration Remains Key to Gaining White House Suppo,"Despite multiple attempts by Senate Democrats and the Republican establishment to craft amnesty legislation designed to get President Trump to cave on his immigration commitments, the White House has not signed onto any immigration legislation, except one bill.

Rep. Bob Goodlattes (R-VA) Securing Americas Future Act is still supported by the White House, an official confirmed to Breitbart News.

Goodlattes legislation would allow the nearly 800,000 illegal aliens enrolled in the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to remain in the U.S., an amnesty of sorts that would break a commitment previously made by Trump.

The exchange for that amnesty, pro-American immigration reformers tell Breitbart News, would be something much greater: Immediately ending chain migration, ending the Diversity Visa Lottery, and mandating E-Verify.

Chain migration is the process whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S., creating a never-ending flow of low-skilled foreign nationals arriving in the country.

Under the Goodlatte bill, chain migration  which has imported more than 9.3 million foreign nationals to the U.S. in the last decade  would be ended and confined to only spouses and the minor children of newly naturalized citizens. Another provision creates a temporary visa program for the parents of naturalized citizens that claims it will come at no cost to American taxpayers.

The number of extended-family foreign nationals who have resettled in the U.S. in the last decade is greater than the total combined population of Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, and Cleveland, the White House has noted in a recent ad campaign that seeks to explain and end chain migration.

The Goodlatte bill also eliminates the controversial visa lottery. Currently, the visa lottery randomly gives out 50,000 visas annually to foreign nationals from a multitude of countries. The countries include those with terrorist problems, including Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Yemen, and Uzbekistan.

Further, the Goodlatte bill is the only proposal in the Senate and House thus far that exchanges a DACA amnesty for mandatory E-Verify, a system that would ban employers nationwide from hiring illegal aliens over Americans.

The mandatory E-Verify provisions in Goodlattes bill are so potent that even if illegal aliens use stolen Social Security numbers to get jobs in the U.S., the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would be required to alert Americans that their Social Security number is being used in the workforce.

The White Houses own framework for an immigration plan, which gives amnesty to DACA illegal aliens, is much weaker in its efforts to offset an amnesty with immigration reforms that would benefit Americans.

For example, as Breitbart News has reported, the White House plan would not immediately end chain migration, allowing for at least four million chain migrants to continue entering the U.S. over a ten to potentially 20-year period.

The White House plan also expands the amnesty beyond illegal aliens enrolled in DACA to those eligible for DACA as well, a maneuver that could result in an amnesty that is uncontrollable. While eliminating the Visa Lottery, the White House plan merely repurposes the roughly 55,000 visas to import more white-collar foreign workers to take American jobs.

The plan also does not include any provisions to mandate E-Verify, punish sanctuary cities that harbor criminal illegal aliens, nor does it deal with the issue of anchor babies U.S.-born children of illegal aliens who are rewarded with U.S. citizenship.

Every year, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.

Mass immigration has come at the expense of Americas working and middle class, which has suffered from poor job growth, stagnant wages, and increased public costs to offset the importation of millions of low-skilled foreign nationals."
2018-08-22,Breitbart,White House Impeaching Trump a Sad Attempt by Democrats to Win Elections,"The idea of an impeachment is, frankly, a sad attempt by Democrats. Its the only message they seem to have going into the midterms, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said during the daily press briefing.

She said that Trump would continue working on issues that Americans care about, such as job and economic growth and enforcing immigration laws.

Democrats, Sanders said, are only focused on attacking the president and looking at political stunts to help them in the 2018 midterm elections. She repeated that Trump did nothing wrong, despite Cohens plea deal.

As the president has said and we have stated many times, he did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him, Sanders said during the White House press briefing.

Sanders took several questions about Cohen but referred details of the case to Trumps outside counsel.

Just because you continue the same questions over and over ... Im not going to give you a different answer, she told one reporter."
2018-07-17,Breitbart,Exclusive Adam Brandon on Jim Jordan for Speaker He Would Be Huge Part of Draining the Swamp,"FreedomWorks, a prominent conservative grassroots group, backed Congressman Jordan in April, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, for speaker to replace the outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan.

Brandon said in April, If Republicans in Congress really want to see the swamp drained, Rep. Jordan is the guy thats going to work with President Trump to get it done.

In May, more than 40 prominent conservative leaders sent an open letter to Congressman Jordan, urging the member to declare himself a speaker at once to replace Ryan. Jordan told Breitbart News in an interview in late June that he confirmed he will be a part of that discussion in the speaker race.

Brandon told Breitbart News that a potential Jordan speakership would help drain the swamp, contending that Speaker Jordan would control the legislative process to push bills that better fulfill President Donald Trumps legislative agenda.

Conservatives have been very good historically at politics and policy, but where we suck at is process, the FreedomWorks executive explained. The process is owned by the swamp. I see that Jim Jordan is going to be a huge part of that.

The conservative leader noted that Jordan, as speaker, would help return to regular order, which would avoid passing spending bills such as the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill signed by Trump in March and pass the rest of Trumps legislative agenda, such as repealing Obamacare and reforming welfare.

Brandon told Breitbart News, Jordan will make it very clear that another omnibus bill is not happening. I hate to say it because this crazy plan we have for Jim Jordan is to just return to regular order. I think its interesting for Jordan is that hes going to have a lot of members say that he is way too conservative. They may not agree with him but he wants to go back to that regular order.

The original Obamacare repeal proposal led by the House Republican leadership, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), was lambasted by conservatives and populists for not doing enough to repeal Obamacare. Other Republicans complained about Republican leadership bucking the regular order, instead, drafting the bill in secret. Conservatives labeled the bill RyanCare and Obamacare-Lite. Conservative and moderate Republicans complained that the rank-and-file members had little input in the drafting of the bill, which led to the original AHCAs defeat in the House last year. A revised AHCA only passed after then-Tuesday Group co-chairman Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) and House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-NJ) negotiated a more conservative Obamacare repeal bill.

Brandon then said that Jordan would put all Obamacare repeal and other high priority legislative items front and center. He added that under Speaker Jordan, Republicans would make tremendous progress repealing Obamacare.

FreedomWorks President Brandon said that if Jordan would serve as speaker, he would make Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) the most successful majority leader in history.

Brandon explained, If Jim Jordan becomes speaker, he will make Mitch McConnell the most successful majority leader in history. Jordan would save him. Why would he save him? Because he would send over really good pieces of legislation, and when it gets to the Senate, it gets closer to the center, and you still get a pretty good bill. This is what I never understood about Boehners leadership. Theyre starting on the 50-yard line; my understanding of football is that you start on your side and push them way back.

Brandon noted in April that Jordan had unanimous support from the FreedomWorks Activist Advisory Council. The FreedomWorks president explained why the conservative grassroots so eagerly backed Jordan for speaker. We pitched that we want to get involved in the speakers race behind Jim Jordan. I think that was unanimous and tested with our entire membership, and I joked it was almost like a Soviet Union-style thing. It was 95 on our list supported Jim Jordan. I thought it was going to be 75 percent. It goes back to what they know about Jordan; they know that he started the Freedom Caucus. The Freedom  Caucus has been their great salvation in Washington for the last few years. Thats the one group that has held out against the swamp for the last few years. The guy who founded it, thats obviously someone who theyre going to support.

Your currency in politics these days is authenticity, Brandon added.

Brandon concluded, Jordan and the Freedom Caucus have never let these folks down. Even if they disagree with them, they never let them down. They vote exactly the way they said they would. That just goes a long, long way."
2018-06-18,Breitbart,Grassley Disturbing that Comey FBI Employees Investigating Hillary Clinton Also Had Private Emai,"Last week Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz released his highly anticipated report on the FBIs handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The report revealed that Comey dramatically broke with bureau norms regarding his handling of the Clinton email investigation. The IG report also disclosed a text exchange between FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress Lisa Page in which Strzok told Page that Well stop it, when asked about Donald Trump potentially becoming the 45th President of the United States.

In his letter to FBI Director Wray, Grassley noted:

I asked you to explain to the Committee why the FBI failed to search or even request that Ms. Page and Mr. Strzok voluntarily produce official work-related material from their personal devices or e-mail accounts. My letter cites specific examples of texts that appear to be evidence of intent to use personal devices for work-related communications. The Committee has received no reply.

Chairman Grassley also wrote that Comey used a private email account and personal devices to conduct official FBI business. When interviewed by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) whether he was concerned about using private accounts for official agency purposes, Comey said, I dont know. I think so, but I dont know. I remember talking to Jim [Rybicki] about it at one time, and I had the sense that it was okay.

The Justice Department should apply at least as much scrutiny to its own former Director as it applied to the former Secretary of State, Grassley wrote in his letter.

Although it does not appear as egregious and prolonged, they also used non-government systems for official work. In the FBIs response to the Inspector Generals report, it claims, there is no finding or indication that any classified material ever transited former Director Comeys, Ms. Pages, or Mr. Strzoks personal devices or accounts. However, unless the FBI has obtained and examined those records, then it simply cannot know one way or the other.

In an interview, Comey said that the question of him transmitting classified information on unclassified accounts and devices is frivolous.

Chairman Grassley asked FBI Director Wray to answer the following questions by the end of the month:

It is disturbing that FBI employees tasked with investigating Secretary Clinton, including the former Director, appear to have engaged in strikingly similar conduct, Grassley remarked in his letter to FBI Director Wray."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,Nancy Pelosi Thanks Illegal Aliens for Breaking the Law to Bring Dreamers to USA,"The House, unlike the Senate, does not actually have a filibuster rule that allows members to speak as long as they want. Only the Speaker of the House and the party leaders can hold the floor indefinitely.

Pelosi said she was taking a stand to draw attention to the plight of the so-called Dreamers, who are illegal aliens brought into the country as minors.

During her remarks, she hailed the Dreamers, whom she said had arrived in the country illegally through no fault of their own.

She then went on to thank the parents of the Dreamers  i.e. those who deliberately broke the law.

I say to their parents: Thank you for bringing these Dreamers to America. Were in your debt for the courage it took, for you to take the risk, physically, politically, in every way, to do so, she said.

Democrats actually failed to pass any legislation on immigration when Pelosi was Speaker, though her party controlled both Capitol Hill and the White House from 2009 to 2011.

President Barack Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, using  or abusing  his executive powers of prosecutorial discretion on a massive scale to shield some 700,000 applicants from deportation.

Pelosi declared Wednesday that she would speak until Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) promised a vote on legislation to protect the Dreamers  something he has already promised to do, at least with regard to Republican legislation on the issue.

Just last month, President Donald Trump offered a deal that included a path to citizenship for all of the estimated 1.8 million Dreamers, including those who did not register for DACA. But Democrats rejected that deal over Trumps demand for a border wall, plus an end to chain migration and the diversity visa lottery.

Pelosis speech broke a record going back to 1909 for the longest speech on the House floor. Her stand was coordinated with protests by pro-amnesty groups against Trumps alleged white supremacy. Her speech may also have been aimed at impressing Democrats with her strength and stamina, in the midst of speculation that she could be forced to step down, either before or after the November midterm elections.

Republicans have made Pelosi a prime target in congressional races, and will privately welcome her extended tenure in leadership.

2018-06-18,Breitbart,Elon Musk Calls for Radical Improvements at Tesla to Hit Quarterly Targets,"In an email to all Tesla employees for their work on Model 3 production, CEO Elon Musk said that radical improvements are needed to reach quarterly targets set by the company, CNBC reports. In an annual shareholders meeting earlier this month, Musk stated that it was quite likely that Tesla would hit their Model 3 production rate of 5,000 cars a week by the end of this month. The company then underwent a broad restructuring and fired nine percent of its workforce.

Teslas harsh new approach to pushing company productivity has seemingly improved the confidence of investors, with stock trending higher following the shareholders meeting and even a 4.5 percent increase in stock price following the layoff of almost ten percent of the companys workforce. Musk himself bought approximately 72,000 Tesla shares costing him around $25 million, which coincided with a boost in Teslas share price from $342.77 on Tuesday to a closing price of $358.17 on Friday.

Despite this, Tesla currently remains one of the most shorted stocks on the market with many claiming that the company will be unable to raise the billions in capital that it needs to reach its future goals.

The email that Musk sent to employees on Friday can be seen below:

Subj. Only 8 days left to reach 700 cars/day or 5k/week Its getting very exciting! All parts of the Model 3 production system are now above 500 and some are almost at 700 cars already. Congratulations to all on making so much progress! That said, radical improvements are still needed in paint shop output, GA3, bringing up the new GA4, End of Line and Module Zone 4 at Giga. We also need to achieve sustained, 700+ per week on the body line. Wherever you are in the company, if you feel you can help out in any of those areas, please check in with Jat Dhillon on GA3, Jerome Guillen on GA4 and Omead on EoL and JB Straubel or Christ Lister on Module Zone 4. I will be at our Fremont factory almost 24/7 for the next several days checking in with those groups to make sure they have as many resources as they can handle."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Exclusive McCarthy Conservatives Will Not Be Silent About Online Censorship,"If these Americans did their homework in the days before the elections, they might have encountered a disturbing piece of fake news: Google search results listed the ideology of the California Republican Party as Nazism.

This reprehensible smear was an insult to millions of California Republicans, living and dead  especially those who, like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, worked to free the world from totalitarianism during World War II and the Cold War.

But this incident was not merely an insult. It was the latest in a trend to stigmatize and silence Americans who do not believe the latest in liberal ideology.

The people most profoundly affected by this censorship campaign are conservative Republicans.

According to a survey conducted by Emily Ekins of the Cato Institute, nearly three-quarters of Republicans and 60 percent of independents said they keep some of their beliefs private because of the hostile political climate. Less than half of Democrats said the same.

The last generation of conservatives spoke of a Silent Majority. Today there exists a Silenced Majority whose views are not represented  indeed, are not welcome  in powerful institutions like the mainstream media and elite college campuses.

In recent years, the censorship campaign has spread to Silicon Valley and especially social media, where some of the most important political debates in our country are taking place.

Like the Internet itself, Silicon Valley was founded on idealistic promises rooted in freedom of information and expression.

According to the old conventional wisdom, free and open social media would strengthen democracy by giving citizens access to information and platforms to share their beliefs.

Of course, that was before citizens started using social media to express thoughts and support candidates that some Silicon Valley liberals deemed unacceptable.

Recently, left-wing activists have pressured tech companies to take a different approach to their products.

These activists want the playing field to be tilted in favor of their politically correct worldview so that democratic outcomes like the 2016 presidential election can never happen again.

That is how the worlds largest search engine  responsible for 90 percent of all Internet searches  ended up spreading fake news about a major political party just days before an election.

And it isnt just one company that is affected by this problem.

During the 2016 election, Gizmodo reported that Facebook routinely suppressed conservative stories on its trending news section.

Similarly, Amazon banned the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) from its charity program. ADF is not just any organization. It is the legal organization that represented a Christian baker before the Supreme Court in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado  and won, in a decisive 7-2 verdict.

Yet Amazon, at the urging of the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center, says ADF is a hate group.

My colleague Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) found this out the hard way when Twitter rejected her pro-life campaign ad for being inflammatory.

The social media giant reversed its decision after an outcry, but other pro-life groups have not been so lucky. Their ads are still blocked, even as abortion groups like Planned Parenthood advertise without limit.

Censorship like this undermines public discourse and trust in our institutions  and it is likely to get worse before it gets better.

Hostility to free expression in Silicon Valley led Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, to write that he felt more comfortable discussing controversial ideas in Beijing than in San Francisco.

Altmans statement surely is an exaggeration, but it highlights the disturbing road that tech companies  and free speech itself  are traveling down.

Far-left activists are pushing Big Tech to go even further to suppress conservatives.

Gun control activists are calling on YouTube and Amazon to ban the NRA from its video streaming services.

Just last month, pro-choice activists stormed a Google developer conference, demanding that pro-life groups be erased entirely from certain Internet searches.

The social media phenomenon was supposed to be about radical curiosity, but it has descended into radical conformity.

Big Tech must not aid and abet this liberal crusade against the Silenced Majority. This must end, for the sake of our country.

In the coming weeks, I will join with my conservative colleagues in candid conversations with many of these companies to make it crystal clear this behavior is not only wrong but threatens the trust of institutions with so much potential for our country.

If Big Tech wants to regain the trust of the American people, it needs to live up to the principles it was founded on: freedom of speech and expression."

However, Clinton cited as late as July 2, 2016, that she had never sent material that was marked classified.

Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, Clinton said July 2, 2016. I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.

Comey only revealed the existence of those emails when he announced on July 5, 2016, that he was not recommending any charges against Clinton. He said in his statement that a very small number of her emails containing classified information were marked as classified.

Comeys revelation prompted PolitiFact to downgrade Clintons denials from Half True to False, and to note that Clinton should have known if any of her emails were actually marked classified since she had access to them.

The website wrote on July 6, 2016: While the evidence FBI director James B. Comey presented wasnt available to us, it was available to Clinton through her own emails. She had every opportunity to present an accurate accounting in comments to the public and voters. She did not do that.

The State Department on July 6, 2016, downplayed the emails marked classified, arguing they should have been unclassified but were not, due to human error.

Comey also played down Clintons false statements, testifying on July 7, 2016, that there were three emails marked classified, and that they did not have a classification header, but a (c) preceding the text in the body of the emails.

However, their dismissals contrasted with the alarm Strzok treated the emails with when he found out about them weeks earlier.

The text messages between Strzok and Page, who were having an extramarital affair, were released Wednesday by Senate Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI).

His committee is investigating how the Justice Department and FBI handled the Clinton email investigation. He issued an interim report that included the more than 400 pages of text messages the two sent each other, often late at night and into the early hours of the next day.

Then-FBI Director James Comey announced his recommendation that Clinton not be charged with any wrongdoing on July 5, 2016. Communications found by the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed he had drafted a statement exonerating Clinton in May 2016.

The Daily Callers Luke Rosiak pointed out that missing the emails may have been a mistake, since Clinton decided to print out 55,000 pages of emails instead of providing the State Department the digital formats, which prevented use of the search function.

Still, Strzok and Page indicated they found the oversight on June 12, 2016, and allowed Clinton to continue repeating her false statement until July 2, 2016."
2018-02-06,Breitbart,Amazon Ownership of Whole Foods Giving Employees Nightmares Tanking Morale,"The popular Texas-based niche grocery chain was bought by Amazon last year for a hefty $13.7 billion price tag, but employees are ruing the day the online retailer made the purchase, according to Business Insider (BI).

Employees feel hard pressed by the new policies Bezoss management team put in place at Whole Foods. The pressure put upon them by updated stocking procedures and pop quizzes is causing some to have nightmares about work.

I wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares, a Whole Foods staffer told BI. The stress has created such a tense working environment. Seeing someone cry at work is becoming normal.

One of the problems for employees is the new order to shelf (OTS) stocking system put in place by Amazon bosses. The system is apparently breaking down morale.

According to Amazon, OTS is geared to deliver smaller amounts of product to stores in order to keep it fresh and to help the company track inventory better. But OTS requires employees to stock shelves far more often and to keep a closer eye on stockroom supplies to prevent shortages.

According to BI, there have been growing pains with the system, and some locations have experienced product shortages.

Still, Amazon says that when it purchased Whole Foods, its locations had a million dollars of product that was spoiling and had to be thrown away. With the new system, that is no longer a problem.

On paper, things look good  our spoilage is in check, and I dont have a lot of back stock. But I have never seen so many empty shelves in my store, a manager told BI.

Customers have also noticed the lack of product, though, and many are questioning the new ownership, the site reports.

Still, BI also learned that with the OTS system, Whole Foods might be on track to saving $300 million in costs by 2020.

But it is another new management policy that seems to be giving employees the most stress. Managers have begun dropping pop quizzes on employees, replete with scorecards and a stiff grading policy. Less than 89 percent correct is a failing grade, which could lead to discipline or even termination.

The tests are brutal, say the employees BI spoke to:

Whole Foods is a favorite for many customers, but the new systems imposed by Amazon is causing some hiccups for the company. It remains to be seen if Amazons new systems will even out and bring profits."
2018-06-17,Breitbart,Secret Harvard Study Reveals Admissions Process that Hurts Asian Applicants,"The 2013 study by Harvards Office of Institutional Research was released as part of a court case in which the university is being sued for discriminating against Asian-Americans.

The study, as described by the Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, found that if admissions were based on academic performance and extracurricular activities alone, Asian-American applicants would comprise 43% of the freshman class. However, the actual percentage of Asian-American applicants was about half that.

The key appeared to be the inclusion of a personality component in evaluating applicants. Subsequent reporting by the Crimson revealed that traits included in personality were: humor, sensitivity, grit, leadership, integrity, helpfulness, courage, kindness and many other qualities.

Outgoing Harvard University president Drew Gilpin Faust tried to pre-empt the news in an e-mail sent to Harvard alumni and friends:

In the weeks and months ahead, a lawsuit aimed to compromise Harvards ability to compose a diverse student body will move forward in the courts and in the media. As the case proceeds, an organization called Students for Fair Admissionsformed in part to oppose Harvards commitment to diversitywill seek to paint an unfamiliar and inaccurate image of our community and our admissions processes, including by raising allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants to Harvard College. These claims will rely on misleading, selectively presented data taken out of context. Their intent is to question the integrity of the undergraduate admissions process and to advance a divisive agenda.

Harvard intends to fight the lawsuit, drawing on Supreme Court precedents that allow for the use of race as one factor in college admissions.

However, the effect of non-academic, and highly subjective, criteria in hurting the chances of Asian-American applicants is striking and may be difficult to explain away.

Harvard once used a quota system to restrict the number of Jews who could attend. Asian-American students have long suspected that they are disadvantaged in the admissions process through a more subtle method, which includes making room for other minorities at their expense. Now, they are learning that the admissions process may actively discriminate against them through supposed personality measurements that are open to cultural misunderstanding or even purposeful manipulation.

The lawsuit against Harvard is proving highly embarrassing to the university, whose leaders and graduates often pride themselves on their liberal credentials.

President Faust, for example, has overseen the renaming of Harvards residential house masters as faculty deans; has introduced new policies discouraging students from joining same-sex organizations; and has focused attention on the (rather minuscule) history of slavery at Harvard (as opposed to its long, boisterous history of abolitionism).

All of that political correctness now hangs in the balance as Harvard stands accused of racial discrimination.

2018-06-15,Breitbart,Scalise Shines But Dems Hammer Republicans 21-5 at Congressional Baseball Game,"However, the game did see one major highlight for the GOP. Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) made his return to the game after being shot by a Bernie Sanders supporter at a GOP baseball practice last year.

The crowd gave Scalise a standing ovation when took his spot at second base. More applause ensued after the first ground ball of the game went straight to Scalise, who then promptly retired the Democrat:

According to the Hill:

Members of the Capitol Police who were there for last years shooting also received applause Thursday night during the ceremonial first pitch. This year is really special with Steve Scalise coming back. Everybodys healed up. Just a very positive message, said Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), who is in his eighth year playing in the charity game. I love this game. I look forward to it, he said. We try not to bring the issues into this game, because its more about building relationships and some camaraderie so that tomorrow I can go talk to one of my Republican colleagues about the family separation issue or about a different issue and say, Look, I really need to talk to you about a serious issue,' Rep. Nanette Barragan (D-Calif.) told The Hill.

While the politicians may have put politics aside in order to have some fun playing baseball, several spectators had no problem making their political leanings known.

With another DACA vote scheduled for next week, some could be seen wearing shirts supporting DACA recipients.

President Trumps supporters were out in force as well, with several fans donning Make America Great Again apparel."
2018-02-13,Breitbart,Michael Malice Donald Trumps Unpredictability with North Korea One of the Most Powerful Assets in,"Pollak invited Malice, author of Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong Il, to offer his analysis of Trumps approach to international relations, his North Korea strategy in particular.

I am very, very optimistic, said Malice. The fact that [North Korea is] reaching out to South Korea, the fact that the entire U.N. denounced [North Korea], the fact that China is turning their back on [North Korea]  these are all positive steps  and the fact that North Korea doesnt know what to make of President Trump is one of the most powerful assets in negotiation you can possibly have. They knew Barack Obama wasnt going to do anything. I dont blame Barack Obama for not wanting to do anything, in a sense, because this is a nightmare with no easy solution. So theres plenty of blame to go around, and the only blame should be on the North Korean regime itself.

Trumps use of a good cop, bad cop approach towards North Korea with China is a very effective negotiating tactic, said Malice.

President Trump first got sworn in and the head of China came over to Mar-a-Lago, and they basically did a good cop, bad cop [strategy] with Trump as, Im fire and fury, and then, the Chinese president gets to be like, Come on. Work with us. Were a lot calmer and saner than President Trump, and thats a very effective negotiating tactic, said Malice. Frankly, its always going to be much more Chinas problem than ours because were never going to have millions of North Korean refugees crossing our border. Were not going to have a possible enemy up against our borders if the Koreas reunify as a U.S. ally.

News media criticisms of Trumps rhetoric towards North Korea as reckless  a narrative pushed and informally coordinated by many left-wing and Democrat-aligned news media outlets  neglect to consider the lack of results from decades of conventional political rhetoric in addressing North Korea, said Malice.

Over the summer, they were going to hit Guam, [and] everyone attacked him for his reckless rhetoric, and my point was, the non-reckless rhetoric hadnt gotten us where we wanted to be anyway; lets try something else, and Guam is still here, said Malice.

Trumps derision of Kim Jong-un as Rocket Man will cause problems for the North Korean head of states English-to-Korean translators, explained Malice:

Korean has several tenses, said Malice. They have a tense in North Korea thats used specifically for the leader, a form of address in their language. For their translators to translate things like Little Rocket Man, which is such a condescending offensive term, they wouldnt know what to do about it because the whole point is were supposedly scared of North Korea. Kim Jong-un has us terrified, and now the president is speaking about them with such disrespectful and contemptuous language; they dont know how to address this or deal with it because this completely breaks diplomatic protocol.

News media descriptions of Kim Jong-uns meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in as unprecedented are inaccurate, said Malice, pointing to meetings between North and South Koreas heads of state in 2000 and 2007.

This is also not unprecedented, said Malice. During the nineties, the South Korean Kim Dae-jung went to Pyongyang; he met with Kim Jong-il. They had something called the Sunshine Policy, which meant, Lets just give North Korea whatever the heck they want, and maybe theyll act civilized, and I have no problem with that because lets try everything, whatever works. Lets try bribing them if that works. But again, this is the context that the reporters are dropping. This is not unprecedented. They tried it before.

The United States should be flexible in its pursuit of peace across the Korean Peninsula, said Malice.

Theres no one whos a bigger fan of Korean peace than me, said Malice. I have been making the point very much to tone down the rhetoric  the idea that if Kim Jong-un insults us ... were going to bomb North Korea and kill millions of people. Im the biggest guy out there saying, Guys, take a step back. This is nuts. But I think its also important, again, to keep in mind who we are talking about. At this very moment, there are twenty million people under [Kim Yo-jongs] control who are not being given medicine for no reason; the medicine is there because they have to say if it doesnt come from government, you shouldnt have it.

2018-02-10,Breitbart,NYT US Spies Paid 100000 to Russian Claiming to Have Damaging Info on Trump,"After months of secret negotiations, a shadowy Russian bilked American spies out of $100,000 last year, promising to deliver stolen National Security Agency cyberweapons in a deal that he insisted would also include compromising material on President Trump, according to American and European intelligence officials.

The cash, delivered in a suitcase to a Berlin hotel room in September, was intended as the first installment of a $1 million payout, according to American officials, the Russian and communications reviewed by The New York Times. The theft of the secret hacking tools had been devastating to the N.S.A., and the agency was struggling to get a full inventory of what was missing.

Several American intelligence officials said they made clear that they did not want the Trump material from the Russian, who was suspected of having murky ties to Russian intelligence and to Eastern European cybercriminals. He claimed the information would link the president and his associates to Russia. Instead of providing the hacking tools, the Russian produced unverified and possibly fabricated information involving Mr. Trump and others, including bank records, emails and purported Russian intelligence data."
2018-06-15,Breitbart,Mitch McConnell Why Cant the Mueller Investigation Finally Wrap Up,"What I think about the Mueller investigation is, they ought to wrap it up. Its gone on seemingly forever and I dont know how much more they think they can find out, McConnell said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.

If the IG is through, why cant the Mueller investigation finally wrap up? the Kentucky lawmaker added.

McConnell previously signaled support for the Russia probe and blocked a vote on legislation in April to protect Mueller from being fired. The 76-year-old lawmaker told the Fox News Channel it was not necessary to vote on the bipartisan effort. Theres no indication that Muellers going to be fired, McConnell said to Neil Cavuto.I dont think the presidents going to do that and just as a practical matter, even if we passed [the bill], why would he sign it? President Trump on Thursday accused Democrats of fabricating a phony crime, prompting the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to investigate collusion with Russia. So, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News! the President tweeted. So, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!"
2018-02-13,Breitbart,Trump Nominates 11th Wave of Federal Judges,"Four of the nominees are for seats on the U.S. courts of appeals:

Andrew Oldham is a nominee for the Fifth Circuit. A graduate of the University of Virginia, Cambridge University, and Harvard Law School, Oldham formerly clerked for Judge David Sentelle on the D.C. Circuit and for Justice Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court. He is currently general counsel to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R).

Michael Scudder is a nominee for the Seventh Circuit. A graduate of Northwestern University, Scudder formerly clerked for Judge Paul Niemeyer on the Fourth Circuit and Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, then worked as a federal prosecutor, in the White House counsels office, and as general counsel to the National Security Council. He is currently a partner at a prestigious law firm.

Amy St. Eve for the Seventh Circuit. A graduate of Cornell Law School, she is a former federal prosecutor and private litigator. St. Eve is currently a federal trial judge on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois as well as an instructor at Northwestern Universitys law school.

Mark Bennett for the Ninth Circuit. Also a graduate of Cornell Law School, Bennett is the former attorney general of Hawaii and was a federal prosecutor prior to that.

The remaining five nominees are for seats on the U.S. district courts:

These nine judicial nominees showcase the continuing work of White House Counsel Don McGahn. Several of these nominees are conservative rock stars. Oldham and Scudder, in particular, are being praised by conservatives.

Top legal analysts tell Breitbart News that Oldham is off-the-charts brilliant, and are confident that he will be a warrior for originalism and textualism who could impact the law for a generation.

Scudder is likewise seen as an outstanding pick for conservatives, one whose excellent work, quiet and gentlemanly manner, and grace under fire over the years have earned him widespread support not only in GOP establishment circles, but even from some Democrats. Former White House Counsel Greg Craig, who served under President Barack Obama, has spoken out in support of Scudder as an outstanding lawyer whom liberals should respect for his ability and demeanor.

A couple nominees are picks who might still be right-of-center, but more moderate than the overwhelming majority of President Trumps nominees. These picks are for seats in very liberal states. One insider who spoke to Breitbart News off the record because he is not authorized to speak about internal deliberations said, They are probably the best picks you could expect from those states, getting Democrats support for them in exchange for not blocking other picks.

If so, this package carries all the hallmarks of a well-negotiated deal, one in which McGahn is the chief negotiator. McGahn is a leading member of the Federalist Society, which he joined decades ago, and is well known for his commitment to conservative legal principles. His hard-earned reputation as an unflinching defender of originalism and textualism buys him the only Nixon could go to China goodwill from GOP base leaders to negotiate the best possible deal on judicial selections.

President Trump is ready to produce historic numbers on judicial appointments in 2018, which entails both presidential nominations and Senate confirmations. Working with McGahn, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Attorney General Jeff Sessions are executing an ambitious plan to deliver those numbers by the 2018 midterm elections.

The president delivered remarks ahead of the Kavanaugh swearing-in ceremony at the White House and acknowledged that his opening statement was unusual.

Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception, he said.

Addressing Kavanaugh specifically, the president said, You sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.

The entire room of Trump supporters and staff applauded the entire Kavanaugh family.

The president also thanked Senate Majority Mitch McConnell for his efforts, urging him to stand to be recognized.

All of the Supreme Court justices were present for the ceremony, including the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, who performed the swearing-in ceremony.

Joining Kavanaugh at the ceremony were many friends and fellow legal professionals in Washington, as well as his parents and daughters.

After taking the oath of office, Kavanaugh spoke, vowing to serve the law in the Supreme Court.

I will always be humbled and proud to sit in Justice Kennedys seat on the Supreme Court, he said.

Kavanaugh also thanked McConnell for his leadership and steady resolve and the wisdom and fairness of Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley

He also singled out Senators Jon Kyl, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Joe Manchin for gratitude.

The Supreme Court is a team of nine and I will always be a team player on the team of nine, Kavanaugh said.

Kavanaugh also noted that all of his law clerks were women, a historic first on the Supreme Court.

He also thanked all of his friends, including his friends in high school, law school and the tight-knit Catholic community in the Washington, DC area.

Cherish your friends, look out for your friends, lift up your friends, Love your friends, Kavanaugh said, offering advice to young people and students. I love all my friends.

Kavanaugh also thanked Americans for their prayers on his familys behalf.

Ashley and I are grateful for the prayers from the thousands and thousands of people we have heard from throughout America, he said.

The newly appointed Supreme Court justice also paid special tribute to his wife.

She is a rock. I thank God every day for Ashley in my family, Kavanaugh said.

Kavanaugh acknowledged that the confirmation was contentious and emotional but said that he wished to be a force for stability and unity on the Supreme Court.

I was not appointed to appoint one party or one interest, but to serve one nation, he said."
2018-11-30,Breitbart,UN Secretary Rise of Nationalism Threatens Fight Against Climate Change,"I think that it is clear to me that the world is more polarized. We have more and more nationalist approaches being popular and winning election or having strong election results, Guterres said. We see the trust between public opinions and institutions  governments, political establishments but also International organization ... being eroded.

The BBC journalist who interviewed Guterres pressed him on President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement.

Is it a problem that the worlds most powerful man is a climate change skeptic? BBCs New York correspondent Nick Bryant asked Guterres.

Guterres did not criticize Trump but instead said it is more important that the fight against so-called manmade climate change should be a grassroots effort.

It always helps if everyone is in line with what we think, but we shouldnt reduce the discussion about climate change to the individual position of this or that leader, Guterres said.

Its a global issue, and we are all failing, Guterres said. And in a global issue, we need to mobilize everyone.

Guterres said that the Paris climate accord did not go far enough and called on countries to make an even more ambitious commitment to ending greenhouse gas emissions.

Things are getting worse than predicted but the political will today, unfortunately, is not as high as it should be, Guterres said.

As Breitbart News reported, the U.N. just released its Emissions Gap Report 2018:

Current national commitments are inadequate to bridge the emissions gap in 2030, the U.N. warned in its report.  Technically, it is still possible to bridge the gap to ensure global warming stays well below 2C and 1.5C, but if global ambitions are not increased before 2030, exceeding the 1.5o C goal can no longer be avoided. Now more than ever, unprecedented and urgent action is required by all nations, the report declared. The assessment of actions by the G20 countries indicates that this is yet to happen; in fact, global CO2  emissions increased in 2017 after three years of stagnation.

2018-06-13,Breitbart,Show Us the Money Iran Demands EU Compensation to Stay in Nuclear Deal,"In a phone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, Rouhani said Europeans must financially compensate Iran if they want to preserve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), following President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw from the deal and restore sanctions.

Rouhanis website quoted him as saying: We must not let this great achievement of diplomacy be destroyed by others unilateral actions, which are unfaithful to their promises.

Co-signers France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China want to preserve the JCPOA, which limits Irans nuclear activities in return for lifting international sanctions, and seek a way to keep Iran at the negotiating table.

U.S. President Donald J. Trump struck to a campaign promise last month when he withdrew the U.S. from the JCPOA, brokered under former President Barack Obama.

Mr. Trump predicted then that Iranians would someday want to make a new and lasting deal and that when they do, I am ready, willing and able.

He added that a new deal could lead to the peace and stability we all want in the Middle East.

Mr. Trump said Tuesday he hopes to negotiate a real deal with Iran over its nuclear program after Washingtons renewed sanctions kick in.

I hope that, at the appropriate time, after the sanctions kick in  and they are brutal what weve put on Iran  I hope that theyre going to come back and negotiate a real deal because Id love to be able to do that. But right now its too soon to do that, Trump told reporters in Singapore.

For its part, Iran is urging longstanding ally North Korea to be cautious in future dealings with President Trump."
2018-07-11,Breitbart,GOP Sen Tillis 100 Percent Chance Kavanaugh Nomination Confirmed in September,"Wednesday on Hugh Hewitts nationally syndicated radio show, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he anticipated that Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trumps nominee for the vacancy left by the retiring Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, would be confirmed during September.

Should Kavanaugh be confirmed by mid-September, which Tillis said it was a 100 percent chance probability, it would set Kavanaugh up for the beginning of the high courts term in October.

HEWITT: Lets go back to these hearings. At what point do you think Chuck Grassley will simply bring them to a conclusion? We dont want a Clarence Thomas 2.0. We dont want a borking. We want the same respect as was extended to Judges Sotomayor, now Justice Sotomayor, Solicitor General Kagan, now Justice Kagan. Thats what we give them. At what point will Charles Grassley bring down the gavel to stop the abuse of the nominee?

TILLIS: Well, I think it starts with the members of Judiciary on his side of the aisle kind of setting our expectations, and I believe that weve done that. Chuck Grassleys one of the best chairs that Ive had the privilege to work with. And weve made it very clear that we will be respectful of the institution and the process, but we are not going to allow this process to get railroaded. And having a timeline consistent with Sotomayor and with Gorsuch is appropriate, and thats going into this process our expectation. If its just a week, is that a problem? No. If it shifts much beyond that, then I think it becomes a problem.

HEWITT: So you are very confident third or fourth week in August for hearings?

TILLIS: Yeah, I think third or fourth week for the hearings, and then you know, that sets us up for a vote in time to get Judge Kavanaugh seated and have him ready for the next session.

HEWITT: Perhaps by mid-September, because youve got to dive into those briefs. It takes a few days. 30 seconds to you, Senator Tillis. Youve got to give them a couple of weeks to get ready for the term.

TILLIS: Well, thats right. Thats exactly why weve got to pull it forward so that he is ready to be an active member. Hes a brilliant guy. He brings a lot of experience, so I think in a couple of weeks, hell be ready.

HEWITT: Last question. In terms of percentage, whats your level of confidence that Judge Kavanaugh will become Justice Kavanaugh in September?

HEWITT: 100%. Thom Tillis, thats what I wanted to hear. Thank you, my friend."
2018-09-06,Breitbart,Live Updates SCOTUS Confirmation Hearings Brett Kavanaugh Faces Final Round of Questions,"Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates throughout the day. All times eastern.

1:04 PM: Lee asking Kavanaugh about Harris question last night about the Kasowitz firm. He says Harris was a bit ominous when she said Kavanaugh had to be sure in his response. Lee says the firm has offices in nine cities and even Kasowitz probably does not know everyone who works in the firm that he founded. They both realized last night that Sen. Lieberman works at the firm and they did not that beforehand. Kavanaugh says he has not made any promises to anyone about how he would rule on cases that could come before him.

12:59 PM: Lee again goes back to Bookers question last nighthe asked Kavanaugh questions about emails from 18 years ago that Kavanaugh did not even have in front of him. Lee says that these emails deal with issues concerning affirmative action case Adarand. Lee says Kavanaugh was doing what a good lawyer should do in identifying five Supreme Court Justices who would not accept the governments argument (Department of Transportation) in Adarand and offered a remedy. Lee says that Booker should vote for him.

12:53: Durbin and Kavanaugh go back and forth about whether Kavanaugh was involved in some Bush administration programs re: torture and detention. Durbin keeps trying to make the case that Kavanaugh lied to him in 2006 when Kavanaugh has repeatedly said he was not read into those programs.

12:46: Durbin says books are being written about how democracy dies in the age of Trump and he wants reassurances about his views on executive power/importance of democratic institutions in this historical context. Kavanaugh says his record shows his commitment to the independent judiciary as the crown jewel of the republic. He says a foundational principle is that no one is above the law. Kavanaugh says a court order requiring a president to do or not to do something is the final word.

12:36: Durbin again makes it about Trump. He says we have to take Kavanaughs nomination in that context and uses his time to blast Trump for ridiculing the Justice Department and being an un-indicted co-conspirator. He mentions Woodwards book and the anonymous NYT article. He wants to know his views on the authority of the president. Says America hasnt been this riveted by a SCOTUS nomination since Clarence Thomas because of Trumps recent actions/statements. He is grilling Kavanaugh on the unitary executive theory. He says in the age of Trump, this view of presidential power takes on added significance. Durbin gets in a line about Scalia decisis when speaking about Republican lawmakers who feel bound by Scalias dissents re: their opposition to the Mueller investigation.

12:32: Durbin now begins his questioning. He thanks Grassley for the fairness he has shown. Durbin again says protesters of the costs of democracy. He claims he doesnt know who organized the protests.

11:55 AM: Graham asks Kavanaugh if there is anything written in the Constitution about abortion. Kavanaugh says Supreme Court recognized it in 1973 and it has been reaffirmed many times. He keeps pressing Kavanaugh about whether there is any phrase in the Constitution about abortion. Graham says liberty doesnt equate to abortion after Kavanaugh speaks about the liberty clause. Graham wants to know what are the limits on the court re: finding penumbra of rights, etc. He then questions Kavanaugh about whether terrorists will be incentivized to recruit American citizens if Americans cant be held as enemy combatants.

11:48 AM: Graham says circuses are entertaining and you can take children to them. He says these hearings are neither entertaining nor appropriate for children. Graham blast Democrats for playing games and accusing Kavanaugh of stealing emails, etc. and flipping legal concepts upside down. He urges Democrats just to vote no.

11:46 AM: Kavanaugh says he will not comment on a potential case when Leahy asks about whether a gun made by a 3-D printer could be regulated.

11:32 AM: Leahy keeps trying to establish, getting frustrated more and more, that Kavanaugh was not truthful about the stolen emails.

11:05 AM: Hatch commends Kavanaugh for his level-headedness. Hatch says he has never seen the types of interruptions and accuses the left of trying to turn this in to a circus.

11:03 AM: Feinstein now grilling Kavanaugh about Enron and how the fraud and market manipulation contributed to CAs energy crisis. She asks Kavanaugh about talking points he wrote about whether it was up to FERC to stop such conduct. Kavanaugh says FERC would have a role but he is not sure if it should have primary responsibility. Says he was not an expert in those type of cases at the time.

10:58 AM: Feinstein now asking Kavanaugh about the Sea World case in which a killer whale killed a trainer. Kavanaugh says he follows precedent when he ruled that the Labor Department did not have the authority to regulate employers in sporting/entertainment. He says state tort law (NFL concussions) exists to ensure safety. Says he pointed out Labor Dept. could change precedent or Congress could act but he was following precedentDept. traditionally not been thought of as proper body to prohibit punt returns or mandate ear flaps on helmets, etc.

10:55 AM: Feinstein says, We have a president who said he could authorize worse than waterboarding. How would you feel about that? Kavanaugh says he will not comment. Feinstein asks Kavanaugh if Bushs post-9/11 policies re: interrogations were legal. Kavanaugh talks about the need to give sound legal advice and backbone but also says its important for lawyers to tell a president no.

10:53 AM: Kavanaugh mentions that George W. Bush was a pro-life president and says his job was to assist him on policies related to that so some things may have crossed his desk. Feinstein said the Bush White House took steps to limit abortions.

10:41 AM: Grassley now asking Kavanaugh, like Kennedy did last night, about keeping an open mind about cameras in the courtroom. He again says he may be more open to allowing cameras for the announcement of decisions than for oral arguments.

10:35 AM: Grassley finally begins his 20 minutes of questioning and says it is wrong to frame Kavanaugh as someone who does not rule for the little guy. He says Kavanaugh applies the law fairly to all. Agitator interrupts. Grassley gives Kavanaugh to discuss a case in which he rule for a woman who was denied Social Security benefits (hall of mirrors for the woman). He reversed the denial for the woman with mental illness.

10:30 AM: Tillis, who has successfully thrown many jabs at Booker during his remarks, says it took him 17 years to get his college degree after attending five schools, none of which will be elevated to the Ivy League. He says he is not planning to run for president in 2020 or ever. He suggests Senators waive their rights to their documents and suggests they release all of the emails relating to the confirmation process.

10:22 AM: Grassley recognizes Booker and hopes that Booker wont keep saying the same thing. Booker said he violated the rules so the public can know Kavanaughs views on the race. Booker says this is the closest he will have to an I am Spartacus moment. Booker proud that he has violated the rules and keeps mentioning how he knowingly violated the rules over and over again.

10:20 AM: Coons arguing that the documents belong to the American people.

10:18 AM: Lee says if Democrats are frustrated, then they should review the Presidential Records Act.

These documents are not ours, Lee says, adding the public is not entitled to documents that do not belong to them as Democrats have been trying to argue. They belong to someone else.

Lee says he understands that Democrats want to look for a demon and says, in this case, the demon is a law of our own creationthe Presidential Records Act.

10:13 AM: Durbin says count me in if there is going to be retribution against Booker. Hirono says count me in tooshes going to be releasing documents as well.

10:07 AM: Sen. Durbin (D-IL) says, like Sen. Whitehouse (D-RI), his silence should not be interpreted as consent. Durbin spoke after Feinstein said the public is entitled to all of the documents. Durbin claims Bill Burck doesnt have the authority to determine which documents should be marked classified. He then blasts Cornyn for saying Bookers conduct was unbecoming of a Senator.

10:02 AM: Sen. Lee (R-UT), who first called out Booker last night and said Kavanaugh is entitled to see the emails he was being questioned about, says the process is not rigged and has worked.

9:57 AM: Sen. Kennedy (R-LA) says he was trying to be fair to Kavanaugh last night after Booker ambushed him with questions about an email that Kavanaugh did not have a copy of and he says he was trying to be fair to both sides. Sen. Blumenthal (D-CT) now using his time to mention Bob Woodwards book and the New York Times anonymous op-ed to say the breakdown of the process on the Committee is reflective of the chaos in other parts of the government.

9:50 AM: Booker says he will violate rulespenalty is potential ouster from the Senatein an act of civil disobedience and release one of the confidential emails about racial profiling.

I understand the consequences of civil disobedience, Booker said, admitting that he is knowingly violating the rules of the Senate.

9:42 AM: Booker now speaking about the absurdity of the process re: documents. Yesterday, Booker claimed the system was rigged. He now says the process is a bit of sham. Grassley asks was it a sham when we did it for Gorsuch? He asks if it was a sham when Sen. Leahy did it?

9:40 AM: Grassley suggests Democrats all along wanted to play politics with documents. Like Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) did last night, he takes issue with Booker and Democrats for using confidential emails in their questioning.

9:35 AM: Grassley says that even Sen. Feinstein (D-CA) conceded that Kavanaugh was forthcoming in his answers. Feinsteins left-wing challenger Kevin de Leon was less than thrilled:

9:25 AM: Senators now entering the room as the third day of hearings is about to begin. Looks like there will be more protesters. But in a strange way, the protesters have helped Kavanaugh go relatively unscathed. They often interrupt when Democrats on the Committee are trying to build momentum, essentially giving Kavanaugh what can be considered numerous 20-second timeouts to regroup. The agitators have also made the left look terrible to regular Americans."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Sports Betting Odds Site Makes Trump Nearly Even Money to Win Nobel Peace Prize,"According to SBR, it is even money that the two Korean leaders, the Norths Kim Jong-un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in will win a Nobel for the negotiations. While the odds are 6/4 that President Trump will be coupled with one of the other of the Korean leaders.

All on his own, SBR says that the odds of Trump winning a Nobel stands at ten to one.

SBR also threw in a few other possibles. The former President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, was given 12/1 odds of being awarded the coveted prize while the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR) is apparently a 10/1 favorite to win.

SBR is not the only service helping folks make book on a possible Nobel Prize for Trump.

According to The Hill, Ladbrokes increased Trumps chances of winning the prize, either alone or jointly, from 10/1 to 6/4 in the wake of the summit.

For its part, William Hill Betting has the president at 7/4 odds of winning the Nobel in either 2018 or 2019.

It should be remembered that Barack Obama won the prize just for saying he might do some things. Then Obama went on to become the president who bombed more nations than any president since World War Two. So, hes got that going for him. Which is nice."
2018-07-21,Breitbart,World View The Trump-Putin Private Meeting Was Almost Certainly About China,"In an interview broadcast on Friday, President Donald Trump sharply escalated the rhetoric in the trade war with China and threatened to impose tariffs on everything imported from China. China responded to the threat with a vitriolic statement calling Trump a wrecking ball. As I wrote a couple of days ago, the trade war with China will escalate. ( 19-Jul-18 World View  Trump administration signals that trade war with China will escalate sharply)

On Friday, Trump said that to match some of the tariffs China imposes on U.S. products, he has already announced tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese products. He said in the interview (my transcription):

Tariffs on $500 billion would include all products imported from China.

Trump described how this situation began in the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations:

Look Im not doing this for politics. Im doing this to do the right thing for our country. Weve been ripped off by China for a long time. And I told that to president Xi. I said how did this ever happen? And you know what happened? And you know what their answer is? because I deal with the highest echelons of china. One of the great people of China said, There was never anybody that talked to us in the United States. We would put on a trade barrier, where you couldnt sell cars, or you couldnt sell beef, or you couldnt sell your farm products, nobody would talk to us in the United States. So we said thats great. Then we put on another one. Wed put on a tariff on cars, 25%, and you charge us virtually nothing 2 1/2 per cent, but they dont pay it. So we would do this, and nobody would talk. Wed start off at a lower number, wed raise it, wed raise it, nobody would every complain, until you came along. Me. And they said, Now youre doing more than complaining, we dont like what youre doing. They think maybe were doing too much.

It is widely believed that we are on the verge of a full-blown trade war with China, which was already clear from my article two days ago. CNBC and New York Magazine and Guardian (London)

Chinas Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hua Chunying gave her regular press conference on Friday, and said the following in response to a question about trade:

Third, everyone is watching when the US side behaves like this in international relations, and everyone is hearing and seeing what the US officials are saying and doing. So, we all know what the whole world thinks of the US. It is quite obvious that some people in the US are so obsessed with their conjured-up reality that they simply cannot be waken up. However, by brandishing its wanton and striking indiscriminately while depriving others right to self-defense, by blocking its own door while demanding others to unconditionally open theirs wider, by overriding others interests and the international rules to serve its own political needs and selfish interests, the US has really taught us something in a piercing and profound way. I have noted that many US citizens and its allies have spoken out unreservedly. The US is now the biggest wrecking ball to world stability and certainty. Its unilateralism and protectionism pose the greatest threat to the international rules and the world economic order. I said the other day that knowing someone is intelligence but knowing oneself is real wisdom. Today I want to add that nothing could be more disastrous than chaos. As the No.1 power in todays world, the US should at least think about its responsibility before making relevant policies or saying or doing anything, because it is the order of the world that they are expected to promote, not chaos.

I believe that the reference to depriving others right to self-defense refers to Americas freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, where Chinas activities were declared illegal in 2016 by the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague, which ruled that all of Chinas activities in the South China Sea are illegal and in violation of international law. With regard to promoting chaos, the Chinese must be aware that they have infuriated all their neighbors by their illegal activities.

Chinas appeal to international law is laughable, because China only cares about international law when it favors them. When it does not favor them, as in the case of the South China Sea, they claim that they are superior to everyone else, and their law supersedes international law. The same is true in trade. China has repeatedly violated and ignored World Trade Organization rules, but they complain about international law to gain an advantage.

In an interview Friday, Trumps chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested that China will retaliate against individual American companies doing business in China:

China could target individual American companies through new regulations.

Trump is not going to back down. And, based on the vitriolic intensity of Hua Chunyings statement, China is not going to back down either.

As I wrote in my recent article, from the point of view of Generational Dynamics, the U.S. and China are in a generational Crisis era, in a tit-for-tat escalation sequence that leads to a full-blown generational crisis war. It is clear from remarks by Trump, Hua, and Kudlow that that is exactly where we are headed. Foreign Ministry of China and Axios

Donald Trump and Russias president Vladimir Putin had a private one-on-one meeting during their July 16 summit meeting in Helsinki. As usual, the mainstream media, who have absolutely no clue what is going on in the world, have been screaming hysterically, some suggesting that Trump should be tried and convicted of treason, and then executed. Others demanded that the American interpreter who sat in on the meeting should be subpoenaed and forced to testify, something that would trigger enormous international diplomatic issues.

Trump tweeted on Thursday that he would like to schedule a second meeting with Putin in the fall, this time in Washington. This drew further hysterical screaming, along with demands that no such meeting be permitted unless Trump fully describes what happened in the first meeting.

In his CNBC interview on Friday, Trump gave a brief description of his summit meeting with Putin:

As I wrote in my previous article, Trump is very well aware that we are headed for a world war against China. From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this war cannot be prevented. Trump is taking whatever steps he can to prevent this war, and I am not going to criticize Trump for taking steps to prevent a world war, even if the war cannot be prevented.

Vladimir Putin is also well aware that Russia is headed for a war with China. The Russian and Chinese people have been in conflict for centuries, especially since Russia, after conquest by Genghis Khan, became a vassal state of the China and the Mongol Empire for centuries. ( 31-Mar-18 World View  Russias Far East, Siberia and Vladivostok under threat from China)

So today, both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are aware that their countries are going to be allies in world war launched by China.

When they had their private summit meeting on July 16, it is inconceivable that they did not discuss this oncoming war, and how they would defend themselves and help defend each other.

That also explains why there is so much secrecy about the meeting. Any mention that Trump and Putin discussed plans for a world war launched by China would cause a massive international uproar. So the subject of the private meeting must be kept secret. But with so much at stake for the United States, Russia, and the rest of the world, it is inconceivable that they did not discuss this subject when they had the chance. And it will be all to the good for them to have another meeting in the fall, for further discussions on this subject. The Hill

As I have been writing for many months, there is absolutely no possibility whatsoever that North Korea is going to denuclearize, either now or in the future.

On Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley criticized both China and Russia for helping North Korea violate United Nations sanctions as the regime smuggles in more oil than is allowed.

According to Pompeo, When sanctions are not enforced, the prospects for the successful denuclearization of North Korea are diminished.

It has been nearly six weeks after President Trumps summit with Kim Jong-un, and there are no signs whatsoever, that the North Koreans have any intention of denuclearizing. ABC News

2018-07-22,Breitbart,Dem Rep Moulton on Pelosi Dems Need a New Generation of Leadership,"Sunday on CNNs State of the Union, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) said while he is not planning to challenge House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for party leadership, the Democratic Party needs a new generation of leadership.

Moulton said, This is bigger than one person. What we need is a new generation of leadership, to be honest about the problems we face. A lot of Americans are hurting. A lot of Americans are working two or three jobs to make ends meat. We need a leader who will talk about the future and not bring us back to the past, to be honest about the fact that a lot of Americans are losing jobs, not to immigrants but automation, be willing to be strong on national security, to create a country thats strong and safe. Someone whos willing to reform government and someone who has a vision for the future. We need an uniter in our party. We can continue to have these narrow and divisive politics with our current leaders, or we can find leaders who are going to really bring us together.

He added, Ive said very clearly Im not challenging leader Pelosi. But I am going to talk about the kind of leadership we need."
2018-07-03,Breitbart,White House Dedicates Staff to SCOTUS Selection and Confirmation,"White House Counsel Don McGahn and the Counsels Office will oversee the process of selection and confirmation of a SCOTUS nominee.

White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah will oversee communications, strategy and messaging coordination with Capitol Hill allies, according to Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. Shah will be taking leave from his press position to be completely dedicated to the Supreme Court nomination.

Director of the Office of Public Liaison Justin Clark will oversee White House outreach with key constituencies, coalitions, grassroots organizations and allies, according to Sanders.

White House and Trump administration personnel within the Eisenhower Executive Office Building will be working on the project. Teams of attorneys from the White House Counsels Office and Department of Justice are working to ensure the President has all the information he needs to choose his nominee, according to Sanders.

The Department of Justice is fully engaged to support the nomination and confirmation efforts, the press secretary assured.

President Donald Trump will announce his choice for the Supreme Court seat on Monday, July 9. He is expected to choose one of seven potential nominees named on his previously compiled list of 25 candidates."
2018-07-20,Breitbart,Netflix Host Michelle Wolf Likens ICE to Murderous Terrorists,"Wolf, fresh from attacking White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders at this years White House Correspondents Dinner, not-so-subtlety satirized the Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by criticizing it as an extremist group.

 Are you worried about your country? Do you feel like your land is being invaded by foreign intruders? Is your way of life under attack and are you ready to do something? a voiceover intones as the bit begins.

The two-minute skit continues as the characters repeatedly say ICE and the word is together as if they are slyly saying ISIS, the name of the brutal Islamist terror network.

One agent says: I wanted to join the regular police, but they wouldnt take someone who was already under arrest. Interjects Wolf/Nielsen: And we love that! Join us today and you too can tell your ICE IS story. ICE IS waging a war for everything that is holy in this country, boasts one recruit, adding, I guess you could call it a Holy War. ICE IS guaranteeing my ticket to heaven, adds another, parroting an ISIS pitch.

Take it from me; no organization is better than ICE IS, Wolfs Nielsen says.

The skit comes on the heels of liberals insisting that President Donald Trump is anti-American for criticizing federal police and intelligence agencies  but also comes as a growing number of Democrats are calling for the dismantling of the immigration department and for implementing an end to immigration laws thereby creating an open border.

Wolf recently caused controversy last week singing God Bless Abortion in an Independence Day musical bit on her Netflix comedy show."
2018-07-08,Breitbart,No Joke Univision Cutting 15 of The Onions Staff,"According to The Daily Beast, Univision plans to negotiate buyout packages with the aforementioned sites editorial union later this month.

The Onion was founded in 1988 in Madison, Wisc., by two university students and distributed as a print weekly, which grew into multiple markets, reaching a circulation as high as 500,000 copies, and then gradually shrunk until the print edition was canceled in 2013. The phrase not the Onion has become commonplace in an era in which political and social norms are in upheaval.

Univision purchased a 40% controlling stake in Onion Inc. in January of 2016, seeking to appeal to millennials who heavily consume news media content via mobile phones.

Univision laid off over 40 staffers from Gizmodo Media  formerly known as Gawker Media  in late June. In May, Gizmodo Media attacked its parent company as a f*cking mess in an editorial. 

 

 Gizmodo Media includes websites such as Deadspin, Jezebel, and The Root.

Univision also laid off staffers from its English-language television channel Fusion and its own news media websites."
2018-08-01,Breitbart,Democrats Impeachment Army 110 Million 1000 Staff 2000 Volunteers,"Steyers organizations, NextGen America and Need to Impeach, will also have a combined 1,000 employees and 2,000 staffers as they take the case for impeachment to voters in November, according to Politico. Though House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has discouraged impeachment talk, grass roots Democrats favor the idea.

Tom Steyer plans to spend at least $110 million in 2018, making the billionaire investor the largest single source of campaign cash on the left and placing him on a path to create a parallel party infrastructure with polling, analytics and staffing capabilities that stand to shape and define the issues the party runs on in November. Steyer is building out an operation thats bigger than anyones other than the Koch brothers  and the billionaire and his aides believe the reservoir of nontraditional voters hes already activated could become the overriding factor in House and other races across the country. Between the two organizations, hell have close to 1,000 people on staff, in addition to over 2,000 volunteers. The Need to Impeach email list alone has already topped 5.5 million, which its research  anyone who signs up with the effort has their information run through a series of voter files and other databases  shows includes a very exact 697,780 infrequent voters in the 63 most competitive House districts. Our list is bigger than the NRAs  and were going to make sure that it votes that way in 2018, said Kevin Mack, lead strategist for Need to Impeach.

Steyer claimed earlier this year that Democrats must embrace impeachment if they want to win the midterm elections and return to power. Politico adds that Steyers internal polls show that Republican voters are not yet motivated by the desire to prevent Trump from being impeached  which has been a major fear of the Democratic Party establishment, which has tried to suppress the idea.

Steyer, who has already spent tens of millions of dollars on pro-impeachment advertising, will hope for a better return on his investments than he experienced in 2014, when he spent roughly $75 million, only to see Republicans take the Senate.

2018-02-10,Breitbart,Budget Includes Win for Religious Liberty FEMA Aid Available to Faith-Based Institutions,"One provision of the budget ends discrimination against churches, mosques, temples, synagogues, and other houses of worship by banning them from receiving federal aid after a natural disaster through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)   a policy put in place by the Barack Obama administration.

Banning religious institutions from receiving federal aid following a flood, hurricane, or other natural disaster also hampers such institutions from their mission of helping disaster victims generally.

Following the devastation of Hurricane Harvey in August, First Liberty Institute, a legal group working to preserve religious liberty, represented Trinity Church, Church on the Rock Katy and Grace Community Church (Clients) in the Houston area, which were suffering from the devastating impact of the hurricane. First Liberty wrote a letter to President Donald Trump asking him to rescind the policy.

The letter said, in part:

These entities withstood displacement, human suffering, and millions of dollars in flood damage. And, like the neighborhoods and communities they serve, they need immediate aid and relief. However, under the Federal Emergency Management Agencys (FEMA) Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide (PA Policy Guide), churches and other religious organizations, including our clients, are ineligible for disaster relief simply because they are churches. President Trump may be the only means by which churches and religious organizations in Texas and Florida obtain the disaster relief they so urgently need. The PA Policy is not new, and has been re-issued under previous administrations, including two revisions under President Obamas FEMA Assistant Administrator. But President Trump has publicly declared that churches and religious organizations should be entitled to disaster relief on equal terms as non-religious organizations. And with the stroke of a pen, the Trump Administration can make this a reality, providing much-needed disaster relief to hundreds of religious organizationswho themselves continue to provide relief to tens of thousands of affected citizens throughout Texas and Florida. On behalf of our clients, First Liberty Institute requests the Trump administration immediately rescind the unconstitutional religious ban; specify that churches and religious nonprofit organizations, including our Clients, are eligible to apply for and receive Public Assistance on the same terms as their non-religious neighbors.

In January, Trump announced his administration would end the religious ban and allow religious entities to apply for FEMA relief, consistent with federal law, according to First Liberty.

Todays announcement by the White House allows our clients to continue to be the bedrocks of their hurricane-ravaged communities, Chelsey Youman, Counsel for First Liberty, said of the decision.

Thanks to the Trump administration, thousands of houses of worship are again eligible for FEMA relief just like everyone else and can start the process of rebuilding, Youman said.

And now, the 2018 budget act makes the new FEMA policy law.

Its a great victory for equal protection and treatment of churches as valuable institutions as well as providers of critical services to the community in times of need, Dave Welch, executive director of the Houston Area Pastor Council, said."
2018-07-11,Breitbart,Smartphone Handgun in Production Shipping to Dealers,"On March 20, 2016, Breitbart News reported that Kirk Kjellberg created a handgun that looks like a cell phone. The main difference between the handgun and a smartphone is that the former fires two rounds for self-defense while the latter only allows you to dial 911 after you have been attacked and need first responders.

Kjellberg explained that his motivation for making the gun was to give Americans a way to carry their self-defense tool discreetly. He told WHDH, When a little child, a boy about 7, saw me and said, Mommy, mommy that guys got a gun, and that whole restaurant of course turns and stares at you, and I thought theres just gotta be something better to do than this.

He said his decision to use a smartphone design grew out of his desire to allow people to carry without having to engage other people about why theyre carrying that gun.

The Ideal Conceal smartphone guns holds two rounds of .380 auto, and part of the gun folds out to make a grip in the event that the gun is needed in a self-defense situation.

Kjellbergs smartphone gun is now shipping to dealers around the country.

There is already a holster for the Ideal Conceal smartphone handgun on the market. The holster is designed in a way that contributes to the guns appearance as a smartphone.

2018-06-16,Breitbart,Muslim Activist Who Beat Policeman at Tommy Robinson Rally Spared Prison Robinson Still Locked Up,"Omar Mohamad had chosen to travel all the way from Reading to protest a free speech event led by Robinson at Speakers Corner in Hyde Park, held to express views that were adverse to the Muslim community in the United Kingdom  according to District Judge Richard Blake.

We live in a democracy  people should feel free, within limits, to express their opinions, he opined.

You were with a group of other men. It is fair to say that immediately in front of you there was a fracas.

You joined into the melee that happened and you joined in with your stick.

While you do need that stick to walk with, you very much used it by wielding it around as a weapon. You brought the stick round and struck [Police Sergeant Guy Rooney] in the face.

There is no doubt that this was a very significant injury that you caused with your stick.

Sergeant Rooney had told the court how the attack had left his face so badly damaged that his children would not walk to school with him, and claimed he had been left with post-traumatic stress.

Nevertheless, despite the violent nature of Mohamads attack and his decision to claim he was acting in self-defence and plead not guilty, the judge appeared to buy the picture painted by the defence of a sickly man with multiple illnesses, who had shown genuine remorse.

Youre a man of sixty-two and of good character, the judge said  a sightly curious assessment, given Mohamad just been convicted for assaulting causing actual bodily harm against an on-duty police officer.

He then handed down a six-month sentence, but suspended it so Mohammed was able to walk free without actually having to serve any time in prison, unless he reoffends.

Robinson, meanwhile, is currently serving two terms totalling 13 months  which, unusually, are to be served consecutively rather than concurrently  for non-violent contempt of court convictions, imposed for reporting on grooming gang trials in Canterbury and Leeds."
2018-11-23,Breitbart,Xi Jinping to Tour Central America in Bid to Expand Chinas Influence,"Xi will meet with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela on December 3rd, where the two leaders are scheduled to sign over two dozen agreements on sectors including science, technology, commerce, and infrastructure.

The visit will follow the highly anticipated meeting between Xi and President Donald Trump at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, scheduled to take place on November 30 and December 1, where the two sides will seek to calm tensions over the ongoing trade war and compete for geopolitical influence.

Chinas decision to strengthen diplomatic ties comes after Panamas government announced last year that it would abandon its allegiance to Taiwan and support the one-China principle, which does not recognize Taiwan as an independent country.

 Located in Central America and bordering Costa Rica and Colombia, Panama is widely considered an area of strategic importance to U.S. influence across the Western Hemisphere, with the 82km (51 miles) Panama Canal linking the Pacific and Atlantic oceans together.

In recent weeks, China has also hosted leaders from the Dominican Republic and El Salvador with the promise of increased investment and generous aid packages after both countries also announced they would cut diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of supporting the one-China principle.

Chinas increasing involvement in Central America is likely to cause further concern in Washington, as the worlds two largest economies battle it out for the geopolitical influence of the region. In China, the number of university students studying Spanish and Portuguese has exploded in recent years, indicating a fast-growing interest in the region.

Beijing has long considered the continent full of opportunities to expand its own influence, mainly by using its economic and financial power to forge predatory relationships with some of the continents most impoverished nations and ideologically sympathetic governments.

Last week, Vice President Mike Pence warned smaller countries not to be seduced by Chinas promises of economic security, arguing that such packages lead to countries experiencing serious debt problems from accepting loans that are not transparent.

Francisco Luis Perez, a Latin America studies expert at Taiwans Tamkang University, told the South China Morning Post that Panama may be less willing to bow down to China because of fears of damaging their relationship with the U.S.

Following the stern warnings from the United States, Xis trip keeps on being a potential bargaining chip to get things from the US, but it also constitutes a serious risk of creating tensions with a geographically close power, Perez said. I do not expect Panama to risk and make strategic or political pacts with China during the trip, but instead to focus on economic issues without much military or strategic impact."
2018-07-12,Breitbart,Peter Strzok Ive Never Been Biased in Any Case Never Recused Myself,"REP. RAUL LABRADOR (R-ID): Has there ever been a time when your professional actions or you believe you had bias where you needed to move on from an investigation at any time?

LABRADOR: No Has there been a time in your career that you recused yourself from a professional action?

LABRADOR: Okay, youll be surprised that I actually believe that the Russians tried to destabilize our economy, our way of life, our government. I think they have been doing it for a long time. Im curious if this is the first time that Russia tried to interfere with an American election?

STRZOK: Im aware of times where they  going back to the sixties and seventies where they planted evidence seeking to introduce items of information that were false in newspapers  Im not aware of any direct outreach to members of a presidential candidate or his immediate team.

LABRADOR: Did they attempt to interfere in the 2012 elections?

STRZOK: I am certain they did, yes."
2018-11-11,Breitbart,Brian Kemp Camp Rips Stacey Abrams for Refusing to Concede A Disgrace to Democracy,"Stacey Abrams antics are a disgrace to democracy and completely ignore the will of the people, campaign communications director Ryan Mahoney said in a statement. Georgia voters have spoken. Its time for Abrams to listen and concede immediately.

This is not how America works. Brian Kemp earned a clear victory on Tuesday night and holds a sizable lead as remaining provisional and military ballots are counted, the statement continued. Further, Kemps camp said it is currently mathematically impossible for Abrams to force a runoff or win.

With 100 percent of precincts tallied, the Republican leads Abrams by 62,709 votes. Despite Kemps sizeable lead, Abrams refuses to concede until every ballot is accounted for. Abrams camp claims there is no reason to give up on the race just yet, arguing the outstanding total of untallied votes could trigger a runoff election. Said election would take place on December 4.

In response to Kemps criticism, the Democrat candidate posted a statement to Instagram, saying she is refusing to throw in the towel because she is fighting to make sure our democracy works.

I am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it, Abrams wrote. I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count.

Make no mistake: Our democracy should work for all of us, regardless of political leanings, race, income, or region. Voting is a right, not a privilege, she continued. It is fundamental to our democracy and to our Georgia, and I will fight every single day until our government  a government of the people, by the people, and for the people  works for all of us."
2018-07-09,Breitbart,Dershowitz If I Were Defending Clinton Id Be the Hero of Marthas Vineyard,"Sunday on MSNBCs Kasie DC, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz took aim at the hypocrites at Marthas Vineyard who are upset and threatening violence because he has defended President Donald Trump, saying if he were defending Hillary Clinton in this same situation, he would be the hero of the vineyard.

Look, hypothetically, if Hillary Clinton had been elected, which I was hoping  I contributed, I worked hard for her  if she were being subject to impeachment and investigation, Id be making the same arguments and Id be the hero of the vineyard. The very same arguments Ive been making, people would be applauding me and cheering me and loving me. These are hypocrites who dont understand that you make the same arguments no matter who the person is."
2018-07-06,Breitbart,WATCH Congolese Statue of Liberty Climber Inspired by Michelle Obama,"Michelle Obama ... said when they go low, we go high. And I went as high as I could, Statue of Liberty climber Therese Patricia Okoumou told reporters outside Manhattan Federal Courthouse Thursday.

Okoumou, who came to the United States in 1994 from the Democratic Republic of Congo, pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor trespassing and disorderly conduct Thursday before a judge released her on her own recognizance.

After emerging from the courthouse, Okoumou took the opportunity to bash the president and his zero-tolerance policy on immigration.

Trump has ripped this country apart. It is depressing. It is outrageous, she said. His Draconian zero-tolerance policy on immigration has to go.

Despite some left-wing activists hailing her climb as an act of resistance, law enforcement officers and prosecutors said that her stunt endangered her life and the lives of others.

(This) alarmed the public and endangered her own life and the lives of the NYPD officers who responded to the scene, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said. While we must and do respect the rights of the people to peaceably protest, that right does not extend to breaking the law in ways that put others at risk.

NYPD Detective Brian Glacken said that Okoumou was initially hostile towards the officers trying to rescue her, threatening to kick down the ladder the officers were standing on.

She basically threatened to push us off, push the ladder off. But we were persistent, stayed up there, Glacken told reporters.

The left-wing activist group Rise and Resist released a statement in part about Okoumous climb, stating that her decision to scale the statue was her own and not representative of the group:

The person who climbed the Statue of Liberty was one of forty participants in our planned banner action, but her decision to climb the statue was made independently of the group, without consulting any other member of the group. We understand and share her desire to see the immediate release of children from detention and reunion with their parents. We hope that her legal representation will arrange for her release under her own recognizance.

Okoumou is due back in court for a status conference on August 3. If convicted on both charges, she faces up to a year behind bars."
2018-06-19,Breitbart,Kamala Harris Separating Families Unconscionable Not Reflective of Who We Are,"Monday on MSNBCs The Beat, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) called for Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to resign over the administrations unconscionable immigration policies.

Harris said those actions were not reflective of who we are as a country.

Harris said, They need to end this policy. It is unconscionable, it is immoral, it is wrong, and it is unnecessary. I think there is no question that it has become very evident to many many people who have been watching the images that this it is not reflective of who we are as a country. It has got to stop. Full stop. It has got to stop.

On Nielsen, Harris said, I think she should resign. I think she is not equippedbased on her conduct, based on the procedures and policies she is promulgating. I dont think she is equipped to do the job the way that it needs to be done, which is that there should be values that are at play that are consistent with who we say we are as Americans. The government should be in the business of keeping families together, not tearing families apart, not tearing children from their parents."
2018-07-25,Breitbart,Ga State Rep Resigns After Shouting N-Word on Sacha Baron Cohen Show,"Rep. Jason Spencer had vowed to serve out his term despite the fallout. Now hell step down at months end, spokesman Kaleb McMichen told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution late Tuesday.

In Sunday nights broadcast of Cohens Showtime series Who Is America? Cohen poses as an Israeli military expert who persuades Spencer to take part in several outlandish exercises. The lawmaker is told theyre making a counterterrorism video.

Spencer repeatedly shouts a racial slur for black people after Cohen tells him the tactic is useful for drawing bystanders attention to an unfolding attack.

He also drops his pants, then his underwear, before backing his exposed rear end toward Cohen while shouting USA! and America! Cohen told Spencer this would incite fear in homophobic jihadists. The segment also shows Spencer speaking with a mock Asian accent while using a selfie-stick to surreptitiously insert a camera phone between the legs of a woman dressed in traditional Muslim clothing.

Ralston and others had called for his immediate resignation.

In a statement Monday, Spencer apologized for the ridiculously ugly episode, but he initially refused to step down.

Spencer lost the Republican primary in May, but he could have remained in public office through the November election."
2018-09-05,Breitbart,Police Man Intentionally Rammed Truck into Local Fox Station KDFW,"In what is being described as a scary moment, police scrambled to the 400 block of N. Griffin Street at around 6:15 a.m after receiving a call regarding the crash. The driver of the Dodge Ram is in police custody, reports say. A man crashed a truck into the side of our building this morning. He jumped out and started ranting. tweeted Fox 4. He left behind a suspicious bag. Most have been evacuated & a few are working to keep the news on air from a secure location.

No injuries have been reported at this time, police told Fox 4.

The Dallas bomb squad is currently investigating a suspicious package  a black and orange gym bag  at the scene.

Fox 4 reporter Brandon Todd shared a photo of the suspect pressing an illegible piece of paper up against the stations window. This was the man who smashed his truck into our station this morning..throwing papers around while yelling high treason, tweeted Todd.

A Fox 4 photojournalist reports the suspect threw hundreds of pages of paper with his writings, out of the Dodge Ram after crashing into the station.

Comedian David Adkins, better known by his stage name Sinbad, shared a photo of a paper left behind by the suspect. Printed on the paper was a WFAA.com report titled Driver shot by Denton County deputy during a traffic stop dies. Hard to get in the bldg because a fool rammed the bldg twice with his truck and police have shut down the street, the actor tweeted.  The phrase high treason, was written at the top of the piece of paper.

According to reporter Tiffany Liou, a Fox 4 staffer said the driver crashed into the building twice and began screaming about treason, after he exited the vehicle.

Law enforcement has closed off streets surrounding the Fox 4 station and evacuated a majority of its personnel.

Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) spokesperson Mark Ball said train service in the downtown area was suspended in response to the incident. The city will provide shuttle buses for commuters."
2018-07-20,Breitbart,Scottish University Fires Catholic Chaplain for Opposing Gay Pride,"Fr. Mark Morris conducted a rosary, litany, and benediction at Immaculate Heart of Mary Church on Monday night to atone for the gross offence to God of Glasgow Pride and the next day Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) announced that his work as Catholic chaplain was terminated because his views conflicted with those of the educational institution.

Following due consultation Father Mark Morris will not return to his chaplaincy role at the university in September, said Professor Pamela Gillies, principal and vice-chancellor of GCU, a public university of some 16,000 students.

The university will work with the Archdiocese of Glasgow to ensure the continued provision of chaplaincy support for staff and students at our Faith and Belief Centre when the new term starts, Gillies said.

Ms. Gillies did not say whether opposition to homosexual sex was the only area of Catholic teaching that the university found to be intolerable.

Glasgows Gay Pride parade took place last Saturday and was attended by Scotlands First Minister Nicola Sturgeon who served as grand marshal of the event.

In a lengthy Facebook post, Glasgow Caledonians Catholic Community defended Father Morris, claiming that the priests actions were completely in line with Catholic Church teaching.

Saying it was extremely disappointed at the decision, the Catholic society called it frankly abhorrent for a Catholic Priest to be dismissed from his post as a Catholic chaplain for merely reaffirming the teachings of the Catholic faith.

Because of Catholic teaching on human sexuality it would be expected that the Church would not align herself with a movement like Pride, which promotes sexual promiscuity and celebrates extra-marital actions which are considered gravely sinful, the group said.

The GCU Catholic community also took issue with the universitys skewed understanding of equality and diversity shown in its decision to openly oppose a Catholic presence that affirms church teaching on sexuality.



Principal Gilles justified sacking the chaplain on the grounds that GCU is strongly inclusive and committed to supporting equality and diversity on campus, an affirmation that the Catholic community found puzzling.

It seems that Glasgow Caledonian University have a very warped understanding of Equality and Diversity, whereby they have permitted absolutely no diversity of opinion whatsoever, the group said. We are very sad to see that the opinions and beliefs of Catholics are not valued or respected at the university chaplaincy.

On a personal level, the GCU Catholic society said that Father Morris has been a beloved member of the university community.

Anyone who knows Fr. Morris will know he is a gentle giant, and is very careful to be truthful but also charitable, the post stated. He is well-loved by the students and spends a lot of time with the homeless, providing them with meals and a listening ear.

In all charity, we would urge the university to reconsider this unfair dismissal of our chaplain, it said.

In its own brief statement, the Archdiocese of Glasgow said it was aware of the Universitys decision and will address the provision of chaplaincy support in due course."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,Flashback President Obama Promised No Political Influence in FBI Investigations Period Full Sto,"I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department, or the FBI, not just in this case, but in any case, Obama said. Full stop. Period.

Obama made his comment in an interview with Fox News reporter Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday.

Obama was referring to the FBI investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her private email server, but he went a step further.

Obamas promise has been revisited, now that evidence exists that the FBI investigation of President Donald Trump and his campaign may have been politically influenced.

POTUS wants to know everything were doing a text between FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page read in September 2016 as former FBI Director James Comey prepared a briefing on the email investigation case. The new texts raise questions about Obamas involvement, despite his claim in April that there was no political influence."
2018-07-11,Breitbart,Fusion GPSs Glenn Simpson Denied Talking to FBI Peter Strzok Email Says Otherwise,"FBI memos that are now being turned over to Congress include an email written by FBI agent Peter Strzok that shows the FBI received a version of the dossier from Simpson, before it was published online by BuzzFeed in January 2017.

Our internal system is blocking the site, Strzok wrote of the copy of the dossier published by BuzzFeed. I have the PDF via iPhone but its 25.6MB. Comparing now. The set is only identical to what McCain had. (it has differences from what was given to us by Corn and Simpson.).

The Hills John Solomon first reported on Strzoks email, which was sent around the time BuzzFeed published a copy of the dossier on January 10, 2017.

However, Simpson had denied twice last year to House and Senate investigators that he had ever communicated with the FBI about the dossier or provided them with a copy of it.

Senate Judiciary Committee investigators asked Simpson during closed-door testimony last year, Mr. Simpson, did anyone from Fusion ever communicate with the FBI regarding information in the memoranda or other allegations regarding Mr. Trump, and his associates?

Simpson responded, No, no one from Fusion ever spoke with the FBI, to the best of my knowledge.

He also said he was unaware of any version of the dossier being given to the FBI. I dont know that there was a version provided to the FBI, he said.

Simpson also denied to House investigators he ever approached the FBI with information in the dossier.

A House investigator asked Simpson: Did you at any time approach the FBI directly regarding this information or your findings?

It is unclear whether Strzok misstated Simpson as a source for the dossier, or whether Simpson misled Congress.

Strzoks email also shows some of the multiple channels through which the dossier was being fed to the FBI.

Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has admitted to meeting an associate of Christopher Steele  the ex-British spy hired by Fusion GPS to work on the dossier  in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in December 2016, and arranging for his associate, David Kramer, to travel to London to obtain a copy of the dossier to give to the then-FBI Director James Comey.

How Buzzfeed obtained an actual copy of the dossier is unknown, but Strzoks email revealed that it was the same version as the one given McCain. Buzzfeeds set is only identical to what McCain had, Strzok wrote.

The Corn that Simpson was referring to is Mother Jones reporter David Corn. Although Corn never published the dossier, he wrote an article on Oct. 31, 2016, entitled, A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump. He told The Hill he sent the dossier to the FBI after the election, hoping to obtain some verification of it from the FBI.

There could have also been other channels used to pass on the dossiers findings to the FBI.

CIA Director John Brennan reportedly briefed during the summer of 2016 then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), who then wrote a letter to Comey asking him to investigate them. The Hills Solomon wrote:

The significance of Strzoks email is obvious to investigators who reviewed it in recent days. The FBI is supposed to be immune to manipulation by circular information flows, especially with sensitive investigations such as evaluating whether a foreign power tampered with an American election. Yet, in this case, the generally same information kept walking through the FBIs door for months  recycled each time by a new character with ties to Hillary Clinton or hatred for Trump  until someone decided they had to act.

As an investigator told Solomon: The dossier and its related dirt was on a circular flight path aboard a courier service called Air Clinton, and the FBI kept signing for the packages.

Its all the sort of recycling that, in another context, might make an environmentalist happy. But its exactly the sort of circular intelligence-gathering and political pressure that the FBI is supposed to reject, Solomon wrote.

The FBI would later use the dossier, as well as a Yahoo News report based on the dossiers findings, to justify obtaining a surveillance warrant on  former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page in October 2016, right before the election. The dossier made an unverified claim that Page had met with two senior Russian officials during a publicized trip in July 2016.

The House Intelligence Committee is investigating how the dossier was used by Justice Department and FBI officials during its investigation of the Trump campaign and any potential abuses."
2018-07-23,Breitbart,Sacha Baron Cohen Targets Dick Cheney Ted Koppel in Latest Who Is America,"In one scene, Baron-Cohen poses as an Israeli anti-terror expert, Colonel Erran Morad, who meets with Dick Cheney and asks that the former vice president sign a waterboarding kit. Morad also asks Cheney which of the wars he started was his favorite.

Elsewhere, former Nightline anchor Ted Koppel sat down with Cohen persona Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Ph.D., a conspiracy theorist character. The interview ended swiftly after Ruddick refused to accept basic concepts, such as the setting of the sun.

However, Koppel has admitted he enjoyed watching the pranks.

Everybody loves seeing well-known people get duped, Koppel told the Hollywood Reporter. I relish it too, when its done well.

In another segment, Cohen again poses as Morad who has enlisted Georgias Republican state representative Jason Spencer for a tutorial on self-defense. In the video, Spencer is taught a number of techniques that include dropping his pants to scare Islamic State terrorists and even screaming the N-word as a form of intimidation.

In a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution before the segment aired, Spencer claimed that Cohen had fraudulently induced me in participating in bogus self-defense and anti-terrorism training, and that he was told the video was intended to be an educational aid to train elected officials who may be targeted by terrorists.

They exploited my state of mind for profit and notoriety. This media companys deceptive and fraudulent behavior is exactly why President Donald Trump was elected. Furthermore, there are sensitive parts of this training that took place under a kidnapping scenario where I was repeatedly asked to shout provocative language which I requested be removed, but I was not afforded that opportunity to have final approval over footage used that was initially extended to me by the filmmakers. It is clear the makers of this film intended to deceive me in an attempt to undermine the American conservative political movement; therefore, I have sought legal counsel to challenge this illegal and unethical behavior and plan on taking action if and when any of this fraudulently obtained footage of me is used by these Hollywood liberals to line their own pockets.

The show has sharply divided opinion since its premiere earlier this month, with other prominent victims including Bernie Sanders and Sarah Palin. The shows premiere attracted a disappointing audience of just 327,000 viewers, with many critics pointing to its repetitive and predictable humor."
2018-11-22,Breitbart,Trump Gives Jim Mattis Authority to Broaden Troop Border Activities,"Those activities include a show or use of force (including lethal force, where necessary), crowd control, temporary detention, and cursory search, according to the memo, which was signed on Tuesday by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.

Department of Defense personnel shall not, without further direction from the President, conduct traditional civilian law enforcement activities, such as arrest, search, and seizure in connection with the enforcement of the laws, it added.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said despite the new authorization, the current missions have not yet changed and that troops remain unarmed except for those whose specific job is to protect other deployed troops.

There has been no call for any lethal force from [the Department of Homeland Security], he told reporters Wednesday. We dont have guns in their hands right now other than a couple of [non-commissioned officers] who at any point ... are armed for force protection.

So there is no armed element going in ... I will determine it based upon what DHS asks for, and a mission analysis, and when we do that, well let you know what it is, he said.

He rejected that the new authorities are in violation of Posse Comitatus, the law that prohibits federal troops from performing law enforcement duties within the United States.

The one point I want to make is, again, we are not doing law enforcement. We do not have arrest authority, he said.

He said crowd control would consist of putting up Jersey barriers, and detention would be in terms of minutes.

In other words, if someones beating on a border patrolman, and if we were in position to do something about it, we could stop them from beating on him, and take him over and deliver him over to a border patrolman who would then arrest him for it, he said.

Mattis said any new mission would depend on what the DHS needs and requests and that he would brief the press if there are any new missions. Were in support of DHS and the commissioner of Customs Border Protection, he said.

The memo also said that Mattis could determine the duration of this deployment but shall consult with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security prior to withdrawing troops.

The new authority comes amid reports of several thousands of Central American migrants now in Tijuana, Mexico, who were allegedly planning to overrun the border into California.

The memo said, credible evidence and intelligence indicate the caravans may prompt incidents of violence and disorder that could threaten U.S. Customs and Border personnel and other United States government personnel performing the Federal functions necessary to secure and protect the integrity of the southern border.

In light of this threat, the President has determined that it is necessary to use units and personnel of the Armed Forces of the United States (Department of Defense military personnel) at appropriate ports of entry to support the Department of Homeland Security by temporarily protecting U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other United States Government personnel and by protecting their performance of Federal functions. Accordingly, the President has directed the Secretary of Defense to deploy appropriate numbers of Department of Defense military personnel to appropriate parts of entry to carry out this protection mission.

Mattis said there are currently about 5,764 active duty troops currently deployed."

According to Local 10 News, Otero fired several shots at Young, killing him on the scene. Police did not report how many times Young was shot.

CBP confirmed that Otero used her government-issued sidearm, a .40 caliber Smith & Wesson.

Although Oteros neighbors were surprised at the intrusion, they also admitted to worrying that the location of the neighborhood made such an incident likely.  One neighbor said, (I was) a bit surprised, a bit shocked, but you know, its a very quiet neighborhood around here, Well, it is Miami, so it can happen, but not in this neighborhood. This tends to happen in other neighborhoods. But this area has scared me always a bit because were so close to U.S. 1, so its a quick getaway.

Otero is on administrative leave pending completion of an investigation into the incident.

Authorities told the Des Moines Register that five to 10 others were injured and transported to local hospitals.

Most drivers abandoned their wrecked vehicles in the middle of the highway, but some drivers spent hours stuck in the crash with nowhere to go.

The Story County Sheriffs Department told KCCI that the pileup was one of the worst accidents the department had witnessed.

Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Nathan Ludwig said that eight people died on Iowas roads Monday due to accidents taking place on roads in white-out conditions.

You just have to wonder why people travel so fast when they cant see whats in front of them, Ludwig said. The majority of the accidents that are happening yesterday were because of those two things: traveling too fast and traveling to close to the car in front of you and not leaving an out to be able to stop.

Iowa state troopers responded to 185 crashes between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Monday, all accidents caused by the poor road conditions from inclement weather."
2018-07-06,Breitbart,SCOTUS Frontrunner Raymond Kethledges Record Reveals Immigration Weakness,"Since President George W. Bush appointed Kethledge to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, he has consistently demonstrated interpretations of immigration law at odds with the conservative wing of the Supreme Court and, more broadly, the notion that American immigration laws exist for the benefit of Americans. He has also shown a willingness to inject his own sympathies with the plight of illegal aliens facing deportation into his opinions.

In 2013, for example, Kethledge sided with an illegal alien who overstayed a tourist visa and then spent the next ten years, while in the country illegally, trying to get an employment visa. Two separate employers filed paperwork that would have allowed the Indian national to remain in the United States, and both times the applications were denied when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) found the jobs to be bogus. Kethledge ruled, over a dissent by a Bill Clinton-appointed judge, that the alien himself had a right to challenge the determination that the employers did not qualify to keep foreign workers in the country, rather than just the employers themselves.

Even more troubling for those who prefer an America First interpretation of immigration law, Kethledges opinion in Patel v. USCIS expressly rejected the governments contention that the sole purpose of those laws is to protect American workers and benefit American businesses that need foreign labor in qualifying circumstances where they cannot find Americans. One can speculate that Congress meant to exclude certain aliens to protect American workers, and admit other, qualified aliens to help American employers, Kethledge wrote. But there is no basis in the text of the statutenoneto conclude that Congress was completely indifferent to the interests of the qualified immigrants themselves.

Kethledge joined an opinion in Nguyen v. Holder blocking the deportation of a criminal with a green card who, after lying about an earlier drug conviction on his citizenship application, committed grand theft auto. Kethledge signed on to the opinion, by Jimmy Carter-appointee and notoriously left-leaning Judge Gilbert Merritt, holding that his conviction was not an aggravated felony mandating deportation. Another George W. Bush-appointed judge on the panel, while he agreed that grand theft auto was not a crime of violence and therefore not an aggravated felony for deportation purposes, rebuked the opinion Kethledge joined for going too far and not focusing on the federal definition of such a crime, which includes those includes those that involve a substantial risk that physical force may be used against property.

This was not a trivial distinction. Almost a decade later, this year, the Supreme Court addressed a very similar case involving residential burglary. Four conservative justices relied on the very same federal provision the concurrence in Nguyen cited. That law was struck down as unconstitutionally vague, allowing the convicted burglar to avoid deportation, by a single vote.

On Wednesday, immigration hawks began to raise the alarm on Kethledge and immigration, fearing that Trump may select him to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Bestseller author and columnist Ann Coulter, for example, called Kethledge an open borders zealot. By Thursday, Kethledges supporters were defending him against the charge, citing a number of cases in which he sided with enforcement against illegal aliens. Interpreting and applying immigration laws faithfully sometimes means upholding the removal of immigrants despite compelling or even heartwrenching personal stories, Kethledges former law clerk, Roger Meyers, writes in the National Review. In these cases, too, Judge Kethledge understands that his job is to follow the law, not to decide which side deserves more empathy.

The cases he cites, however, betray a pro-illegal alien sympathy that goes beyond what the law required to reach a decision, including significant discussion of the hardship facing the illegal aliens Kethledge is ruling against and even explicitly urging the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to allow them to stay, despite his admission the law allows their deportation.

In 2009s Ba v. Holder, Kethledge did, in fact, rule that he could not intervene on behalf of an illegal alien couple who did not raise the fact they come from a part of Africa where female genital mutilation (FGM) is common and feared their daughter could face the procedure if they were forced to return before their immigration judge and had allowed the deadline to raise such a claim. Kethledge, however, devoted a good portion of his opinion recounting, in gruesome detail, the mothers own experience with FGM. He goes on to effectively rule that, although the law prohibits his court from stepping in, the BIA should reverse themselves and grant the illegal aliens amnesty.

This evidence would have made out a compelling claim for asylum or withholding of removal, Kethledge wrote, citing an Obama era BIA case  of the kind that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has begun to rein in  offering a definition of asylum expanding beyond its traditional definition of people facing religious or political persecution.

Kethledge then attacked the immigration court ruling that the aliens ought to be deported based on their not even mentioning the evidence of FGM, writing, All that said, however, this remains a profoundly troubling case. ... by all appearances, the [immigration judges] rejection of her allegation was clearly erroneous.

Kethledge explicitly suggests the BIA bend the rules and allow the couple to stay in the United States. [T]he [BIAs] rule itself implicitly recognizes, certain cases call out for administrative grace. From our admittedly limited vantage point, this appears to be one of them, he wrote.

In 2015, Kethledge, as Meyers points out, ruled against an illegal alien who overstayed his visa by 19 years in Mora v. Holder. Kethledge, however, wrote separately from the courts decision, devoting much of a four-page concurrence to discussing how much of a model citizen the illegal alien was during those 19 years. Kethledge makes it clear that the law justifies the mans deportation, but, again writing seperately, took it upon himself to criticize the immigration judge for denying a hardship waiver based on the fact the illegal alien repeatedly lied to him during his hearing.

One might wonder, then, why the immigration judge denied Esquivels petition for a hardship waiver. The IJs oral decision leaves no doubt as to the reason why; and that reason had nothing to do with hardship. During the hearing before the IJ, Esquivel testified (falsely, as he later admitted in the hearing) that he had not been in contact with any of his siblings, when in fact he has been in contact with four of thembecause they too are present in this country illegally. The IJs reaction, to put it bluntly, was anger: the IJ went on for more than 12 pages in his oral decision about Esquivels lies and prevaricationscharacterizations that, in some instances, are truly tendentiousand found, as a result of them, that Esquivel was a person of bad character.

Kethledge even suggests that the illegal aliens decision to lie in immigration court was a noble act:

Once again, Kethledge admits the law does not allow him to grant the illegal alien amnesty, but that he thinks the immigration courts should. As our opinion today acknowledges, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the Attorney Generals decision to deny the discretionary relief that Esquivel seeks, he writes. But this case remains a deeply troubling one. The record leaves the distinct impression that, but for a combination of circumstances having nothing to do with hardship, the IJ might well have granted discretionary relief on grounds of hardship.

Beyond Kethledges decisions as a judge, there is evidence of a longer commitment to the cause of leniency for illegal aliens and opposition to immigration restriction. In all of the above decisions, for example, Kethledge uses the term illegal alien only once, in a footnote.

Before he was appointed to the federal bench by President Bush, Kethledge served from 1995 to 1997 as counsel for Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-MI) for the Senate Judiciary Committee, which handles immigration issues. It was during this exact period that, during the 1996 battles over immigration reform, that Abraham emerged one of the key Republicans who made reforms to crack down on illegal immigration and reduce mass migration to the United States impossible. Abraham worked against all efforts to restrict chain migration, the mechanism by which legal, non-merit-based immigration rose more than tripled from the 1960s to the 1990s. As the Center for Immigration Studies wrote in 1996:

Whatever Kethledges role in the formulation of Abrahams immigration policy, his immigration decisions as a judge indicate that, more than a decade later, he has not deviated from the pro-mass migration philosophy that drove them. In a field of potential Supreme Court nominees with strong, demonstrated America First understandings of immigration law, Kethledge stands out as liable to pursue a different path with a lifetime appointment."
2018-02-06,Breitbart,Four Months into FY 2018 Refugee Admissions Plunge to Lowest Level in 15 Years,"In the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, refugee admissions plunged to 2,840 during the first four months of FY 2002 (October 1, 2001 to January 31, 2002), and 5,340 the first four months of FY 2003 (October 1, 2002 to January 31, 2003) during the administration of George W. Bush.

The following year, refugee admissions during the first four months of FY 2004 (October 1, 2003 to January 1, 2004) jumped to 11,032, and remained at these much higher levels until now.

Overall, refugee admissions for FY 2002 were 27,110. They increased slightly to 28,881 in FY 2003, then jumped up to 52,818 in FY 2004, peaking at 84,995 in FY 2016, the last full year of the Obama administration.

On an annualized basis, if the level of refugee admissions for the remaining eight months of FY 2018 continue at the same rate as has been maintained for the first four months, total refugee admissions for FY 2018 will be less than 21,000, the lowest level since well before the September 11, 2001 attacks.

The 6,708 refugees admitted into the United States for the first four months of FY 2018 represents a 79 percent decline from the 32,448 admitted during the same four month period of FY 2017, all but ten days of which took place during the Obama administration.

Refugee advocates and the non-profit voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) that have collectively been paid more than $1 billion annually by the federal government for decades to resettle refugees were hopeful that a slight monthly increase in refugee admissions that had occurred from October to December might continue into January, but they were sorely disappointed.

A total of 1,248 refugees were admitted in October, 1,858 in November, and 2,217 in December.

But refugee admissions for January 2018 dropped to 1,368.

Christian refugees as a percentage of all refugees admitted were higher in January 2018 than in the first quarter of FY 2018, and Muslims were slightly lower.

Refugee admissions to the United States in the first quarter of FY 2018 under the Trump administration fell 79 percent to 5,323, compared to 25,671 in the first quarter of FY 2017 during the last three full months of the Obama administration, Breitbart News reported:

The faith background of refugees admitted to the United States during the first quarter of FY 2018, which began October 1, 2017 and ended on December 31, 2017, differed dramatically from that of refugees admitted during the same period one year earlier, from October 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Only 13 percent of refugees admitted during the first quarter of FY 2018, or 715 out of 5,323, were Muslim, while 60 percent, or 3,210 out of 5,323, were Christian, according to the State Departments interactive website. In contrast, 46 percent of refugees admitted during the first quarter of FY 2017, or 11,851 out of 25,671, were Muslim, while 44 percent, or 11,377 out of 25,671, were Christian.

In January 2018, 69 percent of all refugees admitted, or 963 out of 1,385, were Christian, and 12 percent of all refugees admitted, or 166 out of 1,385, were Muslim.

The country of origin for arriving refugees in January 2018 differed somewhat when compared to the first three months, the first quarter, of the fiscal year.

As Breitbart News reported last month, The top five countries of origin for refugees admitted during the first quarter of FY 2018 were: Bhutan (1,535), Democratic Republic of Congo (1,154), Burma (655), Ukraine (487), Eritrea (428).

The top five countries of origin from refugees admitted in January 2018 were the Ukraine (292), the Democratic Republic of Congo (268), Bhutan (251), Burma (138), and Eritrea (111).

On January 29, the Trump administration lifted the ban on refugees from 11 high risk countries, but also announced that additional security measures will be put in place for certain claimants.

The new measures, to be implemented by the Department of Homeland Security, as Breitbart News reported, include:

The changes came after a 90-day review of refugee admissions from Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and intelligence agencies, Reuters reported.

Time magazine, however, reported that The administration wont publicly confirm the 11 countries. But officials say they intend to review the list and update it six months from now.

It is unclear what impact the lifting of the restriction on admissions from these 11 high risk countries combined with the stricter security measure will have on the number of refugees admitted to the United States over the remaining eight months of FY 2018."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,Pence US Will Impose New Sanctions on North Korea Before Winter Olympics End,"U.S. officials said they would impose those sanctions before the end of the Winter Olympics, which means Pence will quite possibly be in Pyeongchang, South Korea, when they go into effect.

We will continue to isolate North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs once and for all, Pence declared during his six-day trip to Japan and South Korea.

The Washington Examiner notes that Pence strove to send the message that the Winter Olympics will not distract from the bellicose North Korean human rights abuses and nuclear program. He met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to discuss increasing pressure on North Korea.

We will not allow North Korean propaganda to hijack the message and imagery of the Olympic Games, he promised. Well be there to cheer our athletes, but well also be there to stand with our allies, and remind the world that North Korea is the most tyrannical and oppressive regime on the planet.

The United States is with you in this challenge. And we will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Japan, the people of South Korea, and our allies and partners across the region until we achieve the global objective of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, Pence said during his meeting with Abe.

The vice president added that the full range of the armed forces of the United States will continue to be dedicated to the protection of Japan, and that all options are on the table for dealing with North Korea. He is expected to make similar points to South Korean President Moon Jae-in when they meet on Thursday.

Pence said he remains open to meeting with North Korean representatives during his Olympic visit if they avail themselves of the opportunity. I have not requested a meeting, but well see what happens, he said.

We can not expect any meaningful dialogue with North Korea as long as they do not show genuine willingness and concrete action for the de-nuclearization, Prime Minister Abe agreed.

The L.A. Times notes that North Koreas Olympic delegation includes Kim Yong-nam, president of what passes for a legislature in the absolute dictatorship, and muses that even a ceremonial meeting between Pence and this highest-level North Korean official to visit the South in years could carry symbolic weight.

Neither Trump nor other administration officials offered details about what the new sanctions might entail. Reporters were told the details had to be kept under wraps to make it more difficult for the targets to devise methods of evading the new sanctions."
2018-02-08,Breitbart,Alarmist Climate Change Is About Immigration Reform LGBTQIA Rights Not Just Planet,"Writing in The Nation, Ms. Yona laments President Trumps appointment of a string of climate-change deniers to key positions in his administration, his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord and his assault on public lands, leading to her conclusion that Trumps policy is climate destruction.

For Ms. Yona, a Canadian graduate student at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, climate change is not an isolated issue but rather one thread on an ideological loom, woven together with other progressive causes into a single cohesive fabric.

During the past summer, Yona writes, I couldnt even think about wildfires breaking across the continent without thinking about trans rights. I couldnt think about Hurricane Irma without thinking about DACA.

Climate change isnt just about the planet. Its about justice: racial, social, socioeconomic, reproductive, and environmental, she continues. Its about immigration reform, LGBTQIA+ rights, and religious freedom.

I find myself unable to think of climate change on its own, Yona writes.

I cannot consider Hurricane Harvey without my mind racing to the undocumented families who could not leave Houston because ICE maintained checkpoints and borders, she adds. I cannot think about climate change without thinking about Charlottesville, about the long legacy of racism, xenophobia, and fascism in this country, and how the communities most affected by Trumps environmental rollbacks will be poor communities of color.

And yetto know that your work is inextricably linked to other fights for equality, and then to see the flood of battles headed our way: How on Earth do we keep from drowning? she asks.

While confessing that she isnt very hopeful these days, Ms. Yona finds encouragement on hearing how young generations are rising up to Donald Trump, to the deafness of politicians, and to the climate crisis.

Ms. Yonas essay offers a privileged window not only into the mentality of climate-change alarmists, but into the entire resistance movement that hopes to radically alter the values of American society. Her enumeration of causes supposedly linked to climate change reads like a wish-list of leftists who dream of refashioning the world in their own image.

Her very language suggests that the only real tie between climate change, immigration, transgender rights and social reform is in the common mentality that holds them together. This is why she cant think of one without the others.

Above all, it reveals that climate change activism is ideology. It is one useful cog in the machinery of an anti-intellectual, globalist movement whose primary cultural expression is identity politics.

Sooner or later, however, people tend to tire of ideology bereft of common sense. Ideology is a luxury of the elite that most cannot afford."
2018-07-07,Breitbart,Democrat Man Allegedly Threatened to Kill Long Island Trump Supporters,"Police said Martin Astrof, 75, threatened to kill Zeldins campaign worker and other Trump supporters at Zeldins Nesconset campaign office in Suffolk County on Friday morning, and almost ran over the worker with his vehicle when he backed his car up in an aggressive manner, the New York Post reported.

Astrof, who is a registered Democrat according to Suffolk County voter registration records, fled the scene in his vehicle before authorities apprehended him at his home on Friday afternoon.

Zeldrin spoke out against the attack Friday night, tweeting that his volunteer should not have been targeted for working hard to support a candidate he believes in:

Zeldin invited the campaign worker, Donato Panico, to attend Trumps State of the Union address in January for his efforts to feed first responders after 9/11.

Authorities charged Astrof with one felony count of making a terroristic threat and one count of second-degree reckless endangerment, police said. Astrof is expected to be arraigned on those charges Saturday."
2018-07-10,Breitbart,6 Insane Hot Takes on Brett Kavanaughs Supreme Court Nomination,"Here are six of the craziest theories and dumbest hot takes about Justice Kavanaugh:

In a piece titled Trump Trolls His Based With Kavanaugh Pick for Supreme Court, The Daily Beasts Matt Lewis describes Trumps selection of Kavanaugh as a letdown not just for conservatives, but also for Kavanaugh.

Kavanaugh, asserts Lewis, is perceived by conservatives as a boring establishment moderate. CNNs Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo expressed the same sentiment on Monday night. Partial transcript below of Cuomos and Tappers exchange:

CUOMO: But this is the establishments choice, you know that, right? CUOMO: This guy Kavanaugh checks the boxes for them. TAPPER: That was thought to be the strike against him  TAPPER:  that he was so close with the Bushes. Jeb Bush supported him, George W. Bush supported him. Im sure George H.W. Bush, given that he worked for him as well in the solicitor generals office.

An alumnus of the Daily Caller and current contributor to CNN, Lewis markets himself as a conservative.

Despite predicting Kavanaughs development into an excellent judge, National Reviews David French  once Bill Kristols presumptive spoiler candidate to take down Trump in the 2016 presidential race  describes Trumps selection as an opportunity lost. He argues Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be a preferable nominee, in that Barrett would better inflame the culture wars and help blunt the force of secular bigotry directed from the left against conservative and orthodox Christians.

Tonight I join many conservatives in a slight sigh of regret. There was a better choice, French concludes.

3. Trump Is Trying to Stay Out of Jail

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) accused Trump of nominating Kavanaugh as a get out of jail free card.

Well, first and foremost, we need to understand that this was the only pick amongst his entire list that has explicitly said that a president should not be a subject of a criminal investigation. Its almost as if the president said, let me find the person thats most going to protect me  under an investigation thats already led to over 70 charges, over 20 individuals, corporations have been charged, five guilty pleas, one sentencing. So we have an ongoing investigation that is a bi-partisan supported investigation as we saw throughout the Senate committee and a president who is saying, I now have a chance to make sure the Supreme Court gives me a get out of jail free card or indemnifies me against many issues that might come against me.

Several other talking heads made the exact same argument through the night, mostly on MSNBC:

4. Kennedys Son Was Paid Off by the Russians... Somehow

Neera Tanden, Clinton operative and president of the John Podesta-founded Center for American Progress (CAP), accused Anthony Kennedys son of unspecified corruption related to the Russian state and Trump via Twitter:

Tanden regularly frames the 2016 presidential election as having been corrupted by Russian state influence.



Stu Burguiere, co-host of Never Trump figurehead and ostensible conservative Glenn Becks eponymous radio show, cast Kavanaughs nomination as a broken campaign promise from the president. He took to Twitter to share his take:

Waxing feministic, CNNs Chris Cuomo criticized Trump for not selecting a woman nominee to the Supreme Court.

[President Donald Trump] could have picked a woman if it was that important to him, but he chose not to, Cuomo said after Trump selected Kavanaugh and not Barrett."
2018-02-06,Breitbart,FBI Arrests Freedom Fighter Bandit Allegedly Linked to Nine Bank Robberies in Georgia,"FBI agents in Atlanta, Georgia, took Nilsa Marie Urena, 25, into custody Saturday after she allegedly robbed a bank in Tennessee that day, Fox News reported.

Urena had been wanted for a series of bank robberies in the Atlanta area that began in October.

Shes been dubbed the Freedom Fighter Bandit because whenever she goes in, she passes a note or tells the teller that shes robbing the bank for some social cause, Atlanta FBI spokesman Kevin Rowson told Fox 5 Atlanta.

Rowson did not specify what social cause she allegedly robbed the banks for.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Urena, dressed in black from head-to-toe and wearing black sunglasses, passed a bank teller a note demanding money for the movement and for the streets.

She would claim to have a bomb, but did not use a gun to threaten her victims, police say.

The Freedom Fighter Bandit also reportedly used several young males she recruited online as accomplices.

Police arrested two of the suspected accomplices in connection with a January 19 robbery in Loganville, Georgia, but FBI officials say the suspects did not give the authorities enough information to capture Urena.

Authorities have not yet released information on Urenas charges."
2018-06-19,Breitbart,Ann Coulter Google Internet Media,"You havent met The Hills Jacqueline Thomsen! She was at a loss. The New Yorker? Whats that? Jacqueline thought and thought and thought, until her head hurt! Finally, she decided, as she wrote in The Hill, Its unclear what New Yorker article Coulter was referring to.

Armed only with the information that there was an article in a tiny little publication known as The New Yorker about asylum applicants being coached on their fake asylum claims, how could an American reporter ever hope to locate The Asylum Seeker in the Aug. 1, 2011, New Yorker? Forget Adios, America, where it is cited, along with many, many other sources. I cant read a BOOK, Thomsen thought to herself.

I Googled New Yorker asylum, and the article I was referring to came up as the third item in the list. Add coaching or coached, and its the very first item Google gives you. It took three seconds.

Thomsen: HOW DOES GOOGLE WORK, ANYWAY?

The New Yorker article begins with Caroline, an illegal alien from a middle-class family in Africa, who passed herself off to U.S. immigration authorities as a victim of rape and torture. As she admitted to The New Yorker, while giggling: I have never been raped.

Fortunately, Caroline had been tutored in how to act like a rape victim by her landlady in the Bronx, who hadnt been raped, either, but had successfully applied for asylum.

As she prepared to weep and lie through her interview with a very tough American immigration officer about her nonexistent torture and rape, Caroline said of the country she was lying her way into: I dont know why I didnt just go back. They are racists and xenophobes here.

Glad to have you, too, Caroline! (At least youd make a better reporter than Thomsen.)

Luckily, we have the very best government officials reviewing asylum applications. (Pasted on the window of one immigration officials office was a cover from the official Cuban Communist newspaper.) Carolines completely apocryphal asylum application was, naturally, approved.

Our immigration officials are so thorough, so hard to fool, that they granted Beatrice Munyenyezi asylum and citizenship, allowing her and her kids to live off the U.S. taxpayers for 10 years before federal prosecutors noticed, Hey! Munyenyezi wasnt a victim of the Rwandan genocide; she was a perpetrator! Munyenyezi had personally sentenced thousands of Rwandan women and children to death.

And now the poor murderess has been SEPARATED FROM HER CHILDREN!

Crack reporter Thomsen must have missed that story, too. For her reading pleasure, assuming she can read: Chris McGreal, Rwandan woman stripped of U.S. citizenship after lying about genocide, The Guardian, Feb. 22, 2013.

One asylum applicant written about in The New York Times claimed she was being persecuted in Russia because she was gay. She told her immigration lawyer, Im not gay at all. I dont even like gay people. (For ace Hill reporter Thomsen, who is hopelessly confused about books and Google, the cite is: Sam Dolnick, Asylum Ploys Play Off News to Open Door, The New York Times, July 12, 2011.)

Usually, frauds are only exposed when the asylum applicant makes the news. Youd think one of these times, an asylee would become famous and wed find out: Hey, this person really was fleeing persecution!

Nope. The pattern is: They make the news; we find out their asylum applications were total frauds.

Here are a few:

Ramzi Yousef was the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Bojinka plot, as well as the nephew of 9/11 architect Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Poor Yousef almost didnt make it through customs. Not only was his own passport of dubious provenance, but his traveling companion was carrying bomb manuals, car bombing videos  and instructions on how to lie to U.S. immigration inspectors. Yousef claimed asylum and was released into our country to execute the first WTC attack.

Sofitel hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo falsely accused the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, of rape. She had been granted asylum after memorizing a tape given to her by an American immigration activist about being gang raped in Guinea. (For Jackie How does Google work? Thomsen: Thats from the same Times article cited above.)

Amadou Diallo was all over the news after being killed by four New York City police officers in 1999. Only because of that, we found that, in his asylum application, he had claimed his parents had been murdered by the Mauritanian government. APPROVED!

In fact, Diallo was born into a prosperous Guinean family and his parents were alive and well  and looking for a settlement from New York taxpayers. (For super reporter Thomsen, youll find that story here: Alan Feuer, $3 Million Deal in Police Killing of Diallo in 99, The New York Times, Jan. 7, 2004.)

America is the most generous country on Earth, but  as The New York Times John Tierney demonstrated 20 years ago  even denizens of the nicest town lose patience when the third panhandler asks them for money. (For reporters who couldnt find their asses if you drew them a map: John Tierney, Mean Streets, The New York Times, May 12, 1996.)

Our country is being victimized by a network of con-artist foreigners and America-hating left-wingers passing out fake papers, fake stories and fake scripts to Third-Worlders, who lie about seeking asylum to get in on the American gravy train and wreck our country.

The crisis on the border today is no ordinary asylum fraud. Its a political stunt by a left-wing organization, Pueblo Sin Fronteras  People Without Borders  which believes, as its name suggests, that the U.S.A. has no right to have a border. This group has very publicly marched hordes of Latin Americans through thousands of miles of another country to demand entry into our country. Pueblo Sin Fronteras monthlong trek has been so well publicized that everyone in the country knows about it  except, apparently, our media.

The New York Times describes the horror thus: At some border crossings, migrants are being forced to wait for days or longer in Mexico.

Wait. Why dont they just stay in Mexico? Isnt Mexico a fantastic country with ZERO rapists? If not, maybe we should build something at the border  I dont know, maybe a wall?

Wall is a one-syllable word, so even Jacqueline Thomsen can understand that."
2018-02-09,Breitbart,Planned Parenthood and Marie Stopes Have Refused to Comply with Trumps Pro-Life Policy,"In order to receive U.S. funding, the NGOs must agree not to provide or promote abortion  even with funds not coming from the United States.

During a background briefing on the report on Wednesday, a senior administration official responded to a question from a reporter asking about the NGOs that have not agreed to the new rules.

Both Marie Stopes and International Planned Parenthood Foundation have made public comments, the official said. Consequently, those are obviously on record already.

At the start of his presidency last year, Trump reinstated what is known as the Mexico City Policy, which prohibits NGOs that receive U.S. funds from providing or promoting abortions overseas. The policy also bans these organizations from advocating for the passage of pro-abortion laws in other countries.

Trump updated the policy  called Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA)  by directing the Secretary of State to expand it across all global health assistance funding. This means that U.S. taxpayer dollars are not supporting organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), for example, is one such organization, with its long history of supporting Chinas one-child population control program, an agenda that has included forced abortions.

The abortion industry refers to the Mexico City Policy as the Global Gag Rule.

International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) said it refused to sign the order.

By refusing to sign the order, we are forecasted to lose $100 million in funding over the next three years, the organization states.

According to its 2016 annual report, IPPF more than one million abortions in that year, which represents an increase of 13.5 percent over 2015. The organization also received more than $27 million in U.S. government grants in 2015-2016, and reported a 12 percent increase in income and a net operating surplus of $7.6 million in 2016.

Marie Stopes International  which provides abortions and contraception to women all over the world  says its refusal to sign onto Trumps pro-life policy has left it with a funding gap of nearly $80 million.

We have been deeply moved by the support and donations we have received over the past year and we are doing everything in our power to mitigate the impact of this policy. However, unless we can fill the $80m gap created by the Global Gag Rule, it will deprive millions of women of the contraception they need to prevent an unintended pregnancy, and it is the worlds poorest women and girls who will bear the brunt.

The overwhelming 99.5% compliance rate shows that the dire prognostications of abortion advocates have not come true, said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser.

The Trump administrations pro-life policy has not reduced foreign assistance by a dime, but instead ensures that U.S. international aid partners act consistently to save lives, rather than promoting and performing abortion. Only a tiny minority of extreme pro-abortion groups has stubbornly refused to put the wellbeing of all women ahead of their agenda. The funds they forfeited have gone to worthy providers who respect the life, dignity, and values of women and families worldwide, as well as the will of American taxpayers. We thank President Trump for this life-affirming policy.

Similarly, Michael Anthony Mapa, Chairman of Filipinos for Life, posted to Facebook that he is grateful to Trump for reinstating the Mexico City Policy.

The U.S. Government should not be spending precious taxpayer dollars to promote the killing of babies around the world, he said. That is a crime against humanity. Im glad that President Trump is putting an end to federal funds to promote it.

Carmel Nisha Pius Franco, Director of Uyirkkural  or Voice of Life  said in a statement to SBA List, Indian women need life, dignity, education and empowerment, not abortion.

We have been exploited through decades-long population control propaganda which has resulted in at least 300 million abortions (16 million abortions being performed in India in just one year) and dangerous sub-replacement fertility rate. Americans do not want their hands in the blood of innocent children killed in India. Yes, we need to deal with development issues, but not by killing our children. Thanks to President Trump for setting things right because we believe in one nation under God, which would be a beacon of hope amidst moral calamity, not the nation which promotes death.

SBA List provides further information about IPPF:

Marie Stopes says abortion is at the core of its mission. Its staff has been caught on tape boasting about providing illegal abortions around the world.

In December 2016, Marie Stopes UK branch was forced to temporarily suspend abortion services for children and vulnerable populations due to serious safety concerns."
2018-02-08,Breitbart,Media Fail Trump More Popular than Obama at This Point in Presidency,"On that same date, a full 56 percent disapproved of the job Obama was doing. On the other hand, only 51 percent say the same about Trump  a +5 point advantage for our current president, and an overall advantage of +9.

This is nothing less than a massive failure for the American media  proof that this disgraced institution is now so discredited they can no longer move the needle.

In February of 2010, the media were into year two of licking Obamas boots, which is why he defied gravity throughout eight terrible years of economic stagnation, unceasing scandals (fast and furious, Benghazi, the IRS, you can keep your insurance) and countless foreign policy bungles.

Fast forward to today and you have the entire institution of the media beating Trump bloody with more than 90 percent negative news, most of it manufactured lies about Russia and obstruction of justice.

The full brunt and force of the media is focused against Trump... In fact, the intensity of the media attacks have only increased since Trumps approval ratings started to improve two weeks ago.

And still he sits at 48 percent approval, or +4 points ahead of the medias Precious Barry.

In all my years of watching the media, I have never seen anything like this  a media utterly incapable of moving the needle of public opinion. During the 2016 presidential election, the media were at least able to affect the polls. Those polls turned out wrong, but the media at least moved that needle. There has never been a time when a media freak out did not in some way result in some movement in public opinion. But that is exactly what we are seeing today.

Today, the media are so lacking in moral authority, so ineffective, so incapable of shaping public opinion, their unceasing screeching is backfiring. Trump is becoming more popular, as are his policies, even on the issue of immigration, which is supposed to a third rail for racist Republicans.

Another reason the media are so freaked out right now is the implosion of the Mueller investigation. Despite the media making a public spectacle of themselves in their fight against transparency (the release of the Nunes memo); despite the medias efforts to then downplay the bombshells within that memo after it was released, none of this worked.

Thanks to alternative media, the people are learning the truth, which is why the MSMs increasingly desperate 24/7 screeching of Russia! Russia! Russia! (that laughably includes reheating fake news from last year) is being ignored, is now a white noise no one hears anymore.

Basically, these four things are happening....

1) After unceasing amounts of fake news, the media have lost all credibility with a public that only sees them as hysterical and partisan antagonists towards the president.

2) The public is beginning to realize that there is not a single shred of evidence that Trump colluded with the Russians, or that he in any way obstructed justice. Despite two years of media assurances, millions in corporate media dollars spent to uncover wrongdoing, countless leaks, and a full-scale investigation run by Trump antagonists in the Deep State  they have found exactly bupkis.

3) The only real and verifiable evidence of 2016 election meddling has exposed Democrats, Hillary Clinton, and the FBI, as the bad actors.

4) As the public tunes out the medias histrionics and conspiracy theories, they instead focus on the actual job Trump is doing, and have come to the conclusion that he is doing a damn fine job in every respect. ISIS is on the run, the economy is humming, jobs are being created...

After two years of The Media Who Cried Watergate! at every twist and turn in all things Trump, the people are now ignoring these neurotic fools and liars to think about things that matter. And as of right now, when it comes to what matters, the public is happier with Trump than they were with Barry.

2018-06-12,Breitbart,Border Patrol Agents Seize 25M in Cocaine in South Texas,"Agents assigned to the Sarita Border Patrol Checkpoint in Kenedy County, Texas, observed a Dodge Caravan approaching their inspection station on Friday. Following an initial interview, the agents referred the driver to a secondary inspection station, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.

After further questioning, agents conducted a physical search of the Caravan. During the inspection, the agents discovered 30 bricks of what would test positive as being cocaine, officials stated. The cocaine weighed more than 75 pounds. Border Patrol officials estimate the value of the drug shipment to be in excess of $2.5 million.

The agents arrested the driver and the passenger. No information was provided about the two people who were arrested. The agents seized the drug shipment and the vehicle.

The agents turned the two suspects and the drugs over to U.S. Customs and Border Protections Homeland Security Investigations for further investigation.

2018-07-18,Breitbart,Dems Left Wing Media Claim Russian Hacking an Act of War,"Standing alongside Putin, President Trump steered clear of confrontation with the Russian, while questioning U.S. intelligence and last weeks federal indictments of 12 Russians for hacking into Democratic email accounts to purportedly hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today, President Trump said following a two hour one-on-one meeting with his Russian counterpart. He just said its not Russia. I will say this: I dont see any reason why it would be.

President Trumps remarks prompted an onslaught of calls for the U.S. to respond to Russias alleged meddling, described as an act of war.

Leading up to the high stakes meeting between President Trump and Putin, CNN New Day host Chris Cuomo repeatedly accused Russia of election hacking to wage war against the U.S. The big, ugly white elephant in the room will be the U.S. election hacking, Cuomo speculated. Weve been calling it meddling, but Im trying to stay away from the word because its just way too mild. This is an act of war.

The CNN host described the Russian hacking allegations as the truth: How does [Donald Trump] raise the act of war of the hacking and different attacks during the U.S. election when Vladimir Putin knows damn well that President Trump doesnt really believe the truth and doesnt put a whole lot of stock in the event itself?

HuffPos Mike Signorile published an opinion-editorial on Monday morning affirming Russia committed an act of war, while accusing President Trump of refusing to discuss the allegations of meddling with the Russian President. You dont have to believe there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to see this clearly: When Vladimir Putin and his top military intelligence officers facilitated the hacking of the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintons campaign, they engaged in an act of war against the United States, Signorile writes. And thats what Republicans would be calling it  war  if they werent in the tank with President Donald Trump, who, instead of strongly condemning Russia, is cozying up to Putin and is infuriated that he and his campaign are under investigation for colluding with Russia and obstructing the probe.

Politico joined HuffPo and MarketWatch in publishing its own analysis of the Helsinki summit, yet again lamenting President Trumps decision to repair U.S. relations with Russia instead of relitigating Putins act of war, during the 2016 election.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told MSNBCs Morning Joe, ahead of the Trump-Putin showdown, that the U.S. faces a continuing act of war by Vladimir Putin. The Democrat lawmaker said:

I can recall vividly John McCain and I in one Armed Services Committee after another at hearings with our cyber experts saying to them, under the [Barack] Obama administration as well as this administration, why has there been no definition of an act of war in cyber, because we have been attacked. It is an act of war. DNC chairman Tom Perez told CNNs Natalie Allen Monday that he believes Russian interference constitutes an act of war, and yet, it was not pressing enough for the party to turn over its servers for inspection to the FBI. President Trump suggests there was some nefarious reason the DNC didnt turn over its computer servers after the hacking was discovered, and in fact in January 2017 the FBI said the DNC had rebuffed its request to examine computer servers. Have you since then given the FBI or special counsel investigators access? the CNN host asked the embattled party leader. The DNC chair not only dodged the question but shifted into talking point mode, accusing the Russians of committing an act of war by meddling in the 2016 elections. Perez claimed: The DNC cooperated throughout. And the matter at hand is that the Russians, they not only hacked the DNC, they hacked the (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee), they attempted to infiltrate secretaries of state, and boards of elections. They were successful in one state getting ... roughly a half a million individual names and personal information, Perez added. And they did this so that they could attempt to swing our elections. That is an act of war, and if we had a Democrat in the White House right now, we would have a cabinet thats dealing with this. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) made similar remarks to his Democrat colleague Sen. Blumenthal on Tuesday, asserting to Hill.TV hosts Krystal Ball and Buck Sexton that Russian interference in the 2016 election embodied an act of war, even going as far as to equate the Kremlins acts to an invasion of U.S. territory. Cohen said: It was a foreign interference with our basic Democratic values. The underpinnings of Democratic society is elections, and free elections, and they invaded our country. A cyber attack that made Russian society valueless. They could have gone into Russian banks, Russian government. Our cyber abilities are such that we could have attacked them with a cyber attack that would have crippled Russia. Hollywood actor-director Rob Reiner, whose new film Shock and Awe grossed a mere $41,000 on its opening weekend, declared Tuesday that the United States was attacked by Russia in the last election. The United States was attacked. We didnt see bombs hitting Pearl Harbor. We didnt see planes crash into buildings. But cyber missiles struck the heart of our Democracy. It was an insidious Act of War. Anyone who aids and abets this is committing Treason. We didnt see bombs hitting Pearl Harbor. We didnt see planes crash into buildings. But cyber missiles struck the heart of our Democracy, tweeted Reiner. It was an insidious Act of War. Anyone who aids and abets this is committing Treason. President Donald Trump sought Tuesday to clarify his public undermining of American intelligence agencies, saying he had misspoken when he said he saw no reason to believe Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. The sentence should have been, I dont see any reason why I wouldnt, or why it wouldnt be Russia instead of why it would, Trump said, in a rare admission of error by the bombastic U.S. leader. His comment came  amid rising rebuke by his own party  about 27 hours after his original, widely reported statement, which he made at a Monday summit in Helsinki standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. I accept our intelligence communitys conclusion that Russias meddling in the 2016 election took place, Trump said Tuesday. But he added, as he usually does, It could be other people also. A lot of people out there. There was no collusion at all. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,White House Confirms Donald Trump Wish for Military Appreciation Parade,"President Trump is incredibly supportive of Americas great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement to reporters. He has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation.

The Washington Post first broke the news citing a military official who said that the president gave marching orders to military officials to come up with ideas similar to the military parade in France for Bastille Day. Trump attended the French parade in July 2017.

The president was impressed by the show of military prowess, referring to the spectacle during his meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in New York in September.

It was one of the greatest parades Ive ever seen, Trump marveled at the time, adding, Because of what I witnessed, we may do something like that on July 4th in Washington, down Pennsylvania Avenue. I dont know. Were going to have to try and top it."
2018-07-23,Breitbart,Two-Thirds of Democrats Say Trump Treason Charge Is Sincere,"Overall, 45 percent of likely voters believe the charges are made sincerely while 46 percent believe that charges are made for political purposes, says Rasmussens July 19-22 poll of 1,000 likely voters.

Among Republicans, 25 percent say the claim is made sincerely, while 67 percent say the claim is made for political purposes. Seventy-two percent of conservatives say the claim is made for political purposes.

Twenty-five percent Republicans and 65 percent of Democrats say the charges are sincere, and 27 percent and 67 percent of the two parties say the claims are made for political reasons. The two sets of different perspectives create a very wide forty-point gap between the two parties members.

The Rasmussen question does not ask people if they believe the claim, but only if they believe the claim is made sincerely."
2018-02-06,Breitbart,National Weather Service in Hot Water After False Tsunami Warning,"Cell phones from the U.S. Eastern Seaboard to as far away as Texas and Florida received the warning on Tuesday morning, released by the NWS and pushed out by private sector weather forecast organizations, including AccuWeather.

AccuWeather was quick to blame the federal government and issued a press release on Twitter, saying it has a sophisticated system for interpreting the information it gets from the NWS.

The press release says, in part:

The responsibility is on the NWS to properly and consistently code the messages, for only they know if the message is correct or not. As reported by AccuWeather, once discovered that the NWS had incorrectly coded the warning, we sent messages via social channels that no tsunami warning is in effect for the East Coast of the U.S. This is not the first time legitimate warning coding was embedded erroneously by the NWS and consequently triggered alerts. In October 2014, AccuWeather advised NWS in writing about the potential for this problem to be repeated if not fixed. This is all a matter of public record. We are continuing to work with NWS to determine why this coding was improperly embedded in its test alert system.

The NWS, without naming AccuWeather, defended itself in a statement to the Hill, which said it had issued a test message to at least one private forecaster.

The National Tsunami Warning Center, part of the National Weather Service, issued a routine test message at approximately 8:30 a.m. ET this morning, an NWS spokesperson wrote in an email. The test message was released by at least one private sector company as an official Tsunami Warning, resulting in reports of tsunami warnings received via phones and other media across the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean.

The NWS told the Hill it was investigating the incident while trying to shift blame for the mistaken alert.

The test message was not disseminated to the public via any communication channels operated by the National Weather Service, the statement adds.

Were currently looking into why the test message was distributed by at least one private sector company and will provide more information as soon as we have it.

Although the warning did create a stir in the states where cell phones received the alert, the mistake was corrected in about five minutesmore than half an hour sooner than it took to reverse the warning in Hawaii that caused widespread panic."
2018-02-08,Breitbart,Washington Post Met Twice with Hoax Dossier Author Christopher Steele During 2016 Election,"At least one of the meetings was also attended by Glenn R. Simpson, co-founder of the controversial opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The meetings took place in September and October of 2016.

The Post wrote that it made efforts to independently confirm Steeles information at the time, but was unable to corroborate his specific findings and did not publish stories based on the material.

The first meeting was held in The Posts D.C. headquarters in late-September 2016 in the runup to the presidential election less than two months later.

As Steele sat down in a seventh-floor conference room at The Posts downtown Washington headquarters in late September 2016, he looked out at the bustling newsroom with obvious discomfort. Dont you have any meeting space without glass walls? the longtime intelligence officer asked. On that September day, Steele talked for almost two hours  occasionally interrupted by Simpson, who was in attendance.

The Post reported it held a second session with Steele in October 2016, and agreed to keep the meeting off the record:

The Post agreed to keep the session off the record because of the sensitivity of the material, but is now reporting the existence of the visit and a subsequent one in October  although not what was discussed  because they have been referenced in court documents. Around the same time, Steele also met with other news organizations including the New York Times, the New Yorker and Yahoo News, according to court filings. In an article published on Sept. 23, 2016, Yahoo chief investigative correspondent Michael Isikoff reported that U.S. officials had received intelligence reports alleging that (Carter) Page had met with Igor Sechin, executive chairman of the Russian energy corporation Rosneft, while in Moscow in July  a finding of Steeles research. Page has denied meeting with Sechin but later acknowledged interacting with one of his deputies.

The details about the newspapers two meetings with Steele were contained within a nearly 4,100-word February 6 Post article titled, Hero or hired gun? How a British former spy became a flash point in the Russia investigation.

The Post did not make clear whether during the time of the meeting the newspaper was aware that Fusion GPS was being paid to conduct the firms anti-Trump work on behalf of both Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The newspaper  reported on those financial arrangements in October 2017.

This is not the first time Steeles contacts with news outlets have been disclosed, but it marks the first time The Post detailed its meetings.

A four-page House Intelligence Committee memo released last week alleging abuse of surveillance authority revealed that Steele had been terminated as an FBI source after the agency discovered he had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media about his relationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016 article published by Mother Jones. The memo cites court filings in which Steele admitted to meetings with other news outlets. The memo also cited Steeles meeting with Yahoo News, as related in a court filing.

When Buzzfeed published Steeles full dossier on January 10, 2017, the website related the information had been circulating among elected officials, intelligence agents, and journalists for weeks. Later in the article, the website stated the dossier information had circulated for months.

2018-02-06,Breitbart,DACA Fix High-Skilled Indian Workers Rally to Support Trumps Merit-Based Immigration Program,"Most of those present were experts in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) field.

The rally was organized by the Republican Hindu Coalition (RHC), a Hindu-American community organization founded by Chicago-based inventor and entrepreneur Shalabh Shalli Kumar in 2015 under the leadership of Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and many other senior leaders of the Republican Party.

It was quite evident from this rally that Hindus totally debunk the mainstream narrative of Trump being a racist, a press release issued by the RHC read:

Some of the signs held up read, We Love Trump, Trump Loves Hindus, Trump is the Best, Make America Proud Again, Boycott Fake News, Trump Is Not a Racist, Trump Great on Taxes, Trump Great on Crime, Trump Bringing Ramrajya (Rule of God), End Chain Migration, End Country Limit: Bring the Best and the Brightest, End Visa Lottery, DACA Fix: Purple Cards, No Citizenship, Fee to Build the Wall, Dont Forget Legal Childhood Arrivals, DALCA Kids Deserve Better, Cut Green Card Backlog, Hire American Buy American, DACA Broke the law, and DALCA Obeyed the Law.

According to the RHC, Besides 700,000 DACA kids, there are 200,000 DALCA kids, children of legal immigrants-in-line from India, who have never broken the law, but who simply age out at 21 and have to go back, because their parents have a 60 year wait to get their green card after it is approved.

President Trump recently stated that merit-based immigration should be a requirement for any DACA fix.

During the rally, members of the RHC indicated their belief that DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) should be referred to as DAICA (Deferred Action for Illegal Childhood Arrivals). The press release about the event further stated, RHC declared at the Rally that it has full sympathy of DAICA kids, but there should be Compassion with Justice. DAICA kids want security. They want the threat of deportation, a sword hanging on their necks, removed.

Many of Saturdays demonstrators were reportedly software engineers and other technical workers from South Asia who were able to enter the United States through H1-B visas. When I came here, my daughter was six years old, Nandu Konduri, 45, a software engineer in North Carolina, told the Washington Post. Konduri has reportedly been waiting for his green card application to be processed since 2007. He reportedly added, Many kids have already aged out. We feel stuck.

Breitbart News has reported, According to the book Ab Ki Baar Trump Sarkar! (roughly translated as Next Time It Will Be the Trump Administration), which chronicled Kumars contributions to the Trump campaign, the Democratic Party took Indian-American votes for granted for many years. The phrase ab ki baar Trump sarkar was inspired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis campaign.

Indian and Hindu-Americans contributed significantly to Trumps historic victory. According to Kumar, more than one million Hindu American voters changed their registration from Democrat to Republican when then-candidate Trump spoke at a huge Hindu rally on October 15, just three weeks before the November election.

2018-06-19,Breitbart,Report North Koreans Will Root for South Korea at World Cup,"Soccer is among the top three sports in North Korea  the other two being table tennis and volleyball  and millions of North Koreans will be watching the games on TV, according to Reuters.

One defector from the oppressive north told Reuters that soccer is cherished and is a sport that boosts solidarity and collectivity, which are crucial elements in North Korean society.

Even if there are political tensions, defectors say that North Korean citizens have always supported their South Korean fellows for the World Cup. We would, of course, be rooting for the South, even when inter-Korean relations are frosty, defector Hong Kang-cheol exclaimed.

The North Korean team failed to qualify for the tournament, but the South qualified for its ninth consecutive appearance at the games. The South Korean team lost 1-0 to Sweden during Mondays game and is next scheduled to meet Mexico on June 23. But to date, success seems to be eluding the south. Out of six games so far, the South Koreans have won one, tied one and lost the rest."
2018-06-15,Breitbart,France Police Foil Islamist Terror Plots to Bomb Swingers Club Attack Homosexuals,"In raids conducted in the Seine-et-Marne region east of Paris at the weekend, police discovered knives, a detonation system and jihadist propaganda in the possession of two men who were charged on suspicion of planning to carry out an Islamic State-inspired attack.

The individuals, said to be friends in their early 20s who were previously unknown to security services, came to the attention of General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) intelligence officers a few weeks ago, a source close to the investigation said.

Describing the pair as very determined to commit acts of terror, the source told French newspaper LExpress that the men had on a number of occasions exchanged messages which spoke of a project to carry out an attack.

Their plan was still ill-defined at this stage, but there were elements to suggest they planned to attack homosexuals, one source added.

Hours after officers confirmed the two men had been charged by an anti-terror judge, and then detained, police announced that they had thwarted the fifth Islamic extremist attack in France so far in 2018, this one targeting a swingers club.

The suspect, a 38-year-old convert to Islam who had become radicalised was arrested in the Indre region of central France after an improvised explosive device was found at his home and the man admitted that he wanted to use it to target a swingers club, a source told AFP.

Charged with preparing to commit an act of terrorism and associating with terrorist criminals, the native to Frances Loiret region was taken into custody on  May 17, according to a judicial source.

The accused is also being prosecuted for fraud in connection with a terrorist enterprise and fraudulent obtaining of administrative documents in connection with a terrorist enterprise, French media reports.

The news came just weeks after the country suffered its latest deadly terror attack, in which Chechen immigrant Khamzat Azimov lunged at strangers with a knife while shouting Allahu akhbar.

Despite repeated insistence by left-wing Western leaders  usually after calls from opposition politicians in the wake of a terror attack urging the government to crack down on mass migration from the third world  that Islamic extremism must not be allowed to change our way of life, authorities in France announced a ban on public screenings of World Cup 2018 matches as a result of the ongoing security threat in the nation."
2018-06-16,Breitbart,Brooks Trump Did a Good Thing With North Korea in the Worst Possible Way,"On Fridays PBS NewsHour, New York Times columnist David Brooks said President Trump did do a good thing with North Korea by settling tensions, but did so in the worst possible way by ignoring North Koreas human rights abuses.

Brooks stated, I give him more credit than a lot other people that Im reading. You know, we were  and people who really knew the North Korean situation were terrified six, eight, 10 months ago that we were really heading in a bad direction and things  there was some danger of things spinning out of control. And now, that doesnt seem to be the case. Now, theres  tensions have settled. There seems to be no risk of any confrontation or war. And so, to me, thats the big story, and thats the lead, and thats a good thing.

He continued, Now, once you get down to the second and third paragraph, it begins to deteriorate quickly. And the things Trump said about the regime, calling a murderous dictator a tough guy, thats horrific. The way human rights are treated, the way he just flippantly tossed off the practice, the war games, is horrific. But, to me, those are serious deficits. He did a good thing in the worst possible way."
2018-06-18,Breitbart,Facebook Boosts Audit Committee Power in Attempts to Avoid Another Data Scandal,"Facebooks audit committee, which is currently overseen by former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, changed its name from the audit committee to the audit and risk oversight committee, Business Insider reports. Along with a name change, the powers of the committee and the aspects of Facebook that the committee oversees were also expanded.

The committee will now focus on three major issues:

These reviews will be conducted once a year by Erskine Bowles and industry executives Marc Andreessen, Kenneth Chenault, and Jeffrey Zients. Facebooks decision to provide more power to the committee is likely a result of pressure from shareholders, a proposal for an independent oversight committee was tabled at Facebooks investor meeting last month after 45 percent of the companys independent shareholders expressed support for it.

Senior vice president of Trillium Asset Management, Jonas Kron, tabled the idea on behalf of its client the Park Foundation, and welcomed Facebooks decision to increase the power of its audit committee, telling Business Insider: This is a very necessary and positive development. It provides investors with a clearer understanding of who has ultimate responsibility for overseeing privacy, social impact, cybersecurity, and compliance.

Kron manages approximately $10 million of Facebooks stock on behalf of the Park Foundation and warned that the committee should be given appropriate power over Facebooks management and should meet approximately every three months, or twice a year."
2018-07-21,Breitbart,UK Gay Lobby Lashes Out at Rev Franklin Graham for Bigotry Hate,"One gay British Christian activist, Jayne Ozanne, said the upcoming festival will provide a platform for espousing bigotry and hate in Christs name.

It seems particularly unfortunate that this is occurring during a time when many of us are trying to build bridges of understanding between groups who hold widely opposing views, she said.

Another leader of the LGBT community denounced Graham for his views on homosexuality and for praying for gays.

LGBT+ people have been hurt, humiliated, silenced, abused and prayed for in the past, said Tracey Byrne, the chief executive of the gay Christian organization OneBodyOneFaith in an email to the HuffPost.

Grahams underlying theology is one which does grave damage to LGBT people, in the name of God, Byrne said, urging that this theology be called out in the strongest possible terms.

Byrne praised a recent decision by the Blackpool Transport company to ban advertisements for Grahams three-day festival from the sides of its buses, saying it was absolutely the right thing to do.

Blackpool Transport had posted ads for the festival on a number of its buses but pulled them all down under pressure from activists who object to Grahams biblical morality.

The removal of these adverts is as a result of us listening and acting on customer and public feedback which we aim to do at all times, said the companys managing director, Jane Cole, in a statement.

Blackpool Transport is a proud ongoing supporter of the Pride and LGBT+ communities and in no way did we intend to cause any distress or upset.

Organizers of the Lancashire Festival of Hope, which will take place at the Winter Gardens Blackpool between September 21 and September 23, 2018, called the companys decision to remove the bus ads a travesty and noted that the sole purpose of the event is to share the hope of Jesus Christ.

Because the Christian community is also a customer, we hope Blackpool Transport will listen to our public feedback as well, and not show what appears to be a potential bias toward Christians, organizers said.

The Blackpool Council, which owns the Winter Gardens venue where the festival is taking place, has warned festival organizers that the rally must comply with U.K. laws against inciting hatred.

If matters are brought to our attention, that could constitute incitement to hatred, we will forward these to the relevant public authorities and should this be proved we will not hesitate to terminate this booking, the council said in a statement last year.

In a response on Facebook, Rev. Graham said he was coming to England to preach about hope for today, hope for tomorrow, and hope for eternity.

Im sorry that some see hope as offensive, but I can assure you that tens of thousands of people in Blackpool and across the United Kingdom are searching for hope, he said.

Sex, drugs, money, even religionnone of these are the answer, he added. Im coming to share with everyone in Blackpool, Lancashire, and across North West England that there is One who can give you hope. Hope for today, hope for tomorrow, and hope for eternity.

His name is Jesus Christ! he said."
2018-02-13,Breitbart,Disney Chief Bob Iger to Hold Elite Fundraiser for Vulnerable Dems,"According to Variety, the six senators are Bill Nelson of Florida, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. Each hails from states President Trump handily won in 2016.

Iger is a bigtime Democrat donor and for a time his name was even tossed around as a possible presidential candidate to challenge Trumps re-election in 2020.

Plans for that 2020 challenge cooled considerably, however, after a #MeToo cloud descended over Iger and Disney. Until 2005, Disney owned Harvey Weinsteins Miramax. This was during a time when Weinstein (another big Democrat donor) is alleged to have raped Rose McGowan and to have settled at least one sexual harassment suit.

Disney also owned ABC when disgraced left-wing pundit Mark Halperin is alleged to have acted inappropriately with a number of junior female staffers.

Disney is also dealing with a major Pixar scandal, another company overseen by Iger, that lost its chief, John Lasseter, after he was forced to take an extended leave due to numerous allegations of sexual misconduct.

Igers contributions to Democrats have also been cultural. Despite high ratings, a mini-series based on the September 11, 2001, terror attacks has been memory-holed by Disney because it accurately depicted mistakes made by Bill Clintons administration. Iger is a supporter of Hillary Clintons.

Igers fundraiser will take place next week in Los Angeles and coincide with a $10,000 fundraiser in Santa Monica hosted by artist Charlie Kaplan for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and California Governor Jerry Brown will be the headliners.

2018-07-10,Breitbart,Trump Defies McConnell with SCOTUS Pick,"Democrats, including former staff for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are already seizing on McConnells advice to the president as a line of attack against Kavanaugh.

McConnell, as Breitbart News and the New York Times reported on Saturday night, was pushing Trump to pick Judge Ray Kethledgeor Judge Tom Hardimansince McConnell believed they would face an easier Senate confirmation than Kavanaugh or Judge Amy Coney Barrett.

McConnell has said he does not want a SCOTUS battle in an election year, one source who had been briefed on McConnells private comments to many people in Washington told Breitbart News on Saturday. He thinks Kethledge would be easy to confirm because Kethledge is not a consistent conservative.

Breitbart News reached out to McConnells office for comment at 7:32 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday evening. About an hour laterat 8:26 p.m. Eastern Time, per the RSS feed for the New York Timesthe Times published its story on the matter.

The piece, from the Times Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin, reported as such:

Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, told President Trump this past week that Judges Raymond M. Kethledge and Thomas M. Hardiman presented the fewest obvious obstacles to being confirmed to replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court, according to Republican officials briefed on the conversation. While careful not to directly make the case for any would-be justice, Mr. McConnell made clear in multiple phone calls with Mr. Trump and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, that the lengthy paper trail of another top contender, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, would pose difficulties for his confirmation. Mr. McConnell is concerned about the volume of the documents that Judge Kavanaugh has created in his 12 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as well as in his roles as White House staff secretary under President George W. Bush and assistant to Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton.

Twenty minutes later, at 8:46 p.m. Eastern Time, McConnell spokeswoman Antonia Ferrier told Breitbart News, in response to the original press request: The Leader has said publicly that hes confident the President will select someone in the mold of Justice Gorsuch. I cant speak to the theories of those anonymous sources.

She did not, however, answer follow-up questions on Saturday on whether McConnell thought Kavanaugh could easily be confirmed, as Breitbart News reported on Saturday night:

But, now that President Trump has selected on Kavanaugh, McConnell has issued a statement publicly praising himas statements roll in from GOP senators across the Senate praising Kavanaugh and looking forward to his confirmation.

McConnell said on Monday evening in response to the presidents announcement of Kavanaugh as his selection:

President Trump has made a superb choice. Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an impressive nominee who is extremely well qualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Kavanaugh has sterling academic credentials. He is widely admired for his intellect, experience, and exemplary judicial temperament. He has won the respect of his peers and is highly regarded throughout the legal community. And his judicial record demonstrates a firm understanding of the role of a judge in our Republic: Setting aside personal views and political preferences in order to interpret our laws as they are written. I look forward to meeting with Judge Kavanaugh and to the Senates fair consideration of his nomination, beginning with the work of Chairman Grassley and the Judiciary Committee. This is an opportunity for Senators to put partisanship aside and consider his legal qualifications with the fairness, respect, and seriousness that a Supreme Court nomination ought to command.

Haberman, in a tweet less than an hour before Trumps announcement of his selection of Kavanaugh, argued that aides in the White House fumed about the Times piece on McConnellsaying the public revelation that McConnell was pushing Kethledge or Hardiman may have shifted Trump back to Kavanaugh.

While all of this jockeying behind the scenes may not mean much now that the selection is Kavanaugh and the president has formally nominated the D.C. Circuit Judge for the Supreme Court, it is worth noting that the Democrats are already pouncing on McConnells comments behind the scenes in lobbying against Kavanaugh.

Brian Fallon, a prominent Democrat strategist, is a former spokesman for Schumer and for 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. Trump soundly defeated Clinton in November 2016 in the general election, beating her in 30 and a half states and winning 306 electoral votes. Clinton did not even win 20 states."
2018-07-12,Breitbart,Brennan Strzok Did a Great Job - Putin Must Be Very Happy With Discord Thats Being Sown in C,"On Thursdays MSNBC Live, former CIA Director John Brennan stated he thought did a great job in his testimony before Congress and Mr. Putin must be looking with quite a bit of glee, in terms of what just transpired in the halls of Congress and this committee meeting, that I think, really was a mockery of the oversight function, a responsibility that is supposed to be a bipartisan effort to try to make sure that we keep this country strong and safe.

Brennan said, Im personally glad that Peter Strzok had an opportunity to talk publicly about this, and so the American people could see his professionalism, as well as what I think is his integrity. Were all imperfect human beings, and I think Pete would like to be able to have back some of the actions that he took, but theres no indication whatsoever in what he said, or in fact in the Department of Justices inspector general report, that indicates that any personal views, political views that he may have held, like all the rest of us, had any influence or impact on his professional responsibilities. I think he was able to handle those questions in a very professional manner. ... Pete, I think did a great job.

He later added, Vladimir Putin must be very happy, as well as Russian intelligence and security services because of the discord thats being sown in the halls of Congress here. ... I think that Mr. Putin must be looking with quite a bit of glee, in terms of what just transpired in the halls of Congress and this committee meeting, that I think, really was a mockery of the oversight function, a responsibility that is supposed to be a bipartisan effort to try to make sure that we keep this country strong and safe. But unfortunately, I think Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Gowdy demonstrated that they are more interested in protecting Mr. Trump, and preventing the continued investigation from moving forward, and taking these cheap shots, and thats what I call them, cheap shots, at Pete Strzok I think, were just unconscionable."
2018-02-06,Breitbart,Sarah Sanders I Dont Really Care What Sen Flake Has to Say,"I dont really care what Sen. Flake has to say, I dont think his constituents do either, Sanders replied. I think thats why his numbers are in his tank.

Flake criticized Trump for suggesting that Democrats were guilty of treason for refusing to applaud during the State of the Union address for good economic news.

Sanders said that Trump was clearly joking but warned Democrats about their continued opposition to the presidents agenda.

What I dont understand, what I dont think the country understands, is why Democrats are so upset about lower taxes and higher wages, Sanders continued. Thats something that every American should be celebrating, not crying about, not sitting on their hands for.

Sanders added that Democrats would have to decide whether or not they could celebrate improved economic numbers for Americans, despite their hatred of Trump and his policies.

Do they hate this president more than they love this country? she asked. I hope the answer is no."
2018-07-25,Breitbart,Failed Never Trump Pundits Billionaire Running Ads Attacking Trumps Popular Tariffs,"A new organization known as Republicans Fighting Tariffs was solely created to attack Trumps tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and portray the Republican Party as one united for free trade absolutism.

The groups website features a quote from Never Trump Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE):

The groups latest ad features a speech by former President Ronald Reagan where he blasts tariffs in favor of free trade. Unmentioned in the ad is how Reagan imposed tariffs on Canadian lumber and put restraints on imported steel and foreign cars to aid American industry. Reagan also put quotas on imported sugar and machine tools from South Korea.

Nonetheless, the Republicans Fighting Tariffs ad attacks Trumps tariffs by selectively featuring Reagans pro-free trade speech where he says Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies, they are our allies.

Also unmentioned by the group is how free trade with China, since 2001, has cost millions of Americans their jobs. For example, in a report by the Economic Policy Institute, between 2001 and 2015, about 3.4 million U.S. jobs were lost due to the countrys trade deficit with China.

Of the 3.4 million U.S. jobs lost in that time period, about 2.6 million were lost in the crippled manufacturing industry, making up about three-fourths of the loss of jobs from the U.S.-Chinese trade deficit.

Funded and Fronted by Never Trump

The Republicans Fighting Tariffs organization has a paper trail that leads back to one of the largest donors to the failed Never Trump movement, eBay Chairman and billionaire Pierre Omidyar.

Republicans Fighting Tariffs is a project of the group, Defending Democracy Together, which receives most of its funding from Omidyar through his organization, Democracy Fund Voice.

This year, Omidyars Democracy Fund Voice awarded Defending Democracy Together $500,000 and another grant of up to $100,000. That money was then used to prop up Defending Democracy Togethers project organization, Republicans Fighting Tariffs.

In 2016, Omidyar funneled $250,000 into the NeverTrump PAC that was set up to stop Trump from becoming president and implementing his America First agenda.

Behind Republicans Fighting Tariffs is a slew of Never Trump pundits, including Bill Kristol and Mona Charen. Kristol and Charen, along with a few other conservative beltway types, head up Defending Democracy Together. Charen signed the Never Trump edition of National Review in early 2016.

Kristol, part of the neoconservative political apparatus, has used his Twitter to push the attack ads on Trumps steel and aluminum tariffs.

Meanwhile, Charen swept headlines this year at CPAC when she attacked not only Trump, but also French populist-nationalist firebrand Marion Marechal-Le Pen, who spoke at the event in support of the president and his pro-American immigration agenda.

Im actually going to twist this around a bit and say that Im disappointed in people on our side for being hypocrites about sexual harassers and abusers of women who are in our party, who are sitting in the White House, who brag about their extramarital affairs, who brag about mistreating women, Charen said at CPAC in February.

Though Republicans Fighting Tariffs claims to represent GOP sentiment on the issue of trade, the vast majority of Republican voters and conservatives have continuously told pollsters that they support Trumps tariffs.

In the latest Harvard/Harris Poll, 83 percent of Republican voters say they support tariffs on imported products like automobiles and electronics. Additionally, 81 percent of conservatives said they too supported tariffs, along with 61 percent of Americans living in rural communities.

Likewise, polling from the latest Morning Consult survey found a similar result. About 65 percent of Republican voters said they somewhat or strongly support imposing tariffs on foreign-made goods that compete with goods made in the U.S. Roughly 66 percent of conservatives said the same, while only five percent of Republican voters said they strongly oppose tariffs.

That same Morning Consult poll revealed that Republicans, female and male, and conservatives are the most supportive of tariffs to protect American industries. For example, 46 percent of Republicans, 47 percent of Republican men, 45 percent of conservatives, and 44 percent of Republican women said they support tariffs in order to protect U.S. jobs and industry.

Most recently, Trump said on Twitter, tariffs are the greatest, noting how the trade barrier can be used to effectively negotiate with trading countries. Republicans and conservatives are vastly supportive of using tariffs to negotiate trade.

The Morning Consult poll found that 70 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of conservatives support the threat of tariffs as a necessary tool in negotiating tactics with other countries to reset fairer relations.

American workers have repeatedly praised Trumps tariffs and thanked him personally for ending the promotion of multinational free trade by the U.S."
2018-07-22,Breitbart,Tim Tebow Inspiring Binghamtons Christian Community,"Tims one of those guys, were all rallying behind him, pastor, David Leandre told the Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin. Hes just involved in a lot of really great representations of what Christians need to be. Were really excited about that.

Leandre added that Tebow is exactly the sort of man he can feel comfortable pointing out to his own son.

Whats really nice is Tims a guy who is what you see in the media, Leandre added. His life off the field is the real deal. Thats so refreshing.

Johnson City Rev. Arnie Buehler also notes that Tebow is a perfect focal point to help bridge the gap between the harsh world many local kids experience and an introduction to the faith.

John Widrick, a youth pastor at Calvarys Love Assembly of God in Johnson City, agrees. Tebow has really become a role model for the 100 kids he shepherds.

Theyre looking for something authentic, something real, Widrick said. Hes stood for something that was more than football. Theres an authenticity to him.

Buehler points out that Tebow is the best of both worlds in sports. He does his best and comports himself well on the field, but he is also exemplary in his private life off the field.

[Tebow] has strong beliefs that he lives by. He lets God lead his life. I think thats a huge valuable lesson for the kids to learn, that our lives are not our own, he said. Weve been given this life and the skills to love others.

KC Sawyer, an associate pastor at Oasis Christian Fellowship of Ithaca, also finds Tebow to be a great example of a man who doesnt just give up and quit in disgust.

The biggest thing is hes someone who failed at his primary goal, to be an NFL quarterback, and he didnt give up, he said. Thats a universal message for anyone who has dreams and goals.

Tebow has also become an integral member of the Binghamton community. After signing on with the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, the player has spoken at community groups and taken time to patronize local business establishments. He has not hidden in a motel room somewhere but has reached out to the locals showing that he is happy to be considered a member of the community.

The players faith is also an important focus of his life. And local Christians know that it shows in his actions.

I think Tim Tebows biggest thing is he accepted Christ, and hes showing how that has produced fruit in his life, Sawyer told the paper.

The hero worship is also properly leavened with common sense. Tim Tebow cant save anyone, only Jesus can, Buehler said even as he and others admit that having Tebow around has been a big help to their ministries."
2018-07-18,Breitbart,Kris Kobach Trumps Pro-US Worker Fair Trade Agenda Future of GOP,"During a campaign event with Donald Trump Jr., Kobach praised Trumps fair trade agenda where he has placed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as well as billions of dollars worth of tariffs on Chinese imports.

Kobach said the pro-American worker approach to trade and immigration taken by the Trump administration is the future of the GOP.

Your dad, he broke the blue wall of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and he did it by being the blue-collar billionaire, Kobach said. Youre dad has that magical combination and elements of charisma and the ability to speak to the working man, but I believe that is the future of the Republican Party.

Im trying to do the same thing in Kansas, where we reach out to blue collar workers and say Look, the Republican Party is your natural home, Kobach said. Were the ones protecting your jobs against foreign competition  illegal foreign competition, were the ones who care about making sure the projects get done and the environmentalist wackos dont stop everything like the Keystone XL.

Trump Jr. pushed back against his dads critics on trade  coming from free trader Republicans and Democrats  noting that foreign counties who have had tariffs placed on them by the Trump administration have been taking advantage of us for decades with free trade deals like NAFTA and in the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Were pretending like weve had fair trade for years, we havent had fair trade. By the way, the reason the other side is complaining about it is because they want it to be unfair, Trump Jr. said.

Weve set this precedent where you can take advantage of us. Were not going to do anything about it, Trump Jr. continued. Of course theyre upset. When these people are our allies are complaining about this, so wait, if your relationship with us and our friendship is predicated purely on you taking advantage of us, thats not a friendship.

Kobach has led on a number of issues nationally, most prominently being the voice in support of the Trump administrations decision to include the U.S. citizenship question on the 2020 Census.

The gubernatorial candidate also led the Trump administrations commission on voter fraud, where he is now fighting the ACLU in court over a states right to make voters prove their citizenship before they vote."

Previously, Trump had instructed Bolton to invite Putin to Washington, D.C. in the fall.

The White House postponed Putins invitation after both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan said that the Russian president would not be welcome to address members of Congress.

The Speaker and I have made it clear that Putin will not be welcome up here at the Capitol, McConnell said on Tuesday.

McConnell and Ryan met with Trump on Wednesday to discuss legislative issues and the confirmation of Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh."
2018-07-18,Breitbart,Far-Left Sleeping Giants Demands Twitter Censorship After Founder Matt Rivitz Revealed,"Sleeping Giants, along with other far-left groups like Media Matters for America, aims to drive conservative media off the web through social media campaigns directed at their advertisers. By scaring advertisers with phony allegations of hate and bigotry against conservative media, Sleeping Giants hopes to scare advertising revenue away from targeted websites. The group was founded by Matt Rivitz shortly after President Trump was elected in 2016.

After operating for over a year in anonymity, the founder of the organization was recently outed by a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation, which revealed the founders identity as Matt Rivitz, a San Francisco-based ad executive. Now, Sleeping Giants is frantically demanding that Twitter, their primary social media platform, censor accounts talking about their founder.

Similarly to the organizations bogus allegations of hate against right-wing media, Sleeping Giants are now claiming that one of their detractors is impersonating the organization after they adopted the name Sleeping Giants Exposed. The account shows no signs of impersonating Sleeping Giants  all of the accounts tweets are aimed at criticizing and exposing the far-left group, not mimicking them. The accounts name is also clearly distinct.

Twitter, which together with Google and Facebook were recently called before the House Judiciary Committee to testify on the issue of bias and censorship on the part of social media giants, has not taken any action.

And that's why I use the term that this was nothing short of treasonous. Because it is a betrayal of the nation."" -- @JohnBrennan pic.twitter.com/qckQn71DMB

Tuesday on MSNBCs Morning Joe, former CIA Director John Brennan accused President Donald Trump of treason and leading the United States down a dangerous path by meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

What Mr. Trump did yesterday was to betray the women and men of the FBI, the CIA, the NSA and others and to betray the American public, Brennan stated. And thats why I use the term that this was nothing short of treasonous because it is a betrayal of the nation. He is giving aid and comfort to the enemy."
2018-07-19,Breitbart,George Soros Calls Barack Obama His Greatest Disappointment,"George Soros, an early backer of Barack Obamas 2008 presidential run, described the former president as his greatest disappointment, in an interview with The New York Times published on Tuesday. On the advice of an aide to Soros present during the interview, the open-borders financier made clear his disappointment came on a professional level.

According to Soros, the Democrat lawmaker closed the door on him after winning the White House. He made one phone call thanking me for my support, which was meant to last for five minutes, and I engaged him, and he had to spend another three minutes with me, so I dragged it out to eight minutes, the progressive billionaire recounted to the paper, later adding Obama had a reputation of taking his supporters for granted.

Neera Tanden, head of the left-leaning group Center for American Progress, revealed in a May 2012 email to Hillary Clinton that Soros admitted to her that he regretted supporting Barack Obamas 2008 presidential campaign.

I told him I worked for you in the primaries and he said hes been impressed that he can always call/meet with you on an issue of policy and said he hasnt met with the President ever (though I thought he had), wrote Tanden. He then said he regretted his decision in the primary  he likes to admit mistakes when he makes them and that was one of them.

Soros and Obama eventually got together in New York City after a failed attempt to schedule a White House meeting. Obamas handlers pissed on him, a source close to the progressive billionaire told the New Yorker. He didnt want a fucking thing! He didnt want a state dinner, or a White House partyhe just wanted to be taken seriously.

Despite their frosty relationship, organizations supported by the two men are working together to oppose President Donald Trumps agenda. Organizing for Action, an off-shoot of Barack Obamas first presidential campaign, partnered with the Soros-backed Indivisible Project for online trainings on how to build protest movements in the Trump-era.

Dubbed Indivisible, the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow ex-Democratic aides to channel their post-election heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trumps agenda. They drafted a 26-page protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders, Politico reports.

Even the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition, says the manual, because these actions create the impression that theyre not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents.

Protesters are encouraged to film Republican candidates in hopes they can be portrayed in a negative light. Unfavorable exchanges caught on video can be devastating for GOP members when shared through social media and picked up by local and national media."
2018-05-29,Breitbart,Illegal Aliens Using Minors to Enter US Increased 315 Percent Since Last Year,"In a briefing to the media on Tuesday, White House officials  including President Trumps senior adviser Stephen Miller  revealed that the number of illegal aliens using children to enter the U.S. at the southern border has increased about 315 percent between October 2017 and February 2018.

Through a series of legal loopholes, minors are smuggled through the southern border with illegal aliens posing as family units in order to eventually be released into the country through the Catch and Release program.

Catch and Release allows foreign nationals to be released into the U.S. while they await immigration and asylum hearings through these legal loopholes.

Miller slammed congressional Democrats as the source cause for the immigration loopholes not yet being closed through law, an effort that Trump has called on the Republican-controlled Congress to take up.

For months, as Breitbart Texas reported, illegal border crossings of family units and unaccompanied minor children have skyrocketed.

Miller said the migration patterns from Central America to the U.S. of unaccompanied minors and illegal aliens posing with children as family units are evidence that trafficking organizations are gaming legal loopholes in U.S. immigration law."
2018-06-19,Breitbart,Fox News Exec Rips Seth MacFarlane for Saying Hes Embarrassed By the Networks Border Coverage,"MacFarlane  whose also created and stars in The Orville on Fox TV  chimed in on the border security and immigration policy flap with a reply to liberal blogger, turned CNN talking head Brian Stelter, in which MacFarlane said he is embarrassed to work for Fox.

In other words, MacFarlane tweeted, dont think critically, dont consult multiple news sources, and in general, dont use your brain. Just blindly obey Fox News. This is fringe sh*t, and its business like this that makes me embarrassed to work for this company.

But Fox News vice president Michael Tammero had a searing retort to MacFarlanes attack on his own employers: Yet... NOT quite embarrassed enough to not cash that check ... isnt that right?

MacFarlanes disgust over his association with Fox might soon be coming to an end, though. As The Wrap reported, it seems likely that the producers properties will be sold to Comcast or Disney in the upcoming mega-sale being contemplated by his employers, 21st Century Fox.

Thus far, 21st Century Fox has not replied to MacFarlanes public criticism."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Los Angeles Rams Owe Reggie Bush 125M in Knee Injury Lawsuit,"The St. Louis Post Dispatch was the first to report the verdict. News 4 St. Louis confirmed the development.

Bush, 33, was playing in his tenth NFL season when he suffered a meniscus tear after returning a punt against the Rams while playing for the San Francisco 49ers at the Edward Jones Dome. Bush landed awkwardly after slipping on concrete and was ruled out for the remainder of the season.

The former Heisman Trophy winner played in 13 games the next season for the Buffalo Bills, before calling it quits.

The Rams were ordered to pay $4.95 million in compensatory damages and $7.5 million in punitive damages. Bush previously sued public agencies associated with the dome, but those cases were dismissed last week.

Bush filed the suit in 2016. He referred to the surface surrounding the field at the time as the concrete ring of death.

Cleveland Browns quarterback Josh McCown injured his shoulder after slipping on the same surface a week before Bush took his tumble. The Rams later covered the area with rubber padding.

Bush works as an analyst for NFL Network. He posted a GIF on Twitter of a man smiling after news of the verdict broke."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Police Probe Terror Motive After Tunisian Male Arrested Over Toxic Substances,"The man and his wife, whose nationality was not released, were detained late Tuesday night after officers raided their flat and came across unknown substances that are now being analysed by specialists, Cologne police said in a statement.

We decided to take very swift action to ward off possible danger, police spokesman Andre Fassbender told DPA news agency.

The 29-year-old Tunisian man is suspected of handling toxic substances, police said.

It was not immediately clear if his wife was still in custody on Wednesday.

According to German broadcaster NTV the woman is a German national who recently converted to Islam. She was said to be pregnant.

In a sign of how seriously authorities are taking the case, federal prosecutors have taken over the investigation.

According to DPA, investigators will now be probing whether the suspects were planning an attack.

Police officers, including special forces, were still combing the couples flat on the first floor of a large apartment building on Wednesday morning.

Chemical experts wearing protective were seen removing plastic bags from the scene.

The couples children have been taken into the care of city authorities.

Germany remains on high alert for jihadist attacks after several assaults claimed by the Islamic State group in the country in recent years.

2018-07-13,Breitbart,No Collusion Rosenstein Indicts 12 Russians for Hacking No Americans Involved,"John Podesta, the former chair of Hillary Clintons presidential campaign whose emails were among those hacked and leaked, welcomed the indictments as if they contradicted President Donald Trumps claims about a witch hunt. Yet, ironically, the indictment confirms that there were no Americans involved in either the hacking or the dissemination of the Democrats emails.

The indictment charges twelve Russian nationals for committing federal crimes that were intended to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. All twelve defendants are members of the GRU, a Russian Federation intelligence agency within the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian military. These GRU officers, in their official capacities, engaged in a sustained effort to hack into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, and released that information on the internet under the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 and through another entity.

There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity or knew they were communicating with Russian intelligence officers. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the vote count or changed the outcome of the 2016 election.

Rosenstein said that the Russians who had been indicted had used spearphishing to gain access to Democrats accounts. He did not mention any evidence gathered from the computer servers of the Democratic National Committee, which were never provided.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee who has been one of the foremost proponents of the Russia collusion theory, persisted with his attacks on the president, telling CNNs Wolf Blitzer that the indictments meant that President Trump should back out of a meeting scheduled with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday.

Thus far, none of the indictments by the Department of Justice or Special Counsel Robert Mueller have had anything to do with collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. The most prominent convictions have been for false statements to the FBI.

2018-09-03,Breitbart,Orson Bean 1950s Hollywood Blacklist was No Comparison to Vitriol of Today,"Bean shared his pessimism of Americas future given left-wing ubiquity across the nations colleges and universities. All these kids that are getting brainwashed in college are going to become the CEOs and the mayors of cities and governors and, ultimately, presidents, he predicted. They are what they are because of all of these Marxist professors. The deplorables in flyover country are not going to run for office or become heads of companies, so theyre having an immediate effect by voting, but I dont see in the long range how were going to change this. All of our leaders of industry and politics are of a left-wing bent.

Marlow concurred with Beans dim view of the future, speculating that many young, left-wing executives in their 20s and 30s are controlling advertising decisions at large companies in accordance with an informal political blacklist of persons, businesses, and organizations they view as hostile to left-wing ideology.

Its never been this bad, replied Bean, reflecting on Hollywoods 1950s blacklist and left-wing agitation of the 1960s and 1970s. In days of Hey, hey! LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?, thats nothing compared to the vitriol of today. So people basically shut up, at least until they get into the ballot box. Thats why you cant trust the polls.

Bean explained how the 1950s Hollywood blacklist of communists was actually a reaction to Hollwood communists blacklisting right-wing and non-communist persons in the film-making industry.

Bean recalled, In the fifties, there was the blacklist, the Hollywood Ten. There was something that preceded it, that to my knowledge has never been written about, which was a group of communists in the film industry who were directors, screenwriters, or producers who would only use fellow communists or actors who they hoped they could persuade to become communists in their movies, and there was a lot of bitterness on the part of right-wing actors that they were blacked out of a lot of these movies, and this preceded the left-wing blacklist that happened, because there were these communist directors who were blacklisting not just right-wingers, but non-communists, and out of this came this rage on the part of the right, and they began calling everyone who didnt agree with them a communist.

Bean lamented what he sees as growing political acrimony between Americans, anecdotally illustrating what he said was an earlier era of political comity.

Part of it is learning not to be judgmental, advised Bean. Not to judge people. One of the things Im proudest of, one year on my refrigerator, I taped a Christmas card from the Republican National Committee and seasons greetings from Gus Hall of the American Communist Party. They both stayed up their months and Im proud of it. I dont know,  these days I dont have much hope. Im increasingly devotee of the philosophy of Alfred E. Neuman  the little moron on the cover of Mad magazine  What, me worry? Ive decided not to worry.

Bean contrasted what he described as television programmings contemporary divisiveness with a prior era of fostered unity via the medium.

TV used to bring people together in the days of Kunta Kinte (and Roots), assessed Bean. Now its separating people. Even in sports, if there should be one place where you should forget politics, forget whether youre liberal or conservative, whether you hate Trump of love him, it should be the ballgame. Instead, they have to rear the ugly head of politics into in by kneeling instead of standing. So its all changed, and not for the better.

2018-02-07,Breitbart,CNN DACA Illegal Aliens Promising to Self-Deport if Amnesty Fails,"Alex and Daniela Velez, two illegal alien sisters enrolled in the DACA program, were profiled for a CNN report which revealed how some illegal aliens are planning to leave the U.S. if they do not receive amnesty.

Alex and I are both over this [DACA situation], said Daniela, who is 24-years-old. If DACA ends, I will leave with Alex. I will close my business, leave work and school. Should Alex, who is 19, find herself unprotected, she said she is clear on what her plan will be. I will leave. I will leave America as soon as possible, she said. I want to be able to leave on my terms. Im not going to be waiting for anyone to come for me.

During a press conference with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Mexicos Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Videgaray said his country would benefit greatly from DACA illegal aliens returning home to Mexico, as Newsweek reported:

If young people protected under DACA were to come back to Mexico, that would be a great gain for Mexico and a loss for the United States, Luis Videgaray, Mexicos Foreign Relations Secretary, said in Spanish at a joint news conference in Mexico City with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland. [Emphasis added]

A DACA amnesty would put more citizen children of illegal aliens  known as anchor babies  on federal welfare, as Breitbart News reported, while American taxpayers would be left with a potentially $26 billion bill.

Additionally, about one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid. At the southern border, a DACA amnesty has the potential to trigger a border surge that could triple the number of illegal aliens pouring through the U.S.-Mexico border. Since DACAs inception, more than 2,100 recipients of the program have been kicked off because they were found to either be criminals or gang members. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

2018-06-16,Breitbart,Maher Dismisses Strzok Text to Page About Stopping Trump Presidency It Was to Make the Sex Hotte,"Friday on HBOs Real Time, host Bill Maher reacted to one of the key revelations in the Department of Justice Inspector Generals report, which showed a text exchange between FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page about stopping Donald Trump from becoming president.

Maher insisted Strzok sentiment wasnt serious and that it was to make the sex between the two, who were having an affair, hotter.

[S]o, nobody reads the 500 pages  our side never catches a break! he said. Theyve got this one thing that is a smoking gun-type thing. And this is not just an opinion when its a guy in the FBI in charge of investigations. He wasnt doing that. He was trying to impress the girl he was fucking. Thats all it was. She is saying, Oh my God. Is Trump going to be president? He says, No, Im Captain Save-A-Ho, and I will stop it, baby. It was to make the sex hotter. But that is all they need. That is all the foot in the door they need, and theyre already calling for the Mueller investigation to be shut down because of that."
2018-08-01,Breitbart,Trump I Think Shutdown Over Border A Great Political Thing - It Can Also Happen After Election,"On Wednesdays Rush Limbaugh Show, President Trump stated that a government shutdown over immigration would be a great political thing. And left open the possibility that a shutdown could happen after the election.

Trump said, I say, hey, if you have a shutdown, you have a shutdown. Now, the shutdown can also take place after the election. I happen to think its a great political thing. Because people want border security.

He added, I happen to think its a good thing politically. Im not doing it for politics. Im doing it because its the right thing to do. ... I happen to think that border security would be a good thing before the election. ... I happen to think it would be a good thing to do before. I actually think wed get more and thered be more pressure on the other side. Because were doing it because the Democrats are not giving us the votes."
2018-08-03,Breitbart,Les Moonves Asked Zero Questions About Sex Assault Claims on CBS Earnings Call,"CEO Les Moonves is facing an investigation after the New Yorker magazine published a story last Friday detailing accounts by six women accusing him of sexual misconduct spanning three decades. The allegations include complaints of forced kissing, unwanted sexual advances and career retaliation against women who rebuffed him.

CBS board will keep Moonves in his job while two outside law firms investigate the complaints.

Moonves said Thursday the companys streaming services, including CBS All Access and Showtime, are on track to reach 8 million subscribers by next year. The companys goal was to hit that number in 2020.

In a call with analysts, Moonves expressed confidence about the companys future but did not address the pending investigation and no analysts brought it up during a question-and-answer session.

During the April-to-June quarter net income at CBS jumped to $400 million, or $1.06 per share, from $58 million, or 14 cents per share last year. Adjusted for one-time items, net income was $1.12 per share. Analysts expected $1.10 share, according to FactSet.

Moonves joined CBS in 1995 and quickly climbed the ranks, becoming CEO of CBS Television in 1998 and CEO of the newly created CBS Corp. in 2006 after its split from Viacom. He revived the company with hit shows like NCIS and The Big Bang Theory.

CBS upcoming lineup for the fall season, when the networks debut their high-profile shows, has a mix of renewed hits and reboots, including new versions of Murphy Brown and Magnum P.I. and renewals of The Big Bang Theory and its spinoff Young Sheldon.

CBS said late Wednesday that it has hired two high-profile law firms to investigate the sexual-misconduct claims. Both teams will be led by women. Covington & Burlings investigation will be led by Nancy Kestenbaum, who has led independent investigations of sexual misconduct for private schools Choate Rosemary Hall and The Brearley School. Debevoise & Plimptons investigation will be led by Mary Jo White, former chairwoman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Meanwhile, The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that CBS board members knew several months ago of an investigation by police in Los Angeles into allegations that Moonves had assaulted a woman three decades ago when they both worked at TV studio Lorimar Productions.

No charges were filed, but Moonves revealed the existence of the investigation to a board committee, which hired a law firm to investigate, according to the Times, which cited two unnamed people familiar with the matter. CBS didnt immediately return messages for comment.

As the future of CBS leadership comes into question, CBS is also locked in a court battle with its parent company, National Amusements, which also owns Viacom. CBS fears that the head of National Amusements, Shari Redstone, will try to combine CBS and Viacom.

Under Moonves, New York-based CBS Corp. has resisted because CBS is more profitable and Viacom networks such as Nickelodeon struggle with viewership. CBS has sought to implement a special dividend to reduce National Amusements control of the company. Redstone is challenging that in a Delaware court.

CBS is facing an industry roiled by consolidation. Media companies are combining to better compete against fast-growing internet companies like Netflix and Amazon. AT&T bought Time Warner for $85 billion in June and Disney is in the process of buying Foxs entertainment businesses for $71 billion.

As more people skip traditional cable subscriptions to watch TV online, CBS has pushed into streaming more aggressively than other networks. CBS launched its own service rather than providing shows to outside streaming services such as Netflix or Hulu. It has some shows that are exclusive to the $6-a-month CBS All Access, including Big Brother: Over the Top; The Good Fight, a spinoff of its hit law procedural The Good Wife; and Star Trek: Discovery."
2018-06-18,Breitbart,Kirstjen Nielsen Challenges Cowardly Congress for Failure on Immigration Laws,"Congress and the courts created this problem and Congress alone can fix it, she said after taking the podium at the White House to defend the administrations enforcement of laws pertaining to children detained at the border.

Nielsen was brought in to address White House reporters on Monday, after traveling from New Orleans where she delivered a speech at the National Sheriffs Association.

We have to do our job. We will not apologize for doing our job. We have sworn to do this job, she said at the conference.

The White House press briefing scheduled for 1:15 p.m. was postponed several times on Monday afternoon as reporters grew restless for an administration response to the growing crisis.

After taking the podium, Nielsen squarely challenged Democrats for grandstanding on the issue and accusing the administration of using the children as leverage to get Congress to act.

I say that is a cowardly response, she said. It is clearly within their power to make and change the laws. They should do so.

She also challenged Democrats for attacking law enforcement officials for doing their job to enforce the laws on the books.

We will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States, she said. Those who criticize the enforcement of our laws have offered only one countermeasure. Open borders."
2018-07-04,Breitbart,Major Cities Across US Boost Security for July 4 Celebrations,"In an email statement, Lesley Fulop, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), told Breitbart News:

The men and women of DHS will be working closely with local law enforcement entities across the country to secure a number of high profile events and ensure the safety and security of all those joining in the July 4th celebrations, she added. As always, DHS encourages vigilance by the public to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement.

Echoing other law enforcement entities, the FBI maintains there are no credible threats at this time, 7 News Boston WHDH reports.

The arrest of an al-Qaeda-linked man in Ohio who was planning to carry out terrorist attacks during the birth of America celebrations in Philadelphia has enhanced the level of alert across America.

Unlike previous years, when terrorist organizations like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda urged attacks around July 4, jihadists have been mostly quiet this year.

However, anarchist extremists from the alt-left Antifa organization  who have expressed their utter disdain towards the birth of the United States celebrations on July 4  have been violently agitating the social order in the days leading up to the Independence Day celebrations.

Although there are no specific, credible threats facing the United States at this time, the most recent National Terrorism Advisory System from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which the department confirmed remains in effect, urges Americans to remain vigilant, noting that foreign terrorist organizations are still a menace able to inspire, enable, and direct individuals inside the U.S. to carry out terror attacks.

Authorities in some of the most prominent destination for Fourth of July are employing contingency measures to keep Americans safe from any and all terrorists.

Law enforcement in the nations capital, one of the top destination for visitors during Fourth of July, is preparing for all attacks, the local Fox 5 news reports, adding:

As hundreds of thousands of people prepare to descend on the National Mall for Independence Day celebrations, the city is not taking any chances. With packed crowds, keeping all of the tourists and spectators safe is no easy feat, especially in an ever-changing security landscape. DC police chief Peter Newsham says his department is being proactive  addressing threats both large and small. Officials say theyre preparing for a wide variety of potential attacks. In DC, visitors should expect increased DC and U.S. Park Police presence to address any and all threats they may encounter, putting both uniformed and plain-clothes officers patrolling the crowds.

 Theres a robust security footprint in addition to personnel, which includes 18,000 feet of fencing and multiple security checkpoints.

Acknowledging that it is working with federal authorities, the New York Police Department announced on Monday:

The NYPD has instituted a comprehensive security plan in preparation for Fourth of July celebrations. Although there is no specific credible terror threat, all precautions are being taken to ensure the safety of the millions of anticipated spectators. More than 6,000 uniformed and plainclothes officers will be deployed to viewing areas along the East River waterfront in Brooklyn and Manhattan for the Macys Fireworks show. Over 100 blocker cars and sand trucks will also be positioned in and around the viewing areas. Counterterrorism and K9 officers will be deployed throughout the city.

Boston is also boosting security in anticipation of Fourth of July, 7 News Boston WHDH notes, adding, With hundreds of thousands of people expected to line the banks of the Charles River to ring in the Fourth of July, Boston officials plan to step up security. Boston police will be out in full force with both uniformed and plain-clothes officers on hand.

In Florida, ABC 7 WWSB reports that law enforcement is vigilante in response to the thwarted July 4 attack in Ohio, noting:

Security is on the minds of Suncoast [Sarasota] residents who are getting ready to celebrate the nations birthday. This comes after a Cleveland man was arrested after FBI agents say he was planning a terror attack on the city...Law enforcement has been preparing for months and planning how to best protect crowds at each eventThe department plans on having every officer out patrolling for the holiday.

On the West Coast, San Diego is taking additional security measures to make sure the biggest Fourth of July fireworks show on that side of the Mississippi is safe.

Security at the Big Bay Boom, the biggest Fourth of July fireworks show on the West Coast, is the culmination of a years worth of planning. The event is also the biggest day of the year for the San Diego Harbor Police. Many of their tactics are withheld from the public for security purposes, NBC 7 San Diego reports.

We do have additional security measures in place. Many you will not see. You will not know about, Capt. John Forsythe of the San Diego Harbor Police declared."
2018-07-11,Breitbart,Maine Gov Paul LePage Vetoes Ban on Sexual Orientation and Gender Counseling,"Going against the tide of 13 states that now prohibit therapists from exploring  even with children and adolescents  the possible reasons why they are experiencing sexual identity issues, LePage explained in a two-page veto announcement that the bill is bad public policy.

In its Washington Update, Family Research Council (FRC) observed LePage is a trailblazer on the issue of therapy bans.

After watching other legislatures fall like dominoes in the outrageous push to outlaw talk therapy on gender and sex issues, LePage became the first governor on either side to put his foot down, FRC noted.

The governor wrote that mental health professionals are already regulated by licensure requirements, and he rejected the notion that they require regulation beyond what is already mandated.

LePage observed that while he strongly agrees that adolescents should not be physically or mentally abused by adults if they share concerns about their sexuality with them, the bill could open up a mental health professional to a malpractice issue even over a simple conversation about sexual orientation or gender initiated by the patient himself.

This is so broad that licensed professionals would be prohibited from counseling an individual even at the individuals own request. We should not prohibit professionals from counseling an individual even at the individuals own request. We should not prohibit professionals from providing their expertise to those who seek it for their own personal and basic questions such as, How do I deal with these feelings I am experiencing?

LePage also went on to voice his concerns that such a bill might be interpreted as a threat to religious liberty.

Parents have the right to seek counsel and treatment for their children from professionals who do not oppose the parents own religious beliefs, he asserted. Because the standard of practice for these professionals already prohibits any practice or therapy that would amount to physical or mental abuse, what we are really trying to regulate are the private, consultative conversations between a licensed provider and a client.

A recent review of the issue of gender dysphoria in young peoplein the Atlantic highlights this problem when such legislative bans on mental health treatment are lobbied by LGBTQ rights organizations that seem to know little about the psychological development of children:

The Human Rights Campaigns Transgender Children & Youth: Understanding the Basics web page ... asserts that being transgender is not a phase, and trying to dismiss it as such can be harmful during a time when your child most needs support and validation. Similarly, parents who consult the pages tagged transgender youth on GLAADs site will find many articles about supporting young people who come out as trans but little about the complicated diagnostic and developmental questions faced by the parents of a gender-exploring child.

LePage pointed out the irony that a bill he proposed to criminalize female genital mutilation  as specific as it was  could not pass his state legislature, yet lawmakers are concerning themselves about conversations between a young person and a therapist who is already licensed by the state."
2018-07-12,Breitbart,George Lopez Pees on Donald Trumps Hollywood Star,"Surrounded by a handful of friends, Lopez pretended to pee on President Trumps Hollywood Star in Los Angeles Tuesday evening by placing a water bottle near his crotch and pouring the contents onto the plaque while grimacing.

The 57-year-old made headlines in June for selling a jacket with messages that read keep the kids but deport the racist in protest of the Trump administrations zero tolerance immigration policy.

The proceeds from the coat, inspired by first lady Melania Trumps Zara jacket with the slogan I really dont care, do u? allegedly went go to far-left advocacy groups fighting for the rights of illegal aliens in the U.S.

My George Lopez Store will be making these items, money donated to organizations focused on reuniting parents and their children, the comedian wrote on Instagram, featuring a photo of himself with comedian D.L. Hughley donning the jackets.

Before the 2016 presidential election, Lopez said he believed the real estate billionaire had a real chance of winning the White House. Theres enough racists in this country for him to get elected, he told TMZ. Lopez was asked after Trump beat Hillary Clinton whether he would reconsider his hate for the president-elect: Ill give him a chance to suck my ass, the comedian said dismissively.

That same year, Lopez made headlines for sharing a violent illustration depicting Mexican druglord Joaquin El Chapo Guzman holding the head of a decapitated Trump. The meme was captioned: Make America Great Again!

Lopez has been the star of a handful of since-canceled TV programs that have failed to take off past their first few seasons: the late-night talk show Lopez Tonight and sitcoms George Lopez, Saint George, and Lopez."
2018-07-29,Breitbart,Watch Religious Freedom Ambassador Sam Brownback Faith Is a Good Thing,"[Its the] first time this has ever been done and I think we hit a vein, he said at an event on Friday on Capitol Hill hosted by the Committee For Responsible Foreign Policy. Very good commitments here.

More than 80 foreign delegations and religious leaders who work with civil society groups attended the ministerial.

Brownback said for a long time that governments have not known how to deal with religion. They have seen religion as a source of problems, and hope it just goes away. They ask themselves, What do I do here, he said.

A simple answer  religious freedom  you let everyone be free, he told attendees. Faith is a good thing.

The event came at the end of a three-day conference hosted by the State Department to advocate for religious freedom around the world and  attended by officials, lawmakers, scholars, humanitarian experts, and other stakeholders.

Brownback said he hoped to do more such conferences to keep the momentum going.

Lets do one of these in Indonesia or Bahrain or Denmark or Argentina. Lets have civil society groups and be part of that, he said.

He acknowledged that efforts to promote religious freedom would be different in each country. However, he said it is not about promoting any one religion  it is protecting the right to religious freedom.

Its about freedom [and] protecting the right to religious freedom. You dont pick a winner or loser.

He said there was a need for more members of the foreign policy establishment to buy into the notion of religious freedom and said he urged his staff not to take a week off after the conference.

We busted through the gate, busted the barrier down, but now you got to keep running, he said. Were at a moment that the iron curtain comes down."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,Asylum Seeker Raped Disabled Belgian Woman for Three Days Hoping for Anchor Baby,"The migrant, named Karim, met with the 19-year-old girl in November 2014 in the city of Liege and held her for three days at a squat where he was living, raping her repeatedly, Belgian newspaper La Derniere Heure reports.

The mother of the girl, who despite being 19 is said to have a mental capacity equal to a seven or eight-year-old child, told the court that 30-year-old Karim wanted to get the girl pregnant as he had previously been deported from the country and banned from living there for six years.

Karim actively prevented the girl from using any sort of contraception and accompanied her to a medical clinic to see if she had become pregnant, the victims mother said in testimony.

The victim claimed that Karim had threatened her and beaten her while raping her to the point where she bled; he also forced her to take sleeping pills.

The asylum seeker has denied the charges against him saying that a mutual acquaintance had been the actual perpetrator and that he had been set up in a revenge plot.

The case echoes other similar attacks across Europe in recent years. In September 2016, outraged residents in the Swedish town of Visby took to the streets in protest after it was revealed that a group of five asylum seekers had raped a wheelchair-bound woman and were released from custody only days later.

In April 2017, an 18-year-old Somali migrant in the German town of Neuenhaus was charged with raping a paralysed 59-year-old man after breaking into a care home. He then raped a second man in another room and killed the mans 87-year-old wife because she had witnessed the assault."
2018-07-22,Breitbart,Dan Coats Admittedly Awkward Comments on Helsinki Summit not Criticism of Trump,"During a fireside chat at the Aspen Security Forum Thursday, Coats was left confounded after NBC anchor Andrea Mitchell first notified him of Putin receiving an invitation to Washington, D.C. Say that again, Coats said, cupping his hand over his ear on live television. He took a deep breath and continued: OK. Thats going to be special.

Coats also revealed in the interview with Mitchell that he was unaware of what transpired in the private meeting between President Trump and Putin in Helsinki, and restated without equivocation his belief that Russia continues to pose a threat to the American electoral system. Basically, they are the ones that are trying to undermine our basic values and divide with our allies, Coats said of Russia. They are the ones who are trying to wreak havoc over our election process.

Coats, who oversees the nations 17 intelligence agencies, also said that if he had been asked, he would have advised President Trump against meeting Putin alone, with just interpreters. Thats not my role. Thats not my job. It is what it is, he said.

Walking back his statements about President Trump, Coats said they were not intended to be critical of the decision to invite Putin to a meeting in Washington later this year. Some press coverage has mischaracterized my intentions in responding to breaking news presented to me during a live interview, Coats said. My admittedly awkward response was in no way meant to be disrespectful or criticize the actions of the president.

I and the entire intel[ligence] community are committed to providing the best possible intelligence to inform and support President Trumps ongoing efforts to prevent Russian meddling in our upcoming elections, to build strong relationships internationally in order to maintain peace, denuclearize dangerous regimes and protect our nation and our allies, Coats added. The statement does not include a formal apology to President Trump.

2018-07-05,Breitbart,Rap Sheet 133 Acts of Media-Approved Violence and Harassment Against Trump Supporters,"It is open season on Trump supporters, and the media is only fomenting, encouraging, excusing, and hoping for more... The media are now openly calling Trump supporters Nazis and are blaming Trump for a mass murder he had nothing to do with. This, of course, is a form of harassment because it incites and justifies mob violence.

Here is the list, so far, and remember that if any one of these things happened to a Democrat, the media would use the story to blot out the sun for weeks. But what we have when it comes to Trump supporters is a media eager to normalize harassment and violence.

2018-07-30,Breitbart,ESPNs Jalen Rose Make America Great Again Americas Pastime Both Dog Whistles,"Monday while discussing athletes having old, racist and anti-gay tweets surface, former NBA star and ESPN Get Up co-host Jalen Rose listed off Make America Great Again and Americas pastime as dog whistles in todays society.

The trend besides the fact that all of these are white American men, that most likely grew up in the United States, literally, the offenses of the tweets actually were similar in either they offended gays or they were anti-racial sentiments towards minorities, in particular blacks, Rose said. When I see the trend, and I understand certain terms have been used as dog whistles in our society: Make America Great Again, Americas pastime. And a lot of times that gets overblown, that gets overlooked. And I dont care that somebody is only quote-unquote 17 years old."
2018-06-15,Breitbart,Blue State Blues Democrats Go All-in for Nancy Pelosi,"On the one hand, they have won special elections for Congress by running candidates who pledge not to vote for Pelosi as Speaker of the House.

On the other hand, they happily spend the millions that Pelosi raises for them, and quietly endorse her campaign to win back the Speakers gavel she lost when voters tossed them out in the 2010 election.

This week, that endorsement was no longer quiet. Californias Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, the heir apparent to Jerry Brown as governor, and the former mayor of Pelosis adopted hometown of San Francisco, publicly declared his loyalty to Pelosi on Wednesday. We must put Nancy Pelosi back in the speakership, he declared, as he accepted Browns endorsement at a unity rally at Democratic Party headquarters in Sacramento.

Newsom backed Pelosi in a week when she reminded voters just how partisan she is. She blasted the good news about the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, and trashed President Donald Trump for his North Korean summit. She also called for uprisings all over the country to protest the administrations policies on immigration.

It is true that Democrats have few other alternatives. The party lacks new leaders  thanks, in part, to Pelosi boxing them out. A report this week in The Hill detailed the frustration felt by many Democrats, quoting one strategist who wants Barack Obama to return to the fray, even at the risk of motivating Republicans to vote: Theres fing no one else ... Bill Clinton is toxic, [former President] Carter is too old, and theres no one else around for miles.

But Newsoms endorsement means that Democrats can no longer pretend they are simply stuck with Pelosi. He did not have to back her: he is running for state, not federal, office (though presidential ambitions certainly beckon).

The progressive wing of the party, to which Newsom is loosely linked, would certainly have forgiven him. He has earned the support of the Berniecrats through his support for gay rights, gun control, and single-payer health care.

And more leftists are starting to see Pelosi as an obstacle, not a friend. Last year, amnesty activists disrupted a Pelosi press conference in San Francisco and accused her of selling out by focusing on the Dreamers. Pelosi has also disappointed the left by trying to suppress talk of impeachment.

Even as left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer has spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising to promote impeachment, Pelosi has made it clear that she does not support the idea  at least not until after Democrats are in control. It seems Newson could easily have snubbed her.

Moderates  those few that are left in the Democratic Party  would also have applauded had Newsom chosen to reject Pelosi in favor of a leader who is not promising to raise taxes and stop the roaring Trump economy.

But Newsom threw in with Pelosi. He put her on the November ballot  and not just in her San Francisco district.

Pelosis friends in the mainstream media have done a good job of whitewashing her past and re-casting her as the master tactician who, at 78, has led her party to defeat and yet survived.

Few today remember that after promising to drain the swamp in 2006, Pelosi backed the corrupt Rep. Jack Murtha (D-PA) as her deputy. Few remember how she centralized power, and said Congress had to pass Obamacare so voters could found out what is in it.

Democrats hope that amnesia continues. Special elections aside, they are all in for Nancy Pelosi.

2018-06-12,Breitbart,Pat Buchanan Trump Bringing End of the New World Order with Populist Defense Trade Agenda,"In an interview with talk radio host Laura Ingraham, Buchanan said Trumps latest moves at the G7 Summit  where he blasted foreign leaders defense and trade policies for draining the U.S.  were the beginning of the end for a world order propped up by globalist free trade and defense efforts.

Whats really going on is the end of the old world order from which the United States has benefited least in the sense that we have contributed more to the defense of the West, defense of Europe, defense of the world during the Cold War and beyond than any other nation. At the same time, weve been running trade deficits in goods at $800 billion a year, which is a tremendous deal for those who are being defended and protected and who are dumping more into the United States than were allowed to sell into their markets. [Emphasis added] I think, Laura, were seeing the end of  if you will  the end of the New World Order that began in say 1991, 1992 after the Cold War was over when we started moving in this direction. [Emphasis added] And I think thats whats behind all this acrimony and the frustration and anger at the President of the United States. [Trump] realizes what a deal the world is getting at our expense and he wants to correct it and the world likes it as it is. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart Newss John Carney reported, Trump concluded his trip to the G7 Summit by noting that his fair trade agenda  where he has enacted pro-American aluminum and steel tariffs as well as a plan to put tariffs on Chinese goods  would not stop until the U.S. is no longer taken advantage of.

Were like the piggy bank that everybodys robbing, and that ends, Trump said in a statement.

I blame our leaders and I congratulate leaders of other countries for taking advantage of our leaders, Trump said. Its going to stop. Or well stop trading with them. And thats a very profitable answer, if we have to do it.

As Breitbart News chronicled, the majority of likely Republican voters say that free trade has hurt the United States and led to mass layoffs of American workers. A majority of black Americans also say that free trade leads to Americans losing their jobs.

A poll noted by Breitbart Newss Sean Moran found that Trumps tariffs on aluminum and steel are supported by 70 percent of Republican voters.

Since 2001, free trade with China has cost millions of Americans their jobs, as Breitbart News noted. Of the 3.4 million U.S. jobs lost in that time period, about 2.6 million were lost in the crippled manufacturing industry, making up about three-fourths of the loss of jobs from the U.S.-Chinese trade deficit."
2018-07-30,Breitbart,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tells Dearborn Voters She Needs Posse to Throw Down in Congress,"Appearing alongside Womens March co-founder Linda Sarsour and Democrat Michigan gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed, Ocasio-Cortez urged attendees of the My Muslim Vote rally in Dearborn, Michigan, to send ex-Democrat State Rep. Rashida Tlaib and community organizer Fayrouz Saad to Congress.

Just fighting against hate is not good enough. We have to [inaudible] and move forward. We have to move in an affirmative direction. I cant do it alone, Ocasio-Cortez began. Just one seat out of 435 isnt whats going to get us there.

I need you to send Fayrouz with me. I need you to send Rashida with me. I need you to lock those doors and send us all. 2018 is the year we get our first Muslim woman to Congress, its that we get our first class of Muslims women to Congress, she added. I need you to send them with me because when we roll through as a posse, we can throw down. We can get it done. Thats how we do it in the Bronx. Roll deep, as they say.

This is a movement, said Ocasio-Cortez . This is a progressive movement. I see his success as my success and vise versa. Thats what were here to show people. That politics isnt a zero-sum game, that we can all win together.

Sarsour introduced Ocasio-Cortez to the crowd, lauding her as the best and brightest of the far-left progressive movement, citing her defeat of ten-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) as an inspiration for the crowd.

Organized by Mpower Change Action, #MyMuslimVote bills itself as a non-partisan voter education and civic engagement campaign, aimed at registering and mobilizing American Muslim voters. Earlier Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez and Sarsour appeared at the 16th Annual Universal Muslim Association of America (UMAA) to speak about how communities guided by a moral company can bring power change to Americas political process.

Following her primary victory, Ocasio-Cortez has been crisscrossing the country in support of progressive Democrat candidates. Ocasio-Cortez recently appeared alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in Kansas City to rally for Brent Welder, a progressive political operative running against running again Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-KS).

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez recently lavished praised on Ocasio-Cortez in an interview with progressive radio host Bill Press, dubbing her the future of our party. The Bronx native-turned-Westchester political upstart is a dues-paying member of Democratic Socialists of Americas New York City chapter. The far-left group recently called for both prisons and profit to be abolished.

As Breitbart News previously reported, The candidate has not endorsed or disavowed on those far-left goals, but her campaign platform does call for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), establishing universal guaranteed employment, and single-payer healthcare  i.e., Medicare for all.

A study released Monday estimated that the cost of a Medicare for all program, such as one submitted by Sen. Sanders, would exceed $32 trillion over ten years."
2018-02-06,Breitbart,Exclusive Lindsey Graham Abandoning Obamacare Repeal Biggest Mistake We Could Make in 2018,"Sen. Graham told Breitbart News, If the reports are true that the Republican leadership is abandoning the promise to repeal Obamacare, its a huge mistake not only in the short term, but also the long run. Theres only unpardonable sin in politics, and thats to stop trying to fulfill a promise.

Sen. Graham, along with Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Dean Heller (R-NV) were at the forefront of revived attempts to repeal Obamacare in late 2017. Their Obamacare repeal bill, known as Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson (GCHJ), would repeal Obamacares employer mandate, several Obamacare taxes, and block grant health care to the states so that Republican states can design more conservative alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. Fifteen Republican governors, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, endorsed the legislation. Walker called the bill a winner all the way around.

Graham continued, I dont know if we can get 50 votes for a block grant. I think we can, but I think it is important that we continue to try to repeal Obamacare with a federalist solution, rather than sitting on the sidelines when socialism is taking over. I only ask that Republicans are as determined to repeal as Democrats were to pass it.

There is no bipartisan pathway forward. No Democrat embraces repealing Obamacare. They want to repair it, at best. Almost all Republicans believe that Obamacare should not be repaired, Graham added.

Graham suggested that to facilitate Obamacare repeal, Republicans should pass a budget, with reconciliation instructions, and then pick up what we did last year and have a debate worthy of the Senate.

The South Carolina senator told Breitbart News that the Republican leaderships decision to move away from Obamacare repeal will delight Democrats to the dismay of the Republican base.

Graham explained, I think if Im a Democrat, this is the best news Ive heard since Obamacare was passed. The problem for the public is that Obamacare is collapsing. In my state, were down to one provider. If Republicans believe that all we have to do is repeal the individual mandate, thats pretty naive. So this is great news for Democrats who believe that we should have a single-payer healthcare system.

Sen. Graham told Breitbart News, In October, premiums are going up. Obamacare cannot be fixed. Its going to continue to collapse, and then, we own the outcome. By repealing the individual mandate, which is a step forward in the eyes of the public, we own the issue. We have a responsibility to do something about the collapsing Obamacare system. I believe that were going to get blamed more than Democrats because we stopped trying to repeal Obamacare, and to suggest that we dont own it is just simply politically naive.

Graham continued, It can hurt us in 2018. It can hurt by our base feeling like we betrayed them. It can hurt us from people suffering from Obamacare, like we dont have a solution. It will energize Democrats. It can undercut everything we did on the tax cut side.

Sen. Graham also revealed to Breitbart News that he continues to discuss Obamacare repeal with Vice President Mike Pence, the Heritage Foundation, and outside groups on renewed attempts to repeal the legislation.

Were having discussions with Vice President Pence, with the White House, with conservative groups, Heritage, all kind of groups to come up with a new type of block grants, Graham said.

Sen. Graham added, Come October, the premium increases will take away most of the benefits of the tax cut, and our base is going to be disappointed that we gave up.

Graham argued that giving up on Obamacare repeal before the 2018 midterm elections could be disastrous for Republicans.

Graham told Breitbart News, One of the biggest miscalculations we can make in 2018 is to abandon our efforts to replace Obamacare and it will not hurt us at the ballot box. It will hurt us at the ballot box because most Republicans are going to feel let down. The public is going to see healthcare costs go up and hold us accountable for not trying. This could be the biggest mistake we could make in 2018. If we put it up to vote and we fall short, at least we put people on the record. I cant promise the outcome, and I can promise to fix a system that is collapsing all over the country. I think it will come back to haunt us. It will deflate our base and energize the liberal Democrat base. You will wipe away most of the gains from the tax cuts.

Graham charged, Obamacare was structurally flawed, and I think the block grant is the best path to save health care.

Sen. Graham concluded, I think this is a defining moment for the Republican Party and the Trump presidency."
2018-06-19,Breitbart,Tom Cotton Democrats Legislative Fix Is Child Trafficking Encouragement Act,"This month, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) filed the Keep Families Together Act, legislation that would release all illegal aliens crossing the border with children.

In a statement online, Cotton slammed the Democrats plan to create, effectively, zero border enforcement, noting how it would likely lead to a surge of child trafficking, human smuggling, and endless illegal immigration at the border.

Feinsteins legislation would mandate that all children traveling with illegal alien adults across the border be kept with those border crossers, a plan that would force federal immigration officials to release the border crossing adult-child unit into the interior of the U.S.

President Trump, on the other hand, has asked the Republican-controlled Congress to enact his plan, which would allow border-crossing children to be detained with their guardians and parents for extended periods of time.

This would speed up the asylum and immigration hearing process, and allow the family unit to be deported together back to their native country."
2018-08-30,Breitbart,Bokhari Google Is Trumps Most Dangerous Enemy,"## After criticizing social media platforms for mass-censoring conservatives
and the alternative media earlier this month, President Trump has [turned his
attention to Google.](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/08/28/trump-slams-
google-for-biased-search-results/) Not a moment too soon  of all the
politically biased tech giants, Google is by far the most dangerous.

Trumps critical comments about Google referenced statistics from a
[report](https://pjmedia.com/trending/google-search-results-show-pervasive-
anti-trump-anti-conservative-bias/) in PJ Media which found that a staggering
96 percent of search results for Trump return results from news sites that
are hostile to the President. Breitbart News own
[investigation](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/08/27/report-google-news-
results-overwhelmingly-favors-cnn-excludes-conservative-sources/) found the
same result.

As Google search results are personalized, this wasnt a strictly scientific
study  that would require tests on hundreds, if not thousands of Google
users. But the fact that a  _conservative columnist_ received search results
that were 96 percent liberal should be deeply worrying. If thats what a
conservative with a (presumably) conservative search history sees, what kind
of results are being sent to swing-voters?

The fact that it could be a [problem of all search
engines](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180828/11102240529/conservatives-
stop-crying-wolf-tech-bias-no-one-will-ever-take-you-seriously.shtml), not
just Google, due to the way search algorithms detect trustworthy content is
true, but Google holds a stranglehold on the search market. Its closest
english-language competitor, Bing, holds 7 percent of the market for searches
according to [NetMarketShare](https://netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-
share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22searchEngine%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22searchEnginesDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222017-08%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222018-07%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D).

Another obvious problem with Google search is how its algorithm repeatedly
surfaces information from Wikipedia at the top of search results. Wikipedia is
an online encyclopedia that relies on a mass of anonymous, unaccountable
editors to create its myriad of pages. The encyclopedias citation rules,
which favor academic and establishment media sources while excluding sources
like Breitbart News and the Daily Caller as unreliable inherently favor the
left.

So too does its cabal of unaccountable left-wing editors, who are slowly but
surely turning the purportedly non-partisan encyclopedia into a platform for
anti-Trump propaganda. Wikipedia editors
[recently](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/08/27/wikipedia-president-
trump-advocate-of-neo-nazi-conspiracy-theory/) added Trump to a list of
advocates of the white genocide conspiracy theory following his comments on
the racially motivated murders of white farmers in South Africa. They
[previously](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/06/28/wikipedia-labels-ice-
detention-centers-concentration-camps/) included ICE detention centers on a
Wikipedia list of concentration camps. The result of Googles reliance on a
far-left encyclopedia is that false information  fake news, you could say 
has the potential to reach the top of the search engines results, like the
time when the California GOP were labeled a Nazi party on Wikipedia, a
categorization that [then made its way to
Google.](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/05/31/google-wikipedia-list-
nazism-as-california-gops-top-ideology/)

While Google leaps to address individual scandals like the California GOP,
dont expect any fundamental changes to address bias  the company is
fundamentally hostile to Trump and to Trumpism. After all, this is a company
whose senior management was [on the verge of
tears](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/08/09/rebels-of-google-management-
verge-of-tears-trump-win/) following his election victory. Furthermore, the
company has quite publicly announced their intention to [pour millions of
dollars](https://www.breitbart.com/news/youtube-to-invest-25-mn-to-boost-
trusted-news-sources/) into propping up the legacy media, including direct
funding of far-left anti-Trump publications like Vox.

**Election-swinging power**

If Googles well-documented far-left biases are trickling into its search
algorithm, what is the worst that could happen? If recent research is to be
believed, the worst would be no more election victories for conservative
candidates  _ever._

The research, led by former  _Psychology Today_ editor Dr. Robert Epstein
[shows](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/04/24/exclusive-research-google-
search-manipulation-can-swing-nearly-80-percent-undecided-voters/) that when
presented with negative search results about a candidate, the opinions of
undecided voters shift against that candidate by a staggering 43.4 percent 
enough to swing virtually any election. Epsteins
[earlier](http://aibrt.org/downloads/EPSTEIN_et_al_2017-SUMMARY-
A_Method_for_Detecting_Bias_in_Search_Rankings-
EMBARGOED_until_March_14_2017.pdf) research suggests that Google already
biased its search results towards Hillary Clinton in 2016, shifting up to 2.6
million votes in her favor (just below the margin by which she won the popular
vote).

Googles upper management has, in the past, been
[brazen](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/08/14/4-times-google-was-linked-
directly-to-hillary-clinton/) about its political biases. Eric Schmidt, CEO of
Google parent company Alphabet in 2016, set up a shadowy organization called
The Groundwork aimed at harnessing the expertise of Silicon Valley to put
Hillary Clinton in the White House. In a 2014 email leaked by WikiLeaks,
Clinton campaign manager John Podesta also claimed that Schmidt wanted to be
head outside adviser to the Clinton campaign.

Its impossible to say for sure if Google is deliberately stacking its search
results against Trump. And thats the entire problem  the company is not
currently required to be transparent about its algorithms, whos in charge of
them, and what their biases are. Given the vast power that this company has
accumulated  the power to organize the worlds information, as the
companys own mission statement reads  how can this be allowed to continue?

2018-07-10,Breitbart,Pence Of Course There Is A Plan to Reunite Families We Are Being Careful,"Tuesday on CNNs The Situation Room, Vice President Mike Pence told CNN correspondent Dana Bash that the Trump administration was reuniting migrant children with their parent in a way thats very careful and very thoughtful.

BASH: Lets move on to something else going on and thats at the southern border. It looks like your administration is probably going to miss a court deadline of today to reunite all children under the age of 5 with their parents. If you are going to separate families isnt it your responsibility as the leader of the government, isnt it the administrations responsibility to figure out how to get them back together?

PENCE: Yes. We have been working very diligently in that regard. I think 102 children that were separated from adults of that number, as of todays deadline I believe we will have reunited 54 of those children.

BASH: But that means that over 50 children under the age of 5  you have children, I have a child  are not with their parents. Is that acceptable?

PENCE: Well, not necessarily the case.

BASH: But should even one child under the 5?

PENCE: Well, what we dont ever want to do is return a vulnerable child, age 3 age 4 to someone who may be a threat to them, who may be a human trafficker, who is not their parent. And frankly, the number has  gone down from 102 to somewhere in the 70s through our vetting process. We have actually in this process found that people who represented themselves as parents turned out not to be the parents. We have found out that there were individuals with strong criminal backgrounds that had children with them as they crossed the border.

BASH: But Ron Johnson, the Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the senate, a fellow Republican, he is very upset at your administration. He said, if theyve got a process, not revealing it to me. These are human beings.

PENCE: Well, I spoke to Senator Johnson today and were going to continue to work with members of congress in both parties.

 was there a plan?

PENCE: Of course there is a plan. Look. We have a crisis at our southern border and when people come into the country illegally  as was the case under the Obama administration at times when we prosecute people for entering our country illegally theyre separated from their children for a period of time. Those children are dispatched to relatives or to foster care . We know where they are and theres a plan to reunite them. And do it in a way thats very careful and very thoughtful. But again lets not forget, I was in Central America last week meeting with the presidents of El Salvador and Guatemala and Honduras and I said to them, this exodus must end."
2018-02-09,Breitbart,Senate Votes to Reopen Government Allow Spending Increases House Still Must Pass,"Attempts to avert a shutdown altogether failed when deficit hawk Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) refused to allow a vote to end debate on the funding bill that is also tied to a two-year budget that does little to rein in federal spending. Paul objected to the budgets removal of certain spending caps and its raising of the debt ceiling.

I ran for office because I was very critical of President Obamas trillion-dollar deficits, Paul said on the Senate floor as he unsuccessfully proposed amendments and prevented the Senate from passing the bill by midnight and avoiding a second government shutdown of 2018. Now we have Republicans hand in hand with Democrats offering us trillion-dollar deficits. I cant in all honesty look the other way.

When the Senate reconvened around 1 a.m., it voted 71-28 first to end debate and then passed the bill, which allows for $300 billion dollars in new spending.

The House of Representatives is expected to take up the bill sometime after 3 a.m. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) will likely not be able to count on all Republicans in his conference to vote for the bill, as budget hawks in that body are expected to echo Pauls objections. Ryan may need votes from a number of Democrats, who will be under immense pressure not to vote for a bill that does not provide amnesty to illegal aliens.

Ryan issued a statement commending the Senate after it voted to pass the bill:

I am pleased the Senate took action to move this critical legislation with a big, bipartisan vote. The Bipartisan Budget Act includes vital disaster relief money and funding for community health centers, and it repeals Obamacares destructive Independent Payment Advisory Board. Most importantly, after years of underfunding and budget uncertainty, this agreement fully funds our military at the level requested by Secretary Mattis and our generals. We will finally be able to get our brave men and women in uniform the resources they need to do their jobs safely and efficiently. Now its time for the House to do its job. I hope members on both sides of the aisle will come together and support this bipartisan compromise to keep the government open and ensure our military remains the best in the world.

The new six-week funding bill will keep the government running. Much to the chagrin of open-borders activists, it does not address immigration and will provide no protection for the illegal aliens who are slated to begin losing their Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status on March 8 if the Supreme Court refuses to allow an injunction from a California federal judge to stand.

Some variety of a deal on DACA was portrayed as essential in the debate over the last government shutdown six weeks ago, with the White House and various groupings in the House and Senate proposing different compromises involving amnesty for hundreds of thousands or even millions of illegal aliens.

If the House passes the Senates combined funding bill and budget, the amnesty and border security issues will likely be revisit when it expires March 23."
2018-07-18,Breitbart,New Jersey Father Accused of Killing 4-Month-Old Son Flashes Big Grin in Mugshot,"The New Jersey State Police arrested William Herring, 42, and charged him with the murder of his baby son, four-month-old Hunter Brochhausen, who was found unresponsive on February 14, Fox 5 reported.

Police also charged the childs mother, Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Brianna Brochhausen, with the same charges in the boys death.

The couple explained that they were punishing the child for crying in a Springfield Township motel room by placing him face down on a bed and then piling all the blankets and pillows on top of him. The couple said they then left the room for a smoke break. They later found the child unresponsive and called an ambulance.

The child never recovered from the February 14 incident and was later pronounced dead at a hospital. He was removed from life-support on March 3.

The thoughtless actions of these individuals ended up costing a defenseless four-month-old infant his life, New Jersey State Police Colonel Patrick Callahan said in a Facebook post.

The responsibilities of becoming a new parent can sometimes be overwhelming, Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina added in a press release. Those who find themselves at a point of crisis when caring for a newborn child should know that help is available, and they must seek that help rather than taking actions that might harm their child."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,Luis Gutierrez to Headline San Diego DACA Rally,"Gutierrez will appear at the Defend the Dream rally at San Diego State University with Congressional candidate Ammar Campa-Najjar, who is challenging Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) in the Republican district.

Gutierrez recently endorsed Campa-Najjar, who is of Arab and Latino heritage and worked in former President Barack Obamas administration.

The Illinois Democrat has been so frustrated with his party on the DACA issue that he reportedly threatened to leave the Democratic caucus if his partys leaders cave again to Republicans and support a spending deal without a permanent DACA fix.

Gutierrez recently announced that he will retire from Congress after his term ends to create a new fierce framework for immigrant rights across this country ahead of 2020 and the presidential election. The Illinois Representative said he plans to travel from coast to coast to meet with activists to create a left-wing infrastructure that can effectively fight President Donald Trump in 2020."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,Donald Trump Endorses Two-Year McConnell Schumer Budget Deal,"The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military, he wrote on Twitter. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great.

Trump emphasized a big boost in military spending as a priority, but the bill also includes additional funding for domestic programs requested by the Democrats.

Once the Senate bill passes, it will go to the House of Representatives for a final vote.

Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill! Trump said, urging bi-partisan support for the massive debt increase.

The deal would raise spending by $300 billion over two years  $165 billion for military spending and $131 on domestic programs. The agreement also extends the debt limit until March 2019, well past the midterm elections. It does not include any immigration agreement to give amnesty to DACA recipients.

No one would suggest it is perfect, McConnell said in a statement hailing the deal. But we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the American people.

Schumer agreed: The budget deal doesnt have everything Democrats want; it doesnt have everything the Republicans want, but it has what the American people need, he said in his statement. It shows that bipartisanship still lives in Washington and that both parties can work together to address the issues affecting our nation."
2018-08-04,Breitbart,Dershowitz Manafort Will Probably Be Convicted,"With Paul Manafort's accountants taking the stand, the defense of ""blaming everything on [Rick] Gates is getting tougher and tougher."" - Former Nixon White House Counsel, John Dean https://t.co/zJ39rJ3usd pic.twitter.com/chhiFzwaaG

On Fridays broadcast of CNNs AC360, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz argued that Paul Manafort will probably be convicted.

Dershowitz said, Look, Manafort was smart not waiving venue because hes much better off with Judge Ellis and a Virginia jury than he would be with a judge who revoked his bail in Washington, DC, and a DC jury, which is going to be largely Democrat. And so  but it gives the prosecutions two shots, and its risky on both sides. But in the end, they will probably get a conviction, and probably try very hard to squeeze Manafort. We cant know at this point whether Manafort will, A sing or compose, and B whether hed be pardoned."
2018-06-12,Breitbart,Asian Media Reacts to Trump-Kim Summit,"South Koreas Chosun Ilbo dismissed the Singapore declaration as a vaguely worded agreement that disappointed many who had hoped for a firmer commitment to denuclearization.

Chosun Ilbo said the summit was more about photo ops than serious negotiations, finding little value in Kim Jong-uns loose commitment to work towards denuclearization, with the implication that he will seek mutual disarmament talks rather than unilateral scrapping of his nuclear program.

The South Korean paper added that Trump alarmed South Koreans with his throwaway promise to end joint military exercises.

Korea Joongang Daily was much more optimistic about the historic summit, holding out hope that it was the beginning of a process that could lead to the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. The report emphasized how well Trump and Kim seemed to get along personally and concluded by noting Trump said he would meet many times with Kim in the future.

Another Korea Joongang Daily report focused on the economic changes that could come to North Korea (and, by extension, South Korea) as a result of diplomatic openness and liberalization, quoting experts who expected Kim to pursue the Chinese or Singaporean models of authoritarian pseudo-capitalism.

Korea Joongang Daily was especially intrigued by the keen interest Kim showed in Singapore during his visit. (Anna Fifield of the Washington Post made an interesting observation that Pyongyang media is publishing extensive photo essays of Kim in Singapore, which must be an astonishing sight for North Koreans who can only dream of having reliable electric power.)

In a roundup of North Korean media reactions, KJD highlighted the unprecedented level of coverage given to Kims trip, and the telling detail that North Koreas tightly controlled press suddenly began acknowledging that denuclearization is on the table after the summit ended with smiles all around. During Kims few previous trips beyond North Koreas borders, his media waited to publish stories until he was safely back home.

Japans Mainichi was hopeful that Japanese concerns, especially disclosures about citizens kidnapped by North Korea in decades past, would be addressed during the denuclearization process even though they were not mentioned in the Singapore declaration. The hope is that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe can now hold his own meeting with Kim Jong-un, either in person or through high-level ministers, to address Japans concerns.

The Asahi Shimbun noted that Abe praised the Singapore summit as the first step in a comprehensive resolution. Abe also thanked Trump for raising the abduction issue, which suggests the abductees were discussed to Abes satisfaction even though they were not referenced directly by the post-summit declaration.

Chinas state-run Global Times was pleased with the outcome of the summit, which it described as a step toward regional security that would have been almost unimaginable six months ago. Of course, the Chinese paper detected a certain force behind this historic achievement, and while the editorial is too demure to spell out the name of that force, it certainly isnt emanating from Washington or Pyongyang.

Perhaps the most ominous portent from the Singapore summit is that Chinese media is still hedging its bets instead of openly declaring the affair a towering achievement of diplomacy that would not have been possible without Beijings wise leadership:

This force is the new logic of international politics in the 21st century. This is not an era in which everything is decided by conquest. No matter how powerful a nations military, it cannot solve all the problems concerning its core interests, neither can it create well-being and peace. Mutual respect for others core interest and care for each others major concerns is now at the top of global political rules. From this perspective, we can be more optimistic and confident over the future US-North Korea relations and their outlook of carrying out the agreement. It is rational to think that Washington and Pyongyang will continue to follow the roadmap they outlined today. It is more in line with their interests than turning around halfway or going back to hostilities. To further promote denuclearization on the Peninsula, it is necessary to keep injecting momentum into the process. Boosting North Koreas enthusiasm is crucial. Washington used to be very skeptical about Pyongyang, but this year, North Korea has been very consistent. It has taken unilateral steps to release three US hostages and demolished its nuclear test site. It is time to consider alleviating sanctions against Pyongyang.

The editorial writers of the Chinese Communist Peoples Daily were busy pumping up the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Qingdao as the most important thing going on in the world right now, but the papers news writers oversold the Shanghai summit by announcing Kim agrees with Trump to complete denuclearization in exchange for security guarantees and claiming the Singapore declaration was a comprehensive pact.

The Philippine Star reported that Trump stunned the Korean peninsula by announcing the stoppage of U.S.-South Korean annual war games that have long been defended as defensive and vital by the allies. The Philippine outlet also noted that Asian and European stocks are up following the summit.

Channel News Asia wondered if a Nobel Peace Price could be in the offing for Trump and Kim Jong-un, concluding that the prestigious prize may remain elusive for the duo, even if denuclearization is achieved.

A roundup of analysts by Channel News Asia found much skepticism that North Koreas nuclear missile program will decisively end as a result of the Trump-Kim negotiations, with much attention paid to the lack of the words complete, verifiable, and irreversible in the Singapore declaration.

In Malaysia, which had solid relations with Pyongyang until North Korean agents used a weapon of mass destruction to murder Kim Jong-uns half-brother at the Kuala Lumpur airport, the Straits Times wondered who used the art of the deal against who in Singapore.

On the other hand, Trump was praised for understanding better than previous American presidents how much emphasis North Korea puts on personal exchanges between national leaders, and how its paranoia about regime change must be addressed by recognizing the legitimacy of its government before negotiations can move forward.

In Guam, frequently threatened with destruction by North Korea because of the U.S. bombers based there, the editors of the Pacific Daily News hoped for the best and expressed relief that cooler heads and kinder words appear to be prevailing."
2018-07-23,Breitbart,Exclusive Kevin McCarthy on Border Wall Funding We Must Finish the Job,"Reacting during an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel to news that the House has secured an additional $5.5 billion for the border wall, McCarthy says the president is thrilled.

I have worked very closely with the president on this, McCarthy says. We are already building part of the wall now in California. Weve got to continue that and finish the job. And weve gotten, when they requested, about $1.2 or $1.6 billion already appropriated for that. And then the next appropriation process were going right now we just put in $5 billion. The president was very excited about thatI talked to him [on Wednesday]. So were going to bring that to the floor and get that moving and get the funding going.

When the news broke that the House was including the $5 billion extra in funding for the wall in its latest appropriations bill, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement expressing strong administration support for the funding. Sanders said:

The Administration strongly supports the inclusion of $5 billion for border wall construction and associated technology in the Homeland Security appropriations bill recently introduced in the House of Representatives. This funding is critical to the Administrations top priority, securing the Nations borders. It will enable the construction of over 200 miles of new physical barrier along the Southern border, including associated surveillance technology and access roads. These investments are essential to deterring, preventing, and denying illegal border crossings by would-be illegal immigrants, human traffickers, criminal aliens, child smugglers, and drug dealers."
2018-06-13,Breitbart,WATCH - Giuliani Palestinian Authority Not Entitled to Be a State,"In a series of scathing interviews with Israeli media outlets this week while on a visit to the country, the combative former mayor of New York City took the PA to task for supporting terrorism.

The PA, Giuliani told the Jerusalem Post, has to show it can get control of terrorism. It has to end. It has to show that it can put together a responsible government that will act on behalf of the people and not steal them blind.

According to Giuliani, except for some left-wing political contingents, no one in the US has any use for the Palestinian Authority. We are aware of the fact that they pay salaries to convicted terrorists, including people convicted of killing Americans. That is totally mind-boggling.

In a separate interview with Israeli watchdog Palestinian Media Watch, Giuliani said that the pay-for-slay scheme was proof of the PAs endorsement of terror.

The payment of money by the Palestinian Authority to terrorists who are convicted of terrorism is an absolute human rights outrage and a crime in and of itself. To give money to people who slaughter innocent human beings, including children and women and innocent people of all kinds, is a direct contribution to terrorism, he said.

The fact that the Palestinian Authority does this, carries this out on a massive scale, is yet another indication that the Palestinian Authority is a prime supporter of terrorism, and therefore not entitled to be a state.

Giuliani called the PA a murder machine for its indoctrination of Palestinian children, using textbooks to incite to kill Israelis.

He also slammed the recent decision by Argentina to cancel a soccer match in Jerusalem as outrageous.

Argentinean players received death threats from supporters of the Palestinians warning them not to play in the contested capital and the game was ultimately cancelled.

You should never succumb to fear induced by terrorists, Giuliani told the Jerusalem Post.

You dont let terrorism frighten you into not doing what you already agreed to do, he said. Had they not agreed to it in the first place, it would be one thing; but having agreed to it, you have to have the courage to go through with it.

Moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem last month, he said, was important for the same reason it would have been important for Argentina to go through with this game. There was only one reason not to move the embassy: fear. America, the greatest military power on earth, should not be affected by fear."
2018-07-03,Breitbart,President Trump EU Possibly Bad as China on Trade Just Smaller,"Bartiromo asked President Trump if the U.S. should be banding with allies like the European Union to try to stop China from stealing from the U.S.

The European Union is possibly as bad as China, just smaller, President Trump replied to Bartiromo. Its terrible what they do to us.

European Union, take a look at the car situation, he went on. They send their Mercedes in, we cant send our cars in.

Look what they do to our farmers, Trump urged. They dont want our farm products. Now in all fairness they have their farmers. So they want to protect their farmers. But we dont protect ours and they protect theirs.

The European Union last year made, if you look at a trade surplus, which I think is a very important thing, a hundred and fifty one billion dollars, emphasized Trump.

Trump went on to say we also love the European Union and point out that his parents were born within the area now encompassed by the European Union, before those countries were a part of the European Union. I love those countries, said Trump, naming Germany and Scotland. Theyre still hangin in there, right? Well see what happens with Brexit, he said.

But they treat us very badly. They treat us very unfairly, Trump said qualifying his remarks. They made last year 151 billion dollars in trade surplus. In other words, we had a deficit with the European Union. On top of that we spend a fortune on NATO to protect them.

Top German auto makers have called for an end all tariffs on automobiles, both the 10 percent tariffs the European Union imposes on autos from the U.S. and other countries and the 2.5 percent that the U.S. currently imposes on EU vehicle exports to the U.S."
2018-07-05,Breitbart,Report Mueller Adding More Resources to His 17M Russia Meddling and Collusion Probe,"Bloomberg News reported Thursday that Mueller is tapping more FBI agents, in addition to career prosecutors, to work on the probe.

The total cost for the probe in its first ten months has been $16.7 million, or an average of $1.67 million per month. According to that monthly average, the cost to date could now be more than $20 million.

U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill, paying for the salaries and benefits of the lawyers, their travel and transportation while working on the probe, any contracted services such as IT support, equipment, and other expenditures.

Mueller requested the help of four more prosecutors in May and June, in addition to his 17-lawyer team.

Those lawyers are Uzo Asonye from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Jonathan Kravis, Deborah Curtis, and Kathryn Rakoczky, from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia.

Investigators in New York and Pittsburgh have also been tapped to supplement Muellers team.

According to Bloomberg, the additional resources could be a sign Mueller plans to pass off parts of his investigation to those prosecutors eventually. For example, Mueller handed off the investigation into Trumps personal lawyer Michael Cohen to the Southern District of New York.

But the assignments also could be in response to legal challenges to his indictments, Bloomberg reported. Manafort, who has been charged with financial crimes that pre-dated his work on the Trump campaign, has been fighting the charges in two federal courthouses, and recently expanded his case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

A Russian company, Concord Management and Consulting, LLC, Mueller indicted in February is also fighting charges on violating criminal laws with the intent to interfere with the 2016 election.

And a former Roger Stone adviser, Andrew Miller, has also filed a sealed motion to fight one of Mullers grand jury subpoenas.

Asonye has been assigned to United States of America versus Paul J. Manafort, Jr. Kravis, Curtis, and Rakoczky are assigned to United States of America versus Concord Management and Consulting, LLC.

The assignments do not increase the size of Muellers 17-person team, but increases DOJ costs dedicated to the probe.

In fact, in the first ten months of the probe, costs for the DOJ  $9 million  have outpaced the cost of Muellers dedicated team, at $7.7 million.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, has allowed him to investigate any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation in addition to whether Trump and any associates colluded with Russia."
2018-02-08,Breitbart,Womens March Co-Founder Perez at DACA Rally We Are All American Citizens Some of Us Didnt Cross,"We are all American citizens, Perez said. Some of us didnt cross the border  the border crossed us.

Perez and others at the rally, branded A Day of Action Against Trumps White Supremacy, made it clear they rejected President Donald Trumps immigration plan for amnesty for 1.8 million illegal aliens and want it for all of the estimated 11 million who are living here.

Xenophobia impacts immigrants from every continent and never limit yourself, or ourselves, or our reach, or our influence, or our activism based on the borders and barriers that others force upon us, Perez said. Because no human being is illegal.

Cristina Jimenez, executive director and co-founder of United We Dream, which sponsored the event along with the Womens March and other left-wing groups, said that amnesty should be for all of the 11 million illegal aliens living in the United States.

We are here for them all, Jimenez said.

The rally advertisement on the United We Dream website blames Trump for the immigration debacle, even though he gave Congress months to come up with a legislative solution before the expiration of the DACA program in March and conceded more to DACA recipients than the much tougher House bill, which would provide amnesty only to DACA recipients.

From day one, Trumps anti-immigrant agenda has ripped families apart, the announcement said. His latest proposal, crafted by political adviser Stephen Miller, pits immigrant youth against their parents, their family members, and other immigrant community members.

The other groups sponsoring the rally include Good Jobs Nation, iAmerica Action, Bend the Arc Jewish Action, Center for Popular Democracy, United We Dream, National Domestic Workers Alliance, CASA, Make the Road New York, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Right, and Credo Mobile."
2018-07-08,Breitbart,England New Female Genital Mutilation Case Every Two Hours Experts Demand Action,"Between April 2017 and March 2018, around 6,200 women and girls who visited a doctor, midwife, or other public health services in England had been exposed to the form of abuse at some point, the National Health Service (NHS) said on Thursday.

Some cases had already been recorded, but 4,495 were being logged for the first time since the government made it compulsory for medical practitioners to report cases of FGM in 2015.

Since then, there have been 28,326 medical attendances of females with FGM and 16,265 newly recorded cases. However, an estimated 137,000 women and girls in England and Wales have been exposed to the practice overall.

In the past 12 months, nearly half (2,755) of the attendance cases were in London, 1,415 were in the north of England, 1,200 in the Midlands and East, and 745 in the south of England.

Of the cases where both the age of the victim and the place of birth could be determined, 86 percent of the women and girls were born and had FGM undertaken in an African country, the NHS added in a report.

FGM has been a criminal offence in Britain since 1985, and since 2003 it has been illegal for British citizens to carry out or procure FGM abroad  but police and prosecutors are yet to secure a single conviction, with the National Police Chiefs Council FGM lead describing the crime as nuanced.

In response to the new NHS data, the National FGM Centre, run by Barnardos childrens charity and the Local Government Association, called for more to be done to support survivors and protect girls at risk from the practice.

The organisations head, Leethen Bartholomew, said: Shockingly, todays figures confirm that dozens of women and girls born in the UK have undergone FGM, despite the practice being illegal for over 30 years.

Yet there still hasnt been a single successful prosecution to hold perpetrators to account. FGM is child abuse and its vital that we work with affected communities to change hearts and minds about the practice.

Agencies must also work better together to prosecute those who fail to protect girls from this type of abuse.

Hemraj Goyal Foundation director Anita Goyal said: No child should have to suffer from any form of violence.

She added: While school teachers now are given training in how to identify and handle cases of FGM and honour abuse, historically this was not the case.

As a former teacher at a secondary school in Romford, I remember how the subject of FGM and other honour abuse was seen as a taboo, with little to no knowledge in the school about how to handle such cases."
2018-02-05,Breitbart,Report Intel Agencies May Hold Back Information from Congress in Wake of House Memo on FBI Surveill,"The GOP-produced memo released last week contends that when the FBI asked a secret court for a warrant to do surveillance on a former associate in then-candidate Donald Trumps campaign, the bureau relied too heavily on a dossier compiled by an ex-British spy whose opposition research was funded by Democrats.

Critics accuse Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., of abusing his power as chairman of the House intelligence committee to do the presidents bidding and undermine the investigation into whether any Trump campaign associates colluded with Russian during the 2016 election. His office rebuts that claim, saying the real abuse of power was using unverified information bought and paid for by one political campaign to justify government surveillance of former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

This isnt the first time intelligence has been politicized. Both Democrats and Republicans used the release of the so-called torture report in late 2015 outlining the CIAs detention and interrogation program as political ammunition. In the 1960s, while intelligence agencies warned that the Vietnam War was being lost, the White House was telling the public the opposite. During the George W. Bush administration, cherry-picked intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction fueled momentum for the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Former CIA Director Mike Hayden worries that the memos release will damage congressional oversight and the effectiveness of law enforcement.

We are chiseling away at processes and institutions on which we currently depend  and on which we will depend in the future, said Hayden, who has worked for both Democratic and Republican administrations.

Hayden, who also directed the National Security Agency, wrote an op-ed in The Cipher Brief, an online newsletter focused on intelligence issues, to urge Justice Department and intelligence professionals to speak out. He wondered, though, if they would, given Trumps penchant for honoring loyalty.

A senior official in justice or a senior official in intelligence needs to say, We need to take a knee here. We need to take a deep breath' Hayden said. What we are now doing is destroying the institutions we need to keep America safe.'

Josh Campbell, a former supervisory special agent with the FBI who investigated counterterrorism, recently resigned to do just that. Partisan attacks undermine the agency and national security, according to Campbell, who said he disagrees with colleagues who advised staying mum until the current controversy passes.

FBI agents are dogged people who do not care about the direction of political winds, Campbell said in an editorial published Feb. 2 in The New York Times. But to succeed in their work, they need public backing. Scorched-earth attacks from politicians with partisan goals now threaten that support, raising corrosive doubts about the integrity of the FBI that could last for generations.

FBI director Christopher Wray and the second-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rod Rosenstein, had urged Trump to keep the memo classified and out of public view, but the president declined. Last week, Trump attacked both agencies through his Twitter account, saying their leadership and investigators had politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans.

Wray has defended the bureau and its agents throughout the memo controversy.

Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, who is a member of the House intelligence committee, said the memo is not a rebuke of the FBI rank-and-file or special counsel Robert Mueller.

The memo is about a process and what kinds of information should be used in order to allow the federal government to spy on Americans, said Hurd, a former covert CIA officer. In my opinion, unverified information, circular reporting and rumors should not be used in an application to spy on American citizens. We should be protecting our civil liberties.

Robert Litt, the former general counsel for the director of national intelligence, said the future relationship between intelligence agencies and their congressional overseers has been put at risk.

The precedent thats been set here is very dangerous, Litt said. You can only imagine if the Democrats get control of the House in the mid-year election; they will now be able to say look, Weve established a precedent here. Youve released classified information, and were going to start doing it as well.'

Democrats have prepared their own memo in response to the one Nunes released last week and have asked the committee to authorize its release.

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said he too fears lawmakers will start seeking to disclose intelligence information in politically biased memos.

Schiff also worries that confidential sources could become more reluctant to provide information to U.S. intelligence agencies for fear that Congress could out them. Moreover, the American public could start wondering whether actions that law enforcement and intelligence agencies take to protect the country will be mischaracterized for political reasons, he said.

The contract between intelligence agencies and the House intelligence committee is broken, he warned.

I have to think that its going to have a chilling effect on what theyre willing to share with us, he said. Its also going to be very demoralizing for people at the FBI to see them being used as a pinata for partisan reasons.

2018-06-19,Breitbart,South Korea Faces Wave of Refugees from Yemen,"The administration of President Moon Jae-in is under enormous pressure to deal with asylum seekers fleeing the horrific civil war in Yemen.

Yemenis have been flooding into the resort island of Jeju after their 90-day permits to stay in Malaysia expire. Malaysia is not a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention, so the Yemenis move on to South Korea when their temporary permits expire.

Under South Korean law, foreigners can seek asylum at air and sea ports, request legal counsel, remain in South Korea until their application for asylum has been adjudicated, and file multiple appeals if their application is rejected. South Korea has actually granted very few requests for asylum to date  only about 800 approvals out of over 32,000 applications filed since 1994.

For the convenience of the resort industry, Jeju allows foreigners to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. The number of Yemeni refugees seeking asylum from Jeju rose from ten in 2016 to at least 500 in just the first half of 2018. The total number of asylum-seekers on the island is now about ten times what it was in 2017.

The South Korean government took its first major step to control the situation in April by refusing to allow asylum-seekers off the island and into mainland South Korea. The refugee pipeline involved arriving in Jeju and then reaching Seoul as quickly as possible, where a growing Yemeni community awaits.

When I submit my application for refugee status, after one week, two weeks, I expect to get permission to go to other place. But I was surprised we cant go any place and cant get any job, cant get any support money. I feel very, very sad, one Yemeni told Korea Expose in June, after flying into Jeju and checking into a hotel with plans to proceed to Seoul.

Yemenis quoted in the article complained they were running out of money and South Korea has not provided food or shelter for them. At least in prison, you get food and a roof over your head. Here its like a prison without anything, one of them said.

The next step for Seoul was taken in May when Yemen was added to the list of countries whose citizens cannot visit Jeju without a visa. Even if that measure proves effective at halting the flow of new arrivals, there are still almost six hundred Yemenis on the island with nowhere else to go.

Under pressure from humanitarian organizations and the United Nations, the provincial government of Jeju announced on Tuesday that it will begin providing aid to the refugees, including financial assistance, training in the Korean language, and job placement, while also assuring the public that order will be maintained.

We will do our best to offer humanitarian assistance to Yemeni asylum seekers and protect the safety of our residents, vice governor Ahn Dong-woo said at a joint press conference with police and immigration officials.

While the self-governing body of the tourism-centric southern island of South Korea held public sessions teaching them Korean and introducing jobs in the local fishing industry, local citizens unhappy about the refugees influx have begun online campaigns demanding authorities rein in the newcomers, the Korea Times explained over the weekend.

According to the Korea Times, a seminar was held on June 14 offering to teach basic Korean to Yemeni refugees interested in working for Jejus fishing industry. The program was looking for 170 workers, but 400 applicants turned up.

Residents of Jeju Island were apprehensive about the provincial governments program to help the refugees, questioning its legality under local ordinances requiring that foreigners cannot be given preference over legal residents for jobs. Also, South Koreas refugee law stipulates that refugees must wait six months before they can apply for employment, a restriction that was waived for the Yemenis on Jeju.

The controversy soon reached South Koreas presidential Blue House, known in Korean as Cheong Wa Dae:

While the island authority was at the frontline of helping the refugees, Korean residents on the island voiced strong opposition. Their fiercest voices appeared on presidential office Cheong Wa Daes website, where petitions appeared calling for the islands lax visa system to be changed and for the inflow of Yemeni refugees to be stopped. Both petitions gained significant support. The first petition titled Let us defy Jeju Island accepting refugees was posted on June 12. The petition, posted anonymously, claimed it was obvious the Yemenis, who see women as not a human but a child-delivering object, will cause sexually explicit crimes. ... Look at the Chinese. The person asked why Koreans should have to put up with foreigners and demanded that legal action be taken immediately before it was too late. The petitions require the central government to make an official reply if they draw 200,000 supporters or more in one month. The June 12 petition attracted more than 180,000 in four days. But the petition was deleted from the site on Saturday without any notice from Cheong Wa Dae, causing an online outcry demanding an explanation. A similar petition posted on the Cheong Wa Dae site on June 13 has drawn more than 160,000 supporters in four days. The post said, Before accepting refugees, the central government must check its priorities list and first resolve the issue about illegal aliens with expired visas.

I have serious doubts over whether granting asylum status and providing livelihood support for them would enhance the security of locals and help the local Jeju economy, the author of the June 13 petition wrote. Korea Joongang Daily reported on Tuesday that the petition has reached 250,000 signatures, easily passing the 200,000 milestone for a response from the Blue House.

The first petition was apparently removed due to intemperate language such as, It is obvious the Yemenis, who see women as not a human but as a child-delivering object, will cause sexually explicit crimes ... just look at the Chinese. This last was a reference to a rash of crimes on Jeju in 2016 that was attributed to Chinese tourists.

The Korea Times adds that civic groups, Christian churches, local businesses, and the Korean Red Cross have been doing what they can to assist the refugees, as in the case of a Jeju hotel that gave refugees a heavily discounted group rate and opened its kitchen so they could prepare halal food.

The Korea Herald reports that local efforts to help the refugees with charitable contributions have been coordinated by a Facebook group called Yemen Refugees in Jeju:

South Koreas National Human Rights Commission has urged the government to do more for Yemeni refugees, citing the extreme hardships they face in Yemen, including disease and malnutrition. Challenges have also been raised to the policy of preventing refugees from leaving Jeju Island, with critics arguing that the island lacks the resources to care for refugees or process their asylum applications efficiently."
2018-07-30,Breitbart,Massive Trump 2020 Banner Unfurled in Yankee Stadium,"The fans unrolled their banner from the stands during the eighth inning in right field, the Daily Wire reported.

No one yet knows how the fans were able to smuggle the huge banner into the stadium, but it is not likely that many of their fellow fans would approve. According to Yahoo Sports, Trump only earned five percent of the vote in the Bronx during the 2016 presidential election.

Naturally, many are wondering if the Russians are involved.

The banner did not seem to perturb the Yankees, in any case. The Yanks beat the Kansas City Royals 6-3."
2018-07-05,Breitbart,Fed Minutes Show Why Officials Are Not Panicked About Trade Wars,"Federal Reserve officials believe that the economy is currently operating well-above its longer-run potential, according to minutes from the most recent meeting of the Feds monetary policymaking committee. Unemployment is lower than Fed leaders and staffers believe is sustainable in the long-run. Economic output is running higher than they think is sustainable.

This raises the specter of inflation or financial imbalances. Some members of the Federal Open Markets Committee expressed concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn, the Fed minutes reported.

But the fears of an overheating economy are getting a reprieve from an unexpected source: trade disputes.

According to the Fed minutes, many of the business contacts of Fed officials expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.

Most participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending, the minutes stated.

In light of an economy that is leaping from strength to strength, this means that trade disputes could wind up keeping the economy on a steady course, avoiding the overheating scenario.

In other words, the economy is doing so well that a bit of trade friction would not be bad. If it ever develops into a drag on the economy, it will simply balance out the boom created by the rise in confidence and the fall in taxes.

Thats a big if. Apart from the anecdotal evidence that trade is creating risks to economic expansion, the actual data show investment is doing very well even while talk of trade wars is rampant.

Here are some data points from the minutes.

That mirrors what Fed chair Jerome Powell said in his press conference last month.

So, right now, we dont see that in the numbers at all. The economy is very strong, the labor market is strong, growth is strong. We really dont see it in the numbers. Its just not there. But  so I  I would put it down as more of a risk, Powell said when asked about trade disputes possibly weighing on the economy

Trumps tax cuts and the current path of spending are supportive of economic growth, according to the Fed minutes.

A bigger concern than trade disputes is the slowdown in Europe and around the world.  Trade disputes are mentioned just four times in the minutes. Europes recent troubles come up six times.

Many participants saw potential downside risks to economic growth and inflation associated with political and economic developments in Europe, and emerging markets."
2018-02-09,Breitbart,He Asked Her to Take Off Her Bra Koch-Backed Cato Institute Hit with Sexual Harassment Claims,"The report details how former Cato Institute President Ed Crane, now 73-years-old, allegedly sexually harassed at least three former employees of the think tank before he left the organization in 2012.

Multiple instances of Cranes alleged sexual harassment are outlined in the report, including one allegation in which a former employee said Crane told her during lunch to go to the bathroom and take her bra off.

 One former Cato employee during the late 1990s recalled visiting Cranes office on multiple occasions and finding him viewing pornography on his computer. On one occasion, Crane told the employee she resembled a woman in one of the pictures and on another occasion told her he would like to see how her breasts measured up to the images on his screen. She said Crane made dozens of sexual comments to her during her time at Cato. She said she complained about Cranes behavior to a senior Cato official, who told her he would raise the matter with Crane. Cranes behavior didnt change, the woman said. The senior official, now retired, did not respond to requests for comment. Crane said, I have no idea what shes talking about. [Emphasis added]  A former research assistant said that shortly after she started working at Cato in 2003, when she was 23 years old, she received a forwarded email from Crane about breast augmentation. Crane added a note to the email suggesting she was not in need of the breast enhancement services, the former research assistant said. Crane responded, I dont remember. I wouldnt do that. [Emphasis added]  Another former Cato employee recalled having lunch with Crane after leaving her job at the organization for another Washington employer in 2004. During the lunch, she said, Crane told her she should go to the bathroom and take her bra off. Within hours, she told a close friend and colleague, who confirmed the incident to POLITICO. Crane did not respond to requests for comment on this incident. [Emphasis added]

In 2012, Crane settled a lawsuit with former Cato employee Carey Lafferty, toward whom he had allegedly made multiple sexual remarks.  Another three former Cato employees said they witnessed Cranes alleged sexual harassment first-hand.

A former male Cato employee told Politico he even witnessed Crane attempting to undo the bra of a female co-worker during a boat Christmas party.

Another instance of Cranes alleged sexual harassment was when a female contractor left Catos boardroom after presenting a project to the organization. A former male employee said after the contractor was out of the room, Crane turned to the boardroom of male colleagues and said: Man, Id love to have her sit on my face.

Crane told Politico that the allegations are ridiculous.

Breitbart News was at the forefront of reporting on Cranes alleged sexual harassing behavior while at the Cato Institute:

In the latest development, perhaps emboldened by the raging shareholder dispute, former staffers of this gold-standard of libertarian think tanks have actively come forward to paint a disturbing picture of the work environment at Cato under Ed Cranes leadership  suggesting that it is, at least according to them, hostile and degrading to women. Its hardly the climate you would want your daughter working or interning in, said one former Cato employee in an interview with Breitbart News. Most of the scholars at Cato are fine, decent, and sincere people. But Ed Cranes dismissive and degrading attitude toward women can make them feel more like meat than equals. [Emphasis added] I think its pretty open knowledge inside of Cato that most attractive female professional staff members have been the target of unsolicited sexual advances by Ed Crane, another former Cato employee told Breitbart News. Asked why such behavior was tolerated, the one-time Cato employee replied: In a place with no formal system of redress there becomes a complacent attitude of Oh, thats just Ed. Or Hes probably had too much to drink. [Emphasis added]

The billionaire Koch brothers and Cato, both of which support mass immigration and open borders as a pillar of libertarianism, have a long history together.

Though it is unknown whether or not the Koch brothers continue funding the Cato Institute, at least one of the Koch brothers, David Koch, was a board member at Cato up until 2013. In 1977, Crane, along with Charles Koch, founded the Cato Institute.

As Breitbart News chronicled in a series of reports in 2012, Crane allegedly planted multiple stories in the establishment media to vilify the Koch brothers as the conspirators behind the conservative movement, though the billionaires open borders views are at deep odds with the majority of conservatives.

A separate 2012 Breitbart News report detailed the alleged treatment to which Crane subjected Cato Institute board members and donors:

That kind of question is not appropriate for our dinner discussion this eveningsave it for the board meeting tomorrow! Ed Crane yelled at one of Catos newest board members, Nancy Pfotenhauer. How would you ever know anything about Catos policy priorities?! he barked. According to witnesses, with Crane commanding his post from the head of the table at this special March 31, 2011 board dinnerdesigned in part as a welcome for Catos newest board membersthe roughly two dozen Cato donors, board members, policy analysts, and senior managers in attendance sat in stunned silence. Bill Niskanen, a longtime leader at Cato, had just invited comments from these new board members.  Following up on a discussion about the future of Cato and its policy priorities, Crane had exploded as Ms. Pfotenhauer offered her question. Pfotenhauers question was innocent enough. Since Crane had been reporting on Catos recent capital fund raising drive and plans for expansion of its physical space, Pfotenhauer asked what the future vision and plans were for Catos policy personnel. Thats when Crane moved to end the discussion. I am so sorry if my question was inappropriate, said Pfotenhauer.  All I wanted to do was to acknowledge the prowess of your policy team. Crane, his face flushing red, then rose from his seat. Let me say something about these two new Koch operatives who have been placed on this board. And then, pointing his finger at Kevin Gentry, another new board member who had not yet spoken, Crane bellowed, Kevin Gentry, seated over there, has never once  never once!  invited me or any Cato scholar to speak at the donor conferences he organizes for Charles Koch. Then Crane stormed out of the room, leaving the dinner he himself was hosting."
2018-02-11,Breitbart,Donald Trump Fake News Running Same Negative Stories Over and Over Again,"So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesnt want to go there, he wrote on Twitter. Same negative stories over and over again!

Trump pointed to low approval ratings for the media.

No wonder the People no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history! he concluded.

Trump pointed to the number of Americans who had received bonuses from the latest Republican-passed tax cut.

4.2 million hard-working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut & Jobs Bill ... and it will only get better! he wrote. We are far ahead of schedule.

Trump also commented on a New York Times story that reported the Russians were selling phony secrets about him for $1 million.

2018-06-18,Breitbart,Obama Admin Approved 50000 DACA Amnesty Applicants with Criminal Records,"The DHS factsheet provides some criminal-history details about the 888,765 illegals who asked for work-permits from former President Barack Obama. Those details were hidden by Obamas deputies, who also hid information about the DACA illegals education credentials, eligibility, and work histories.

Many of the arrested DACA people are likely to be grandfathered into the pending amnesty developed by House Speaker Paul Ryan.

The list of 59,786 DACA recipients with arrest records includes 7,814 people who were arrested after getting their DACA status.

Also, 17,079 DACA recipients have been arrested more than two times, says the data.

Democrats have viewed DACA migrants through rose-colored glasses. In February, Rep. Nancy Pelosi declared on the Hosue floor that

We recognize that they are a blessing to America ... the dreamers are all over our country, Mr. Speaker, they are a blessing so across the board ... These are the best of the best. They are so fabulous ... I was impressed by the cumulative effect that they are making on their country. Each of them with their individual contribution to the greatness of America. So exciting, so proud of them ... [They have] great humility about conveying their stories because when you see them and they tell their stories and the passion and the pride  the patriotism, passion, pride, patriotism, that they demonstrate, you will see why anyone who has had the wonderful experience of being in conversation or observing our dreamers, understand why they have had such a high reputation among the American people. some of whom have met them, some of whom have heard about them, some of whom have just catch the spark, catch the spark. Recognize, recognize again the hard work ethic, the commitment to education, to community service, to faith, to family, to the United States of America. Its a beautiful thing ... Am I not lucky to be able to become so familiar with so many of these beautiful dreamers? We want to send these people back? This talent, this rich talent, this achievement, this determination, this faith in the future, this patriotism for America? I dont think so. We have to make [an amnesty] happen ... Let us acknowledge the dreamers and their optimism, their inspiration to make America more American...

DACA-approved people have been arrested for ten murders, 31 rapes, 95 kidnappings, 187 robberies, 425 hit-and-runs, 2,007 assaults, 4,611 drug offenses,  6,629 thefts, plus many crimes related to their illegal status  11,861 immigration crimes and 20,926 non-DUI driving-related offenses, such as a failure to signal a turn.

Obamas deputies were very forgiving of the crimes. For example, 2,503 people with arrest records for battery were allowed into the amnesty. So were 2,378 DUI drivers, 6,629 thieves, and 1,173 burglars.

Overall, 70.8 percent of applicants with one arrest were approved for the amnesty, as were 59.9 percent of people with two arrests and 51.7 percent of people with three arrests. One-third, or 33 percent, of applicants with eight arrests were included in the amnesty, as were 18.8 percent of people with a record of 10 or more arrests.

Also, 20,694 DACA applicants with arrest records were denied entry into the amnesty."
2018-06-19,Breitbart,Democrat Texas State Senator Resigns Following Convictions,"Spinning the best possible light on his resignations, Texas State Senator Carlos Uresti (D-San Antonio) wrote, As you know, I am in the process of ensuring that justice is served. I need to attend to my personal matters and properly care for my family. So, keeping in mind the best interests of my constituents and my family, I believe it to be most prudent that I step down from my elected office to focus on these important issues.

The important issues are 11 federal felony convictions handed down by a court in the Western District of Texas on February 22, Breitbart Texas reported. Immediately after the conviction, leaders on both sides of the aisle called for the embattled state senator to resign.

After being found guilty of such serious crimes, Senator Uresti must seriously consider whether he can serve his constituents, Texas Democratic Party Communications Director Tariq Thowfeek said, according to a report by the Texas Tribune.

Lt. Governor Dan Patrick (R), who presides over the Texas Senate, quickly removed Uresti from all committee assignments.

As lieutenant governor, I do not have the authority to remove Sen. Uresti from the Texas Senate but I have notified his office that he will be relieved of his committee assignments, effective immediately, Patrick said in a statement provided to Breitbart Texas. I will replace him in those positions shortly so that the work of these committees can continue to move forward.

After Uresti refused resign, pressure from Texas Democrats continued to mount.

In his resignation letter, the now former state senator asked Governor Greg Abbott to schedule a special election to coincide with the November 2018 General Election in order to save his districts voters the cost of a separate election dates, the Texas Tribune reported.

Texas State Representative Roland Gutierrez and former U.S. Representative Pete Gallego already announced their intention to file for the special election to replace Uresti.

Shortly after Uresti announced his resignation on Monday, Gutierrez sent out a fundraising email stating one of the saddest, most embarrassing stories of Texas politics finally comes to an end, the Texas Tribune stated.

Gallegos also wasted no time as he called for Governor Abbott to schedule the election as soon as possible. The former congressman said that as Senator Urestis legal process continues, my focus remains the people of Texas.

While Uresti faces up to 20 years in prison on each of the wire fraud convictions and 10 years for the money laundering convictionsthe Texas Tribune reported sentencing experts opinions that the senator might only face eight to 12 years in federal prison.

Senate District 19 covers 17 counties stretching from San Antonio through the Big Bend region and on to the New Mexico line."
2018-02-12,Breitbart,Trump Says US Will Impose a Reciprocal Tax on Imports,"Were going to charge countries outside of our countrycountries that take advantage of the United States, some of them are so-called allies but theyre not allies on trade, Trump said during a White House meeting on infrastructure. Were going to be doing very much a reciprocal tax and youll be hearing about that during the week and coming months.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross applauded the idea, saying that the U.S. needs to claw back the revenue other countries raise by taxing U.S. products.

The U.S. has very low tariffs compared with some of our biggest trading partners. The trade-weighted average of U.S. tariffs is just 2.4 percent. Chinas is 4.4 percent.

While Congress has the authority to set taxes and tariffs, the law authorizes the president to unilaterally impose tariffs in certain circumstances. In January, for example, the administration announced that it would impose tariffs on washing machines and solar products. The administration could potentially expand its use of these types of sanctions instead of waiting on Congress to pass new tariffs.

Last week, government data revealed that the U.S. trade deficit widened in December to its highest level since 2008, highlighting the urgent need for an American First trade policy."
2018-06-18,Breitbart,Andrew Cuomo New York Will Not Deploy National Guard to Border,"The administrations unconscionable treatment of families at our border is a moral outrage and an affront to the values that built this state and this nation, Cuomo said in a statement.

New York will not be party to this inhumane treatment of immigrant families, the Democrat lawmaker continued. We will not deploy National Guard to the border, and we will not be complicit in a political agenda that governs by fear and division.

The move follows Colorado Gov. John Hickenloopers decision to limit state resources used to separate immigrant minors from adults.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Securitys policy and practice of separating children from their parents when arriving at the southern border is offensive to our core values as Coloradans and as a country, the executive order reads. The administration announced a zero tolerance policy in the spring of 2018 resulting in family separations. The administration has recently stated that the purpose of the policy is to intimidate immigrants and deter crossings.

The Justice Department instituted in April a zero-tolerance immigration policy aimed at countering illegal border crossings, resulting in 1,995 children being separated from adults between April 19 and May 31."
2018-09-03,Breitbart,CNN Boosts Left-Wing Campaign to Censor Breitbart Approves Blacklisting,"## CNN swept aside journalistic ethics on Sunday by endorsing a blacklisting
campaign with a glowing interview of Matt Rivitz, the founder of Sleeping
Giants, a failed effort to censor Breitbart News by harassing and intimidating
companies whose advertisements may (or may not) have appeared on the website.

The interview took place on  _Reliable_ _Sources_ , a Sunday morning show that
once focused on analyzing the media, but which in recent years has been turned
into the editorial mouthpiece of CNN president Jeff Zucker, voiced through
host Brian Stelter.

Sundays program was helmed by substitute anchor John Avlon, in for Stelter 
who had earlier used his vacation to
[dodge](https://twitchy.com/gregp-3534/2018/08/28/stop-attacking-brian-
stelter-everyone-he-is-on-a-vacation-that-includes-interviewing-dan-rather-
and-blocking-folks-who-point-that-out/) questions about CNNs [failure to
retract](https://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/08/30/cnns-media-team-
addresses-michael-cohen-story-omits-key-details/) a false story about
President Donald Trumps former lawyer, Michael Cohen.

Ironically, Avlon and  _Reliable Sources_ addressed the Cohen story without
acknowledging that CNN had [lied](https://www.breitbart.com/big-
journalism/2018/08/30/cnns-media-team-addresses-michael-cohen-story-omits-key-
details/) about the fact that Lanny Davis had been one of its sources. Avlons
panel slammed Davis for backtracking on his version of events, then quickly
shifted to talking about threats made against the  _Boston Globe_.

Nor did CNN mention the fact that last week, a Mexican cartel boss was
arrested two days after [putting](https://www.breitbart.com/texas/2018/08/29
/mexican-cartel-boss-offers-100k-for-assassination-of-breitbart-texas-writer-
arrested-within-days/) a $100,000 hit on a Breitbart News reporter  a story
that, had it happened to a CNN reporter, would no doubt have been the lead,
not just on CNN, but on every mainstream media outlet in the country.

In the midst of a nationwide debate about whether, and how, social media
companies are [censoring and eliminating
conservatives](https://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/08/10/nolte-cnn-
openly-campaigns-blacklist-infowars/), a practice they euphemistically call
de-platforming, CNN weighed in clearly on the side of that censorship,
offering Rivitz an interview unchallenged by any opposing points of view.

In a revealing breach of journalistic ethics, CNN did not invite a
representative of Breitbart to counter Rivitzs claims, nor did CNN approach
Breitbart for comment until after the show  as they planned a follow-up
article based on their own flawed reporting.

Avlon proceeded from the false premise that Sleeping Giants censorship effort
was working, claiming in his introduction to Rivitz that Breitbart had seen a
steady decline of visitors and views since December of 2017. In fact, our
traffic has risen steadily for the last several months, including a 20%
increase in unique readers from July to August. Breitbart News is currently
ranked #62 among all websites in the United States, [according to
Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/breitbart.com). But CNN viewers could
not know that, because no one from Breitbart was invited to challenge the
false information that was presented.

In the interview, Avlon tossed one softball question after another to Rivitz.
At one point, he appeared to endorse Rivitzs goal, asking: What do you
envision as a more sustainable solution  is it white-listing quality news
sites? Is it blacklisting outliers that mainstream advertisers might not
want to support? What do you think is a more sustainable solution for this
problem that youre trying to fix?

Avlon only asked one critical question, about whether Sleeping Giants tactics
amounted to a slippery slope of soft power that ends up being a form of
censorship where activist communities on the right and left simply harass
sites they dont like. Avlon did not provide any similar examples of
conservative activists harassing left-wing websites, nor did he question
Rivitzs defense, which is that he and his cohort of left-wing activists have
tried to keep things really polite in harassing and intimidating businesses
with whom they have no actual relationship.

During the interview, CNN helped Rivitz make his case by presenting a graphic
with five supposedly bigoted Breitbart headlines. Four of the five were
opinion pieces; three of those four were written by a self-declared
provacateur to provoke discussion.

The fifth was a 100% factually correct piece of investigative journalism
written by this author: The Vetting  Exclusive  Obamas Literary Agent in
1991 Booklet: Born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii. The
[article](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2012/05/17/the-vetting-
barack-obama-literary-agent-1991-born-in-kenya-raised-indonesia-hawaii/)
documented the fact that Barack Obamas literary agent had promoted him in
1991 using a false biography that may have been the origin of the false
Birther conspiracy theory. The article even included a disclaimer from
Breitbart News management rejecting Birtherism (original emphasis):  _Andrew
Breitbart was never a Birther, and Breitbart News is a site that has never
advocated the narrative of Birtherism. In fact, Andrew believed, as we do,
that President Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961._


When the story  which took months of research  was published in 2012,

the mistake, attributing it to fact checking error.  It was covered widely
in the mainstream media, adding a new layer to Obamas many
[composite](https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/05/obama-new-york-

story that had anything to do with race: it was purely news.

2018-02-12,Breitbart,Budget Director Mulvaney No Balanced Budget for at Least a Decade,"Asked about whether the budget balances ever again, Mulvaney said there was a philosophical conversation about not projecting past the decade timeline. He said projecting out much farther would undermine the credibility of the numbers. He put an emphasis on giving the American people and Congress real numbers.

Mulvaney said that there are increased deficits for the first five years of the ten-year projection, attributing that to a decrease in revenues following the tax cut bill that passed last December.

The budget director recalled for reporters that in 2017 he had declared that without major changes, the budget would not balance within a ten-year window. Of $54 billion in proposed savings his office sent up to the Hill last year, Congress took up only $5 billion, according to Mulvaney.

We knew last year that wed be facing this, he said.

Mulvaney admitted to the press that he probably could have made it balance, but you all would have rightly just absolutely excoriated us for using funny numbers because it would have taken funny numbers to do it. He added, speaking of the OMB budget numbers, that these are real numbers. He said that there were a lot fewer plugged numbers in this budget than in the budget he released last year, because we have better data.

I hope there is some value in being honest with people about what the fiscal situation is, said Mulvaney. He said while the budget does not balance in ten years, it does turn the tide ... especially when you measure GDP  our debt as a percentage of GDP, we peak about 80 percent here in 20, 21, 22 and we get it down the other way.

Were not condemned to trillion dollar deficits forever. There is a way out of this, he added, but we have to take the spending side extraordinarily seriously.

The budget represents three trillion dollars in savings over the course of the ten years, he said. Its the second largest proposed reduction in spending ever. Second only to last years budget.

A reporter pressed Mulvaney on whether it was hypocritical for him to present a budget that doesnt balance as someone who considers himself a deficit hawk. Mulvaney put the responsibility back on Congress as the body that determines appropriations. We sent up $54 billion of reductions last year, they took five and pounded the hell out of me while they were doing it, said Mulvaney, adding that he knows what the attitude is on the Hill. Thats why we wanted to send both of these budgets, he said, speaking of the adjusted fiscal year 2018 and new fiscal year 2019 proposed budgets. Wed love to see them spend less.

Mulvaney then referenced a weekend tweet from the President before stating that they had to accept a bunch of additional non-defense discretionary spending in order to get the defense spending we wanted. [The President] said we had to accept a bunch of waste and extra spending in order to get that. Thats not ideal."
2018-07-08,Breitbart,Miss America Organization Revolts Against Gretchen Carlson After Nixing Bikini Competition,"Four members of the pageants board  including two former Miss Americas and two state titleholders  decided to resign after brief stints on the job. However, exactly why the four women decided to leave the board has become a point of contention.

According to Page Six:

Kate Shindle (now president of the Actors Equity Association), Laura Kaeppler Fleiss (who married Bachelor whiz Mike Fleiss), Jennifer Vaden Barth and Valerie Crooker Clemens posted a message to a private Facebook group claiming that Miss Americas account of their departures was inaccurate. Barth and Clemens claimed, Neither of us resigned voluntarily and that pre-signed resignation letters theyd had as interim members were used. Fleiss wrote, I stepped away from a board that I felt had become incredibly toxic. Shindle added, Many of us . . . expressed concern that we were expected to be a rubber-stamp board . . . I felt that our good-faith attempts to practice oversight were characterized as destructive, hostile and/or unappreciative.

That version of events was hotly disputed by the remaining members of the board, who contend that Fleiss and Schindle departed because of their opposition to former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlsons appointment as chair of the of the organization. The board further stated that Fleiss and Schindle, maintained an adversarial tone that permeated every discussion and decision. The board also claimed that Barth and Clemens voluntarily and with full knowledge offered their resignations.

In June, the Miss America Organization announced an end to the swimsuit portion of its competition and the practice of judging contestants specifically on their outward appearance. However, sources to Page Six claim that members of the organization felt misled as to the exact reasons why the competition was dropped. Saying they felt misled that the choice had to do with the pageants TV broadcast.

As one source said of the swimsuit cancellation: That was an inflection point.

Though, the Miss America Organization disputes that characterization as well.

Despite assertions you may have heard, the swimsuit decision was made unanimously by the board, including the former trustees. Any attempt to portray that decision as one made on an uninformed or misinformed basis is false."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,Texas AG Ken Paxton Signals Lawsuit If Obamas DACA Amnesty Does Not End,"Paxtons original lawsuit against President Trumps administration mandated that a decision on DACA  which has shielded nearly 800,000 illegal aliens from deportation  be announced by September 5, 2017. The suit prompted Attorney General Jeff Sessions to announce in September 2017 that DACA would officially be winded down and ended by March 5, 2018.

Now, though, since a California court struck down the Trump administrations ending of DACA, the temporary amnesty program has been reinstated and therefore if the U.S. Supreme Court does not take up the issue before the March 5 deadline, the program would be extended past the deadline.

Should DACA go on past March 5, Paxton, the original author of the 2017 DACA lawsuit, could file another suit to demand the program be ended for constitutional purposes.

When asked by Breitbart News whether Paxton would reopen his DACA lawsuit if the temporary amnesty continues past March 5, a spokesperson for the Texas attorney general said, Unfortunately, we cannot comment on potential future litigation at this time.

A report by the Dallas Observer revealed an excerpt of a brief wherein Paxton signaled a potential lawsuit if the Supreme Court does not decide on DACA before the March 5 deadline.

Paxton wrote in the brief:

Texas has successfully argued at all levels of the federal judiciary that the federal executive branch lacks the power to unilaterally grant lawful presence to unlawfully present aliens. Left intact, DACA would set a dangerous precedent by giving the executive branch sweeping authority to circumvent Congress and change our nations immigration laws. Today, consistent with the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers, Congress has an opportunity to act. [Emphasis added]

This week, Trumps Chief of Staff, John Kelly, shot down rumors that the White House would executively extend the DACA program for illegal aliens, saying of Congress, What makes them act is pressure."
2018-06-17,Breitbart,CNNs Ana Navarro Shame on Any Christian Who Uses Scripture to Justify Separating Families,"Sunday on CNNs State of the Union, network commentator Ana Navarro said it was the utmost cynicism for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to quote scripture in defense of separating immigrant children from their families.

Navarro said, Nobody is saying we want an open country. What we are simply saying is we dont want 2-year-olds torn from the arms of their mothers and crying.

She continued, The consequence of that is were going to have 2,000 children who will have incredible damage, emotional damage. The consequence of that is human suffering.

She added, It is the utmost hypocrisy, it is the utmost cynicism to quote scripturethe same scripture that was quoted to justify slavery to justify that. Shame on any Christian that is doing that.

Last week, Sessions said, I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order."
2018-07-10,Breitbart,Red State Senate Dems Face Difficult Balancing Act over SCOTUS Nominee Brett Kavanaugh,"Several Senate Democrats, many whom are facing difficult 2018 midterm election challengers, did not say whether they would back the Supreme Court nominee. Many pivoted to health care and protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) struck a hard line for his Democratic caucus, arguing that no Senate Democrat should vote for Kavanaugh because he might rule to overturn Obamacare as well as Roe v. Wade. Schumer said in a statement on Monday:

Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), who recently won a special runoff election against Judge Roy Moore, said in a statement on Monday:

Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), who faces off against state auditor and rancher Matt Rosendale in the 2018 midterm elections, said on Monday:

Rosendale asked Sen. Tester in a statement on Monday whether he supports the people of Montana or the far left, saying:

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), who hopes to defeat Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the midterm election, said he will evaluate Judge Kavanaughs record, legal qualifications, judicial philosophy and particularly, his views on healthcare.

The West Virginia Democrat then emphasized in his statement that he is concerned about West Virginians with pre-existing conditions and how potential cases on Obamacare and health care may affect those Affordable Care Act (ACA) protections.

Morrisey said in a statement on Monday:

Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL), facing a competitive election against Florida Gov. Rick Scott in the 2018 midterms, said that he looks forward to discussing issues such as protecting womens rights, guaranteeing access to health care for those with pre-existing conditions and protecting the right to vote.

Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), who faces off against Rep. Lou Barletta for the U.S. Senate seat, came out early against any potential Supreme Court nominee on Monday.

Congressman Barletta said in a statement on Monday:

Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) faces a tough race against Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and signaled that she will conduct a review of Kavanaugh, just like she did with now-Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.

An exhaustive and fair process took place for Justice Gorsuch, who I supported, and it should and must take place again now, Heitkamp said. And thats the kind of leadership North Dakotans expect from their senators.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) said on Monday regarding President Trumps Supreme Court pick:

Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) said in a statement on Monday:

Indiana Senate Republican nominee Mike Braun, who will face off against Donnelly in the 2018 midterms, said, I am sure Senator Donnelly will eventually say that he will vote for him, because it is an election year.

Braun added, But I can immediately say without hesitation that I would support this nomination and I hope the Senate moves quickly to confirm the Presidents choice."
2018-07-01,Breitbart,French Ambassador Praises Hungarian Prime Minister Brands Muslims in France and Germany Anti-Semiti,"In the confidential note, which was addressed to the Elysee Palace and top European Union officials, Ambassador Eric Fournier defends the Hungarian leader, saying that the migrant policy of Prime Minister Orban is a model for Europe and that many politicians in the west suffer from Hungaryophobia, French broadcaster BFMTV reports.

Fournier described Hungarys migration policy as having anticipated the problems posed by illegal migratory movements, and slammed Anglo-Saxon and French media, saying: Any democratically elected regime that does not correspond to their worldview [is called] populist.

The ambassador also defended the Hungarian government against allegations of anti-Semitism, saying that the true modern anti-Semitism belongs to Muslims of France and Germany.

When approached for comment on the leaked note, French president Emmanuel Macron slammed Fournier, saying: In no way do I share the words that you just mentioned and that you have revealed.

Macron added that if Fournier has said such comments in public the situation would be very different, saying: If the proof is given to me that these words were spoken publicly, a decision would be clear and would be taken. This ambassador would be dismissed.

The comments come as European Union leaders are attempting to address migration issues following the election of the populist Italian coalition and the move by new interior minister Matteo Salvini to close all Italian ports to NGOs ferrying migrants to Europe.

Pressure has also started to mount in both Spain in Greece, which have both also seen dramatic rises in the number of migrants crossing into their countries from the Middle East and North Africa."
2018-06-16,Breitbart,Giuliani Id Like To Give Mueller Team an Answer on Trump Interview by July 4 - Shouldnt Get I,"On Fridays broadcast of CNNs Cuomo Prime Time, Trump legal team member Rudy Giuliani stated hed like to give Special Counsel Robert Muellers team an answer on whether President Trump will do an interview with the special counsel by July 4th and the special counsel shouldnt get into manipulating the election.

Giuliani said, Id like to give them an answer by July 4. Because then theres enough time to do everything, and given the Horowitz report, I think we understand now, we dont want to get into manipulating the election. We dont. They shouldnt, meaning the special counsel."
2018-02-13,Breitbart,Netanyahu Fights Back Against Police Recommendation for Indictment,"But the prime minister is fighting back, declaring that the accusations are the result of a political campaign to remove him from power.

I am sure that the truth will come to light and that in the next elections I will once again win your loyalty, with the help of God, he said in a speech.

The left-wing Israeli daily Haaretz explains: The two cases are the so-called Case 1000  in which Netanyahu is suspected of accepting lavish gifts from wealthy benefactors in return for advancing their interests  and Case 2000, which alleges that Netanyahu tried to strike a deal that would have provided him with positive coverage in Israels second largest newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, in exchange for hurting its free rival, Israel Hayom.

Israel Hayom is backed by conservative American billionaire Sheldon Adelson and is considered pro-Netanyahu.

Allegations of corruption have long hounded Israeli prime ministers, both right and left. The late Yitzchak Rabin was forced to resign in 1977 over a bank account he and his wife illegally maintained in the U.S. And former prime minister Ehud Olmert was released from prison last year after being convicted of corruption. Others, like the late prime minister Ariel Sharon, was accused of breaking Israels strict campaign finance laws, but was never indicted.

Netanyahu has claimed for months that he is innocent of any wrongdoing, and his supporters believe that he is the target of a deep state campaign by the left-leaning Israeli establishment, which can no longer win elections thanks to the collapse of public faith in talks with the Palestinians and the viability of the lefts land-for-peace formula.

2018-06-20,Breitbart,Donald Trump Congress Must Let Us Deport Children and Families Together,"What Im asking Congress to do is to give us a third option, which we have been requesting since last year, the legal authority to detain and promptly remove families together as a unit, Trump said, calling it the only solution to the border crisis.

The president commented on the issue during a speech at the NFIB 75th Anniversary celebration in Washington, DC.

He said that he wanted to stop the separation of families but did not want to simply release adults and children together into the United States.

As a result of Democrat-supported loopholes and our federal laws, most illegal immigrant families and minors from Central America who arrive unlawfully at the border cannot be detained together or removed together, only released, Trump said.

Trump said that the current immigration and asylum law policies were enticing smugglers to bring children illegally into the country.

Theyve learned the loopholes in this horrible, rotten system that the Democrats have to help us fix, he said.

He dismissed a proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz to hire more judges to reduce the backlog of asylum claims at the border.

Ultimately we have to have a real border, not judges, Trump said.

He said more immigration judges would simply allow more illegal immigrants to come into the country, instead of keeping them out and set them free into the United States while they were waiting for a judicial hearing.

I dont want people coming in, Trump said. We want them to come in through a legal process like everybody else waiting to come into our country."
2018-06-12,Breitbart,Report Michael Cohen Telling Associates He Could Be Arrested Any Day Now,"According to a source close to Cohen, Cohen has told friends that he expects to be arrested any day now. (Reached for comment, Cohen wrote in a text message, Your alleged source is wrong!) The specter of Cohen flipping has Trump advisers on edge, reports Vanity Fair.

Cohen, whose New York office was raided by the FBI in April, is under investigation for crimes ranging from campaign finance violations to bank fraud.

Following the raid, Stephen Ryan, an attorney for Cohen said in a statement that the raid was conducted based on a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller.

The decision by the U.S. Attorneys Office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary, said Raid. It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney-client communications between a lawyer and his clients.

These government tactics are also wrong because Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath, he added.

Shortly after the raid, President Trump called the law enforcement action disgraceful, while flanked by members of his Cabinet.

Its frankly, a real disgrace. Its an attack on our country in a true sense. Its an attack on what we all stand for, the president said.

Its a total witch hunt. Ive been saying it for a long time. Ive wanted to keep it down. Weve given, I believe, over a million pages worth of documents to the special counsel.

They continue to just go forward, and here we are talking about Syria... and I have this witch hunt constantly going on, for over 12 months now, and actually much more than that. You could say it was right after I won the nomination, it started. And its a disgrace. Its frankly, a real disgrace. Its an attack on our country in a true sense. Its an attack on what we all stand for, he added."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,US Disappointed by Polish Presidents Authorization of Holocaust Bill,"The United States is disappointed that the president of Poland has signed legislation that would impose criminal penalties for attributing Nazi crimes to the Polish state, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement.

His comments follow a warning by the State Department last week that such legislation could result in repercussions for Polands relationship with the U.S.

Enactment of this law adversely affects freedom of speech and academic inquiry, Tillerson said.

The Polish president said the law will be presented before Polands Constitutional Tribunal to decide whether or not it infringes on freedom of speech.

While Tillerson acknowledged that terms like Polish death camps were painful and misleading, he said basic freedoms must be still be protected.

We believe that open debate, scholarship and education are the best means of countering misleading speech, he said.

The bill prescribes penalties for those who blame Poles as a nation for crimes committed by Nazi Germany during World War II.

Duda chose to authorize the bill and not return it to parliament for further debate or amendments. However, he has yet to issue a final signature. As of yet, there has been no word on when he will finally ratify it but sources close to the matter say it will happen very soon. Duda also said he would also request Polands constitutional court to evaluate the bill, leaving the door open for amendments.

In response to Dudas announcement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said that Israel continues to work with the authorities in Poland and expresses to them Israels reservations about the Polish bill.

Israel noted the fact that the Polish president referred the law to the Constitutional Court for clarifications on the matter, and hopes that in the period before the verdict is given, it will be possible to agree on changes and amendments to the law, it said in a statement. Israel and Poland have a common responsibility to investigate and preserve the history of the Holocaust.

The controversial bill stipulates that any individual who accuses Poland of being responsible for crimes against peace and humanity will be subject to a fine or prison sentence.

Whoever accuses, publicly and against the facts, the Polish nation, or the Polish state, of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German Reich ... or other crimes against peace and humanity, or war crimes, or otherwise grossly diminishes the actual perpetrators thereof, shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of imprisonment of up to three years, a translation of the bill reads."
2018-07-07,Breitbart,WATCH Florida Road Rage Incident Becomes Four-Woman Street Brawl,"The video, captured by a driver sitting in a nearby vehicle, shows a woman hitting another woman in the front passenger seat of a vehicle with a baton used by security guards and law enforcement officers.

The woman with the baton, Willie Edwards, hits the second woman, Erica James, multiple times as James tries to kick her attacker away from her, the Daily Mail reported.

The driver of the vehicle, Rose Alvarez, gets out of the car five seconds later to keep the conflict between the two women from escalating any further, when a fourth woman tries to confront her.

The fourth woman, Marquavia Jenkins, appears to push Alvarez while she is trying to get to the two brawling women. Moments later, Jenkins and Alvarez start their own brawl.

Jenkins holds Alvarez by her hair and pushes her to the ground while Edwards and James are still fighting. An unidentified man attempts to break up the brawl before the video ends.

Once police officers arrived at the scene, both cars had driven away, and the fight had dissipated.

When police discovered two women, ages 22 and 26, at a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, they opened an investigation to see who their attackers were.

The investigation led authorities to arrest Edwards, 18, and Jenkins, 21, on charges of criminal mischief and aggravated battery in connection with the alleged incident.

The state of Florida is no stranger to road rage incidents. In March, a Florida woman was savagely beaten by two women armed with baseball bats in a South Florida parking lot due to road rage.

In April, a road rage dispute in Florida got ugly when a driver rammed a motorcyclist off the road."
2018-02-07,Breitbart,Latest FBI Texts Hillbillys OUR Task Obama Wants to Know Everything,"Page and Strzok, who were engaged in an extra-marital affair, exchanged the text on September 2, 2016. The text reads, potus wants to know everything were doing. This is written within the context of disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey wanting to prepare talking points to give to Obama.

According to Fox, Senate investigators say this text raises questions about Obamas personal involvement in the Clinton email investigation.

The whole idea of an FBI director preparing talking points for the president on such a sensitive issue is bound to raise questions. So too Obamas apparent involvement in an ongoing investigation directly involving one of his former cabinet members, and possible successor.

Moreover, this news directly contradicts what Obama told the public.  I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations. ... I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation, Obama said then, reports the Daily Mails David Martosko.

Strzok and Page are the high-ranking FBI agents who despised Trump and exchanged thousands of text messages, some of which have already been made public. Incredibly, both were part of Robert Muellers special counsel investigation against Trump until it was revealed that they has exchanged texts that not only trashed the president but talked of an insurance policy should he win the election.

Other revelations in this latest batch of texts include Strzok smearing Virginians as ignorant hillbillys after disgraced former-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabes wife (a left-wing Democrat who received hundreds of thousands of dollars from organizations run by Clintonista Terry McAuliffe) lost a primary bid for state senate.

While his wife received this money from McAuliffe, McCabe was overseeing the investigation into Hillary Clintons secret email server.

Disappointing, but look at the district map. Loudon is being gentrified, but its still largely ignorant hillbilliy, Strzoks November 4, 2015, text reads the day after he loss.

The irony of Strzok misspelling hillbillies is worth noting.

Fox News also obtained texts written by Strzok in the immediate aftermath of Trumps presidential victory. OMG THIS IS F***ING TERRIFYING, he wrote to his paramour. Omg, I am so depressed. A week or so later Page wrote, I bought all the presidents men. Figure I need to brush up on watergate.

The next day, November 14, Page texted something ominous, God, being here makes me angry. Lots of high fallutin national security talk. Meanwhile we have OUR task ahead of us.

OUR task again raises questions about Strzoks August text about the anti-Trump insurance policy, which many believe is the phony Russian dossier that was paid for by the Clinton campaign but still used by Comeys FBI to obtain surveillance warrants on those affiliated with the Trump campaign.

2018-07-09,Breitbart,Cynthia Nixon No Better Description than to Call ICE a Terrorist Organization,"I can think of no better description than to call ICE a terrorist organization, and I will wear any criticism from mike_pence as a badge of honor, Nixon tweeted Friday, in response to Vice President Mike Pence, who told agency leaders that he and President Donald Trump are behind them 100 percent.

Every day men and women of ICE also confront criminal illegal immigrants who endanger our communities and prey on our most vulnerable, said Pence Friday, praising the more than 20,000 Department of Homeland Security employees he said stand for the rule of law in this nation and stand for the interests of the America people every day.

Nixon, who is trailing New York Governor Andrew Cuomo by ore than 20 points, made a similar statement about ICE last month during a speech at St. Paul and St. Andrew United Methodist Church in New York.

I think we need to abolish ICE, she said later that day on The View. That seems really clear. They have strayed so far from the interests of the American people and the interests of humanity.

To be sure, a majority of Democrats dont even agree with Nixon, and national Democrats idea that America should abolish ICE."
2018-03-24,New York Post,New witnesses detail alleged sexual misconduct by Tavis Smiley,"PBS says more witnesses have detailed sexual misconduct allegations against talk-show host Tavis Smiley, who was suspended in December and later fired.

In papers filed in Washington, D.C., Superior Court in response to a breach-of-contract lawsuit by Smiley, PBS said the witnesses spoke to an independent investigator and corroborated initial accounts that Smiley had established a pattern of sexual relationships with subordinates.

The filing Tuesday also said he subjected subordinates to unwanted sexual advances  including requests for specific sex acts  and made lewd jokes.

Over a dozen individuals reported that they were either subjected to or witnessed unwelcome, inappropriate sexual comments or conduct or otherwise inappropriate behavior by Mr. Smiley or were informed of the misconduct contemporaneously, the court filing said.

Smiley and his representatives stuck by their denials.

More lies, half- truths and smears from PBS from an investigation that never should have happened, with a result that was decided well before the inquiry was even begun, they said Friday in an emailed statement to The Associated Press.

The network said it also found further evidence that Smiley created an abusive and threatening workplace, often belittling and cursing subordinates.

Many of the witnesses were women of color, the documents say, pushing back against comments from Smiley, who is black, that racial bias was involved in his firing.

At the time of his suspension, Smiley acknowledged having had a sexual relationship with a colleague but said he had done nothing to deserve the public humiliation and personal destruction he was undergoing.

Smileys lawsuit, which seeks multiple millions in damages, also alleged that the PBS investigation was shoddy and poorly executed, and his dismissal was hasty.

PBS, in the answer and counterclaim, says those assertions in televised interviews after his suspension constituted a breach of contract by Smiley, who had agreed not to cast aspersions on his employer.

PBS acted at all times justifiably, in good faith, and with reasonable care and diligence, the filing said.

The network is seeking $1.9 in returned salary from Smiley.

Smileys dismissal came amid a wave of reports of sexual misconduct in the workplace by powerful figures in movies, media and politics that began with allegations against Harvey Weinstein in October and also led to the departure of Smileys fellow PBS talk-show host Charlie Rose.

PBS aired the show Tavis Smiley from 2004 until 2017.

Within weeks after his departure, he announced the beginning of The Upside with Tavis Smiley, a new show featuring inspirational stories that is streamed online and shown on The Word Network, a religious-oriented cable and satellite channel directed at black viewers."
2018-02-10,New York Post,Veteran FDNY paramedic busted for child porn still on city payroll,"A veteran FDNY paramedic was busted a year ago on felony charges of distributing child pornography, but has stayed on the city payroll while negotiating a plea in hopes of saving his job, The Post has learned.

Aaron C. Aguirre was indicted last March 14 after admitting that he communicated by e-mail with an undercover agent posing as the father of a 5-year-old girl, records show.

A complaint alleges that Aguirre, 34, expressed his sexual interest in the agents daughter, as well as other young children, Brooklyn federal judge William Kuntz II said in court last week.

The complaint also alleged that Aguirre ultimately sent the agent files containing images of toddlers private parts and pornographic videos of children between the ages of 4 or 5 and 7 or 8, the judge said.

Aguirres lawyer, Oliver Storch, told the court his client was negotiating a new plea agreement with the US Attorneys Office. Distributing child-porn normally carries penalties of five to 20 years in prison.

Mr. Aguirre is not a public officer as firefighters and police officers are, so upon conviction of a felony, he would not automatically lose his employment with the city of New York, Storch said.

Storch told The Post, Hes in the business of saving lives, and hes obviously devastated and saddened by these charges. The lawyer declined to comment further.

A fellow paramedic called it absurd to put someone accused of having sexual interest in children on a job that involves touching patients.

FDNY spokesman Frank Gribbon said, We would seek termination of any employee convicted of a felony.

Aguirre, who joined the FDNY in 2008, has served as a Haz-Tac and rescue paramedic instructor. He took home $95,953 last fiscal year, including $32,645 in overtime, according to SeeThroughNY.

After his arrest, Aguirre was suspended a maximum 30 days, then placed on restricted duty, meaning no patient care, no contact with the public, no access to computers and no OT, Gribbon said, adding that Aguirre is under direct supervision.

The FDNY did not inform the state Health Department, which licenses paramedics, about Aguirres arrest until after The Post inquired last week, officials said.

The agency is required by law to report all arrests and suspected crimes to the Department of Health. Failure to comply with regulations will result in an investigation and possible enforcement actions, said state Health Department spokeswoman Jill Montag.

The state will pursue an immediate suspension of Aguirres certification, Montag said.

Any incident that violates public health law, especially a crime involving children, will be immediately investigated and the department will aggressively pursue the strongest penalty possible under the law."

2018-07-13,New York Post,Navy SEAL who died rescuing soccer kids to get heros remembrance,"A renowned Thai artist will use his own dough to create a large statue of the former navy SEAL who died trying to help rescue a boys soccer team trapped in a flooded cave, according to a new report.

Chalermchai Kositpipat  known for rebuilding Wat Rong Khun, or the White Temple in Chiang Rai Province  told the Bangkok Post he would build a twice life-size statue of Petty officer 1st Class Saman Kunan to be placed in the Tham Luang Khun Nam Nang Non Forest Park, where the now famous Tham Luang cave is located, according to the report.

Kospitat decided to fund the creation of the statue on his own  because he wanted to show Kunans good deeds to other people, and turn the crisis into an opportunity, he told the outlet.

Dont worry about the budget, Kospitat told the paper. Im not a person who likes to show off good deeds. Over 300 fellow artists in Chiang Rai will join me in creating this work. We want to turn the Tham Luang cave into a new tourist venue worth a visit and study.

He told the outlet he also planned to organize an as-yet undetermined activity in honor of Kunan, who ran out of air as he was placing tanks throughout the cave to be used during the rescue mission.

In addition, the artist said he planned to create a large painting  about 10 by 42 feet  depicting the 12 team members and their coach venturing in the cave, becoming trapped and then being rescued, according to the report.

Kospitat has already began the sketch, and said on Friday it would be done in a day or two. Many fellow artists would then join him to paint it, he said.

The piece, which would be painted in sepia tones, would be kept at the Tham Luang cave, where a large exhibit hall will be built, according to the report.

The exhibit hall, which would display other paintings and drawings as well, would be turned into a museum and new tourist attraction, the artist explained.

Kunan ran out of his own oxygen as he was placing tanks throughout the cave in a desperate attempt by Thai authorities to eventually ferry the boys out with scuba gear, officials said at the time.

The last four boys in the 12-member team and their coach were rescued on Tuesday from the cave where theyd been trapped by the floodwaters for 18 days since going missing on June 23."
2018-05-03,New York Post,Throwing in front of screen may have messed up Jason Vargas,"Manager Mickey Callaway has one reason for Jason Vargas very forgettable Mets season debut. The Padres lit up the lefty for nine earned runs in 3 2/3 innings Saturday in San Diego. It was his first regular-season game after Vargas missed much of spring training with a non-displaced fracture of the hamate bone in his right (non-throwing) hand.

Throwing in front of this screen for a month, he changed his mechanics a little bit, Callaway said of Vargas, who will start again Thursday as the Mets try to salvage the finale of a three-game series against the Braves. He was really diving in with his shoulder and it looked like he was trying to throw around something. So they really worked in between on getting him where he needs to be, sitting back a little bit more. Were definitely not worried about his mentality or anything going out there tomorrow.

So the Mets are scheduled to start Vargas on Thursday, when they try to salvage the finale of the three-game series with the Braves at Citi Field.

Its kind of hard to judge what really goes wrong in a game like that where you give up that many runs in that short of a time, Vargas said, explaining there were points in that cameo appearance where he could have limited the damage but didnt. That gave them the momentum they needed other than the home runs to get in a position where they felt good at the plate.

Fortunately, I can say that hasnt happened too many times in my career, said Vargas who surrendered two homers in that first start and claimed no issues at all with the hand.

Yoenis Cespedes doubled in the first inning of Wednesdays 7-0 loss, and though it extended his hit streak to eight games, it was costly. As Cespedes stood at second, he removed his diamond necklace. The chain broke and diamonds spilled all over the basepaths. Asdrubal Cabrera picked up a bunch while playing second the next inning.

I got a couple, Cabrera said laughing. I dont know if theyre diamonds or not but I picked them up.

Jay Bruce was again taking practice at first base before the game.

That was my fifth time to do it, said Bruce who has played 15 major league games at first base, including 11 with the Mets last season. I played there my whole life until I was 16 and then I moved to the outfield. ... Im as comfortable as Ill be. Only way to get more comfortable is by doing it.

Bruce said the speed of the game has been the toughest adjustment in the infield.

Learning how to slow it down and not trying to speed up to try to make things happen. Just play the game, said Bruce who stays on alert for the infield call. They said it could be soon, thats all.

The call did not come Wednesday, when Wilmer Flores got the starting assignment. What was the toughest part of learning first for Flores?

Knowing when to get the ball between first and second, he said. That was the hardest.

Wednesday represented the first time the Mets were shut out this season. ... It also marked the first time they were out of first since April 3. ... The Braves have won four straight and six of seven games. They also have won 12-of-17 games at Citi Field. ... Flores broke a personal 0-of-19 streak with a ninth-inning double. He also ended the teams 0-of-18 streak against three Braves pitchers."
2018-02-23,New York Post,Case of NFLers abandoned car filled with weed bullets unsolved,"A case involving a car owned by Buccaneers wide receiver DeSean Jackson, hollow-point bullets and marijuana is inactive, and Tampa police do not believe the NFL star is at fault, ESPN reported.

A blue 2016 Chevy Silverado crashed into a tree and was found abandoned on Christmas Eve, according to a Tampa police report. The truck belongs to Jackson, and police found two hollow-point .38-caliber bullets and 6.3 grams of marijuana inside.

Jackson told police he was out of town at the time of the incident. He originally tried to report the vehicle as stolen, but later said a friend, Therrian Fontenot, had borrowed the car without his permission. Fontenot spent time with four NFL teams from 2005-08, including the Eagles when Jackson was there in 2007 and 2008.

Tampa police did not receive security footage from a shopping mall near where the accident took place, and Jackson has not helped them with pursuing Fontenot as a suspect, so the case is now inactive. Fontenot had a warrant for his arrest related to traffic offenses, according to ESPN.

Jackson had 50 catches for 668 yards last season, which was his first with the Buccaneers after three years in Washington and six in Philadelphia."
2018-11-25,New York Post,49ers Reuben Foster arrested on domestic violence charge,"San Francisco 49ers linebacker Reuben Foster was arrested at the team hotel in Tampa, Florida, on charges of domestic violence.

An arrest report from the Hillsborough County Sheriffs office says Foster was booked into jail late Saturday night. He is being held without bail.

Foster was arrested by Tampa police at 9:10 p.m. at the Grand Hyatt hotel where the team is staying before playing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.

The 49ers didnt immediately respond to request for comment.

This is not Fosters first run-in with the law since joining the 49ers last year. He was arrested twice last offseason, including on charges of felony domestic violence that were eventually dropped when a judge ruled there was no probable cause after the accuser recanted and there was no other evidence.

Foster was suspended for the first two games of the season because of the arrests."

The camera then panned left, revealing Crenshaw, who quipped, You think?

Crenshaw proceeded to taunt Davidson good-naturedly, at one point letting his cell phone ring and ring. The ring tone was a song by Ariana Grande, Davidsons ex.

Then Crensaw urged all Americans, as Veterans Day nears, to never forget. Well never forget those who died on 9/11, Crenshaw then added, as the two shook hands. Like Petes father.

The Salem News reports that 43-year-old Benjamin Espino, of Lawrence, pleaded guilty Monday to three counts of assault and battery and a civil rights violation. As part of a plea deal, the civil rights violation will be dismissed after five years if Espino complies with the terms of probation.

The attack happened outside a Lawrence club in 2016. Authorities say the victim was a friend of Espinos wife. Prosecutors say Espino called the woman a slur and attacked her after she danced with his wife.

Espino was also ordered to attend an anger management course and wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet as part of probation."
2018-07-18,New York Post,Woman denied LSBNSNLV license plate honoring wife,"GREENVILLE, N.C.  A woman says her request for a specialty license plate to honor her wife has been denied by the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles.

Amy Bright told WFMY-TV in Greensboro she applied for a plate reading LSBNSNLV, for lesbians in love.

The DMV issued a statement saying the agency has the right to deny any license plate it deems offensive to good taste and decency.

I think thats ridiculous. Im trying to celebrate the love I have for my wife, so I dont see how thats in poor taste, the Greenville woman said. How can a celebration of love be in poor taste?

The agencys statement to the television station doesnt address Brights request specifically; It says that personalized plates cannot include a message that is offensive to good taste and decency.

The statement also says the U.S. Supreme Court has determined that license plates are government speech, giving the state agency broad discretion in refusing to issue a plate with an indecent word or message. The DMV says it has rejected more than 7,000 license plate requests over the years.

Bright notes that her request has no curse words or hate speech. She said she previously had a plate reading OUTLSBN, for out lesbian. She thinks the rejection reflects someones personal feeling, rather than a governing principle.

Bright said her First Amendment rights are being violated. Shes appealing, and says shell sue if the appeal is denied."
2018-04-30,New York Post,Tesla driver banned from road after dangerous highway stunt,"A British man who turned on his Teslas autopilot and moved into the cars passenger seat  while the car was cruising down a highway  has been temporarily banned from driving.

Bhavesh Patel, 39, of Nottingham, was driving his white Tesla S on Englands M1 highway in May 2017 when he left the car unmanned, Hertfordshire Police said in a news release.

While the car was moving, Patel turned the Teslas autopilot feature and abandoned the vehicles steering wheel and foot pedals to slide over to the passengers seat.

A witness in a car driving past Patel captured video showing him in the passenger seat. Police said Patel appeared to have his hands behind his head.

A Tesla engineer told police that the cars autopilot features are intended to be used by a fully-attentive driver, and that drivers should never depend on [Traffic-Aware Cruise Control] to adequately slow down model S.

Tesla warns drivers, Always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.

Investigators said Patel was grossly irresponsible and his actions could have easily ended in tragedy. He not only endangered his own life but the lives of other innocent people using the motorway on that day.

Patel admitted in court that what he did was silly but said he happened to be the unlucky one who got caught.

He pleaded guilty on April 20 to dangerous driving. Among his punishments: he was banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to perform 100 hours of volunteer work  in addition to paying more than $2,100 in fees to the Crown Prosecution service."

2018-11-09,New York Post,Doc saves NY Marathon runners life but dont call him a hero,"Kristina Elfering, a 41-year-old civil engineer from North Oaks, Minn., felt ecstatic about running her first New York City Marathon to celebrate the 45th birthday of her friend and running mate, Victoria Nill.

But instead of crossing the finish line last weekend in Central Park after a successful 26.2 miles, Elfering collapsed at Mile 16, and nearly died.

The first couple miles, I was feeling good, Elfering tells The Post. As we crossed the Queensboro Bridge, I looked at my watch and thought: Wow, that was a really slow last mile.

I remember coming off the bridge, [and going] around the corner  and then I dont remember anything else.

She collapsed, unconscious. The culprit: a clot in her left anterior descending artery  which made her heart stop beating, and her lungs stop breathing.

Little did she know, help was just behind her  giving her a second chance at life. And Friday, she met one of her saviors for the first time since the incident.

Staten Island-based physician, Dr. Theodore Strange, 59  a doctor of internal and geriatric care who was running his 25th NYC Marathon with a 412-hour goal  had just crossed the bridge after meeting with a friend, who gave him orange slices to eat.

Any 10, 15 or 20 seconds couldve changed the outcome of this, says Strange, vice chairman of primary care at Northwell Health and vice president of medical operations at Staten Island University Hospital in Princes Bay.

He ran along the right side of East 59th Street and immediately knew something was awry.

In the whir of the crowd  thats one of the loudest areas [for supporters to cheer]  I just heard the word Help! 

Nill was standing over the unconscious Elfering. Initially, Strange assumed shed passed out from dehydration.

I realized very quickly something more was the matter, he says. She was turning blue and she was foaming at the mouth.

And there was no pulse.

Strange quickly began CPR, and called out for a defibrillator, which the NYPD and EMS personnel quickly delivered. Three shocks elicited no response from Elferings heart.

By the fourth defibrillation she came back, says Strange. She gasped and started breathing.

The pros  Strange, NYPD officers, firefighters and EMS workers  then loaded a still-unconscious Elfering into an ambulance to New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center  where her heart would be shocked once more.

All the while, Stranges family  wife Valerie, 59; sons John, 29, and Marc, 27; and daughters Victoria, 25, and Elizabeth, 21  were positioned on First Avenue, anxious to see him.

When we saw there was a pause in the tracking system, we started to get a little nervous, Valerie tells The Post. I said: Gee, why is he taking so long? Is there something wrong with my phone?  adding on that day, her husband hadnt gone out with his inhaler.

When he finally approached  after spending some 20 to 30 minutes at the scene with Elfering and the emergency officials  Valerie knew something was off.

He wasnt himself  he was dragging, she says. He walked over and just broke down, I just had to give someone CPR. 

And Strange himself, shaken from the experience, didnt know if he could finish the race.

Its OK! Its OK! Valerie recalls telling him. You did your job. Get on with it! Do it for [Elfering!]

Strange crossed the finish line with a time of 5 hours, 16 minutes.

I had no idea when I finished the race what was going on, says Strange, adding that through a family EMS contact, he found out Elfering was in the emergency room, alive and stable.

In the coming days, through a friend of a colleague whose girlfriend was Elferings nurse, Strange was told her family wanted to meet him.

On Friday, they finally did  with both referring to the meeting as emotional.

They wanted to know who their hero was, Strange says. But he doesnt consider himself a hero.

I was a tool in this, he says. I dont consider this heroic . . . I consider it my duty and my obligation. Let me give kudos to NYPD, FDNY and EMS because I didnt do this alone. It was a well-orchestrated team approach that got her through this.

Elfering later received a stent in that artery to keep it open for bloodflow. Shes now wearing a defibrillator vest for at least two months  and its too early to tell whether shell need a defibrillator surgically implanted.

Shes going to survive, says Strange.

Im hoping to run the [New York City] Marathon next year if they let me in, she says, adding she aims to run it alongside Strange. I have unfinished business."
2018-11-22,New York Post,Several dead after car drives into crowd of children,"BEIJING  A car plowed into a crowd of children outside a primary school in northeastern China on Thursday, killing five people and injuring 18, state media reported.

The driver was taken into custody after the crash around noon in the coastal city of Huludao in Liaoning province, state broadcaster CCTV said.

Eighteen people were hospitalized with injuries, the reports said. The cause was under investigation, according to the reports.

Security camera footage showed a line of children crossing the street in front of their school when a car approaches, then changes lanes and swerves into a crowd of the children.

Government spokesmen reached by phone said they were not authorized to release information about the crash.

While it wasnt clear if the crash was a deliberate attack, China has recently seen a number of such incidents.

Last month, a knife-wielding man drove a vehicle into a crowd of pedestrians in the eastern city of Ningbo, killing two people and wounding 16.

And in September, 11 people were killed and 44 hospitalized after a man drove an SUV deliberately into people at a plaza in the central province of Hunan, before jumping out and attacking victims with a dagger and shovel.

The most common motivations are identified as mental illness, alienation from society or a desire to settle scores.

Other deadly attacks have occurred at schools, including several in 2010 in which nearly 20 children were killed, prompting a response from top government officials and leading many schools to beef up security.

However, in June, a man used a kitchen knife to attack three boys and a mother near a school in Shanghai, killing two of the children. Last year, police said a man set off an explosion at the front gate of a kindergarten in eastern China, which struck as relatives gathered to pick up their children at the end of the day, killing eight people."
2018-07-18,New York Post,Leslie Jones slams Jessica Albas Honest Company,"Leslie Jones is one very unsatisfied customer of Jessica Albas Honest Company.

Ok @Honest you just lost a good customer, she wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon. @jessicaalba please address your company that is not doing good business. I have use your company for more than three years now and these last three orders have been a nightmare!! I have spend too much money here for that to happen!!

The 50-year-old Saturday Night Live star had ordered diaper cakes and paid extra for next day air.

Were so sorry your order was delayed, the company wrote back to Jones. Our diaper cakes are handmade and can take 1-3 days to process. We value your feedback and were always looking for ways to improve. We appreciate your love for Honest  thank you for giving us the chance to make this right.

Jones then angrily shot back, next day air should not be a fking option. it should be made clear that the order is sent after processing which you dont do. Its not overnight if it gets there in a week. you charging me damn near 50 dollars for. The last three orders were late. It wasnt like that before.

The Honest Co. diaper cakes page has a disclaimer that says they will ship within one to three days after the order has been placed. Its unclear if the site had the disclaimer before the exchange with Jones.

Alba also took to Twitter to send her apologies.

Omg! Im so so sorry you havent had a great experience, Alba wrote. We are all over this issue and will make it right. I am so appreciative and grateful to you for being a loyal Honest fan over the years, especially as we go through these growing pains. Im a huge fan of yours. JA.

Despite the apology, Jones stood by her comments, ending the back-and-forth by stating she would find diaper cakes somewhere else.

So disappointed cause Ive spent a lot of money with yall! she wrote.

Its not the first time Albas company came under fire.

In 2016, the company was sued by the Organic Consumers Association, claiming Honests organic infant formula includes no fewer than 11 synthetic ingredients."

Police in the Boston suburb of Malden say they staged the traffic stop Tuesday afternoon after spotting Grayson Salerno driving a red toy Mercedes convertible along a sidewalk.

Photos and video of the incident have been widely shared on social media.

2018-04-19,New York Post,It takes next to no time to crack an iPhones passcode,"Apple has steadily made the iPhone more secure over the past few years, but the device certainly isnt, nor has it ever been, impenetrable. As Apple has beefed up iOS security over time, hackers and security researchers, in turn, have upped their game as well. The end result is a seemingly a never-ending cat-and-mouse game wherein Apple tries to shore up security holes faster than researchers can exploit them.

As it stands now, it appears that Apple has a lot of catching up to do. Earlier this year, for example, Cellebrite revealed that it can now access any locked iPhone running any iteration of iOS going back to iOS 5. More recently, word of a new iPhone hacking machine dubbed GrayKey began making waves online. Per reports, GrayKey is a relatively simple tool that can hack into most iPhones. Not surprisingly, the tool  which has a base price of $15,000  has proven to be exceedingly popular among law enforcement agencies.

Now if youre dead-set on keeping the contents of your iPhone shielded from prying eyes, your best bet is to make use of a passcode thats longer than six digits. And for extra security, youd be well advised to come up with an alphanumeric passcode.

Heres why. According to cryptographer Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins (via Motherboard), heres how long it presumably takes GrayKey to crack iOS passcodes of varying lengths. As evidenced below, a 6-digit passcode can be cracked in about 11 hours on average.

While longer passcodes certainly provide an added layer of security, the reality is that most users will never opt for a 10-digit passcode. At a certain point, there needs to be a balance between convenience and security. That said, if youre not in a position to sacrifice security for any reason, then you might as well go ahead and come up with a long alpha-numeric passcode.

While the default iOS passcode now stands at 6 digits (it used to be 4 a few years ago), there is an option for users to choose a longer alpha-numeric code should they choose. To access this option, go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode. From there, you should see a Passcode Options tag that should let you pick a custom alphanumeric code for your iPhone."
2018-08-02,New York Post,Tesla stock surges as Musk looks to make good with analysts,"Tesla burned through less cash than expected and beat analysts revenue projections, but posted a second-quarter loss larger than Wall Street anticipated.

Yet the biggest surprise during Wednesdays earnings call was Elon Musks extending an olive branch to the same analysts the Tesla CEO slammed a quarter ago for asking boring, bonehead questions.

Theres no excuse for bad manners, he said in his apology, before adding there was a reason: I got no sleep and had been working 120-hour weeks.

Musk then put his signature optimism on display, saying it was Teslas goal to be profitable and cash-flow positive in every quarter going forward.

The overall performance pleased investors enough to send Tesla stock up more than 11 percent in after-market trading, where it topped out above $330 per share.

Driving the shares higher was a sharp reduction in operating cash-flow losses: from nearly $400 million in the first quarter down to just $130 million in the second.

The company ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash, compared with $3.5 billion in the prior quarter.

Despite its emphasis on cost controls, analysts remained mixed on whether Tesla would have to return to the securities markets to fund its build-out  a capital raise Musk insists the company can avoid.

At 7,000 cars a week, we believe we can be sustainably profitable, he said.

After achieving its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of June, Tesla said its gunning for a weekly production rate of 6,000 by late August.

Teslas revenue of $4 billion for the quarter beat Wall Streets forecast of $3.96 billion, while a loss of $3.06 per share came in greater than the $2.92 loss predicted by analysts."
2018-10-21,New York Post,NYPD yanks new-model body cameras after one explodes,"The NYPD is yanking all of the new-model body cameras worn by its officers after one of the devices exploded Saturday night because of a faulty battery, according to police.

An officer was working the midnight shift in the 121st Precinct on Staten Island when the cop noticed smoke exiting from the bottom portal of their body cam, the NYPD said in a statement Sunday.

The device  a Vievu model LE-5  exploded after the camera was immediately removed.

A body cam ignited while a cop was wearing it, a police source told The Post. Its an LE-5 model, so the department is pulling all LE-5 models off patrol immediately.

The officer was not injured.

The incident revealed a potential for the battery inside the camera to ignite, the NYPD said. The cause and scope of the defect are currently being investigated.

The NYPD has instructed officers to cease wearing all LE-5 models and warned against storing them in their department lockers, according to police sources.

Instead, the cameras should be placed on a docking station.

Its unclear exactly how many LE-5 cameras the NYPD uses. But that specific model is used by 15 precincts, two transit districts, one public-housing command and the police academy, department sources said.

In April 2017, the NYPD rolled out its body-cam program, with about 1,300 officers on evening shifts in 20 precincts across the city outfitted with the recording devices.

The entire force is expected to be equipped with them by the end of 2018."

2018-05-21,New York Post,Dean accused of sexual harassment re-hired at other schools,"STEVENS POINT, Wis.  A University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point official who handled sexual misconduct complaints and resigned when he was accused of sexually harassing a woman on campus in 2015, went on to hold positions handling similar complaints at two other universities, according to newly released documents.

UW-Stevens Point placed Shawn Wilson, assistant dean of students, on leave in September 2015 following the harassment complaint and he resigned the following month, according to university documents obtained by the Stevens Point Journal and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

The university investigated and found Wilson, the schools Title IX coordinator, had sexually harassed a woman at the Dreyfus Community Center during move-in weekend on campus in August 2015. Wilson denied the accusations.

Title IX is a federal civil rights law that prohibits sexual discrimination in education. Wilsons job included responding to complaints of sexual and behavioral misconduct.

In January 2016, Wilson took a new job as associate dean of students for Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where his duties also included serving as deputy Title IX coordinator. Knox College spokeswoman Megan Scott said the school conducts background and reference checks before hiring and generally would not hire an individual a person accused of sexual harassment to be associated with Title IX. Wilson worked at Knox until the following September.

The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire hired Wilson in August 2017 as interim dean of students, which again included responding to Title IX complaints. His tenure in Eau Claire lasted three months. Katie Jore, associate vice chancellor at UW-Stevens Point, said the school contacted UW-Eau Claire after learning that Wilson had been hired there. He resigned in November 2017.

Jore said that Knox College and UW-Eau Claire had called Wilsons former supervisor for reference checks. Both colleges told the Stevens Point Journal that the sexual harassment complaint did not come up in those checks.

Wilsons number is not listed in phone records."
2018-04-18,New York Post,What Zack Wheeler did without best stuff impressed Mets,"Even without his best stuff in his second start of the season, Zack Wheeler gave the Mets what they needed. He kept them in the game. He went six innings, not incredibly deep but not a cameo either, so the bullpen wasnt needed too soon.

And he delivered two hits and scored a run, which was a heck of a lot more than most position players.

After a solid season-coming-out party in Miami six days before, Wheeler did virtually everything the Mets wanted  except get them a win. Wheelers decent but not-good-enough performance could not deter a second straight Mets loss as the Nationals won, 5-2, at Citi Field on Tuesday.

I thought I did OK, Wheeler said. I thought I made a couple mistakes when I was ahead in the count, especially there in the fourth. I could have located the ball a little better. Overall, I thought I hung in there well pitched around a couple jams.

Wheeler mixed fastballs with breaking balls, found himself ahead in most counts and improved the breaking stuff as the game progressed. But also found himself working through a lot of traffic on the basepaths. For the most part he survived  Washington was 3-of-14 with runners in scoring position.

Ive always prided myself on that, Wheeler said of rising when trouble was the most evident. I really concentrate on shutting the guy down at second, try to make quality pitches, just holding the guy there.

Wheeler gave up seven hits and three earned runs in his 99-pitch effort. He walked three and struck out two. Wheeler, who went to Triple-A late in spring training before returning and working seven one-run, two-hit innings at Miami to win, slipped to 1-1.

I thought he threw the ball really well, manager Mickey Callaway said. I thought the only mistake he really made in the game was when he walked [Michael A.] Taylor. That probably ended up costing him two runs.

That came in the fateful fourth. After going up 1-0 on a Bryce Harper sac fly in the third, the Nats went to work in the fourth. Moises Sierra singled and stole second. Taylor walked before Wilmer Difos right-side single made it 2-0, a score that lasted until the next guy, Pedro Severino, singled to left driving in Taylor. Wheeler liked his pitch to Difo.

Nice changeup down and basically he hit it off the ground for a little blooper. It was just one of those nights, said Wheeler, who doubled and scored the Mets first run in the fifth  sliding home on Asdrubal Cabreras sac fly. That hurt. I havent slid in a while.

But what Wheeler did on the mound, not the bases, was what mattered of course.

He looked pretty good and he didnt even have his best stuff. His strikeout swing-and-miss stuff wasnt there, Callaway said. He battled through it and got through six and got a quality start."
2018-07-12,New York Post,Famed Coffee Shop in Union Square to close after 28 years,"The Coffee Shop in Union Square  a beloved staple made famous for its turns on HBOs Sex and the City  is closing on Oct. 11 after a 28-year run in which its fawning fans included A-listers like Julianne Moore, Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci.

Co-owner and President Charles Milite is breaking the sad news to the 150 employees of the 29 Union Square West eatery on Thursday.

The times have changed in our industry, he told The Post. The rents are very high and now the minimum wage is going up and we have a huge number of employees.

Known for hiring aspiring models  Milite himself was a model in the 1970s and 1980s  The Coffee Shop was a destination, in part, for its attractive employees.

We started with Live Bait, hiring all of our friends to work there and we kept that trend up, Milite said.

He owns The Coffee Shop with two partners.

The eaterys landmarked building is a throwback to the 1980s as is its old-style diner decor, which has not been updated in years.

Its Brazilian-American fare is popular with tourists and late-night revelers, but it has never been known for its top-notch service or culinary feats.

 Recent reviews on Yelp were mixed.

The Coffee House [sic] is an average and forgettable brunch place near Union Square. If youre desperate for diner food late at night, its not a terrible option, but its definitely not a spot you rave about the food quality or plan on coming to, according to one reviewer, while another wrote, ... the service we had dampened our experience. Our server was really unkind and cold, and never checked in on us (we had to ask passing staff constantly to fill our water and take our order).

Nevertheless, when the eatery was temporarily closed by the Health Department for sanitary violations in 2007, diners were shocked and couldnt wait to support the place when it reopened a few days later. A pregnant Naomi Watts was among the first customers to show up when it reopened.

A second Milite restaurant, Fats Fixed, situated next to The Coffee Shop, will remain open.

What looks like a bustling, busy restaurant has tremendous overhead, Milite said of The Coffee Shop. The business is good."
2018-03-21,New York Post,Tina Turner has forgiven Ike for years of abuse,"Tina Turner is living in a space of forgiveness.

The pop diva says shes forgiven former husband Ike Turner for years of physical abuse.

As an old person, I have forgiven him, but it would not work with him, Tina, 78, told The Times in an interview. He asked for one more tour with me, and I said, No, absolutely not. Ike wasnt someone you could forgive and allow him back in. Its all gone, all forgotten.

However, she admits to sometimes thinking of Ike, who died in 2007. I dont know what the dreams are about, she said. The dreams are still there  not the violence, the anger. I wonder if Im still holding something in.

The pair split in 1976 after she showed up at a Dallas Ramada Inn in a bloody white suit,  a scene made famous in Whats Love Got to Do with It? a biopic about Turners life. Their divorce was finalized in 1978.

In Takin Back My Name, his 2001 autobiography, Ike partially acknowledged his behavior saying, Sure, Ive slapped Tina. There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I never beat her.

Since then, Turner has enjoyed immense solo success with songs like Private Dancer and Better Be Good to Me, but her sound has changed.

I didnt like the blues because I didnt like what they were singing about, Turner explained. The blues can bring you down a little. I like to be a little bit up, and as soon as I left Ike, I never sung heavy, heavy rhythm and blues anymore. I Cant Stand the Rain was a blues song, and also the songs of Tony Joe White were blues, but an up-tempo, fine kind of blues. That was the change in my life, to enjoy singing."
2018-03-21,New York Post,Atmospheric river will drench California,"California residents, brace yourselves: an atmospheric river could bring multiple inches of rain to central and southern parts of the state over the next few days.

Read on for a look at the meteorological phenomenon  and what to expect from the storm.

An atmospheric river is a huge plume of subtropical moisture.

Atmospheric rivers are relatively long, narrow regions in the atmosphere  like rivers in the sky  that transport most of the water vapor outside of the tropics, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says.

When the atmospheric rivers make landfall, they often release this water vapor in the form of rain or snow, according to the agency.

They may also bring severe precipitation and destruction, though most are weak systems that often provide beneficial rain or snow that is crucial to the water supply.

The NOAA says atmospheric rivers are typically 250 to 375 miles in width.

The National Weather Service (NWS) Los Angeles tweeted Tuesday that the atmospheric river event was happening.

Heavier rain expected tonight into Thu with Flash Flood Watch in effect for recent burn areas, it said.

The agency said in another tweet that coasts and valleys could get two to six inches of rain, with foothills and mountains getting five to 10 inches.

As many as 30,000 people have been ordered to leave communities by noon on the south coast of Santa Barbara County, where a Jan. 9 deluge unleashed deadly debris flows into Montecito.

Neighboring Ventura County has taken similar measures amid concerns in adjacent counties.

Northern California is also expected to see rainy weather for a few days, according to the NWS."
2018-03-02,New York Post,Congressman no longer likes Tweet slamming school shooting survivor,"GLEN ALLEN, Va.  A Virginia congressman has purged his campaigns Twitter account of likes of controversial tweets, including one that suggested a survivor of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting was a paid actor.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch cites a statement from the campaign of Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Brat saying a campaign staffer mistakenly liked the tweets, thinking they were logged into their personal account. The statement asserted neither the congressman representing the Virginias 7th congressional district nor his staff supports any alt-right views.

The tweets in question included one from Feb. 26 attacking David Hogg, the 17-year-old Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student who has called for gun control.

Last July, the congressman attracted attention for a post endorsing sending former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Libya. He said he never approved the post."
2018-05-03,New York Post,Adidas stands by Kanye West despite slavery comments,"Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted distanced himself from Kanye Wests controversial slavery comments earlier this week, but said the company has not discussed parting ways with the rapper as a designer.

There clearly are some comments we dont support, Rorsted said in an interview with Bloomberg TV, adding that the company plans to talk with West about the matter. Kanye has been and is a very important part of our strategy and has been a fantastic creator, he said, declining to comment more specifically on Wests statements regarding slavery despite repeated questions from the interviewer. He added that West and his Yeezy footwear brand are a very important part of our brand from a revenue standpoint and how we promote our products, but emphasized the companys overall strength.

During a conversation on TMZ Live with Harvey Levin and Charles Latibeaudiere, West said, When you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years?! That sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and its all of yall. Its like were mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Slavery is to blacks as the Holocaust is to Jews. Prison is something that unites as one race, blacks and whites, that were the human race.

West also further explained his support of President Donald Trump on the show after tweeting a picture last week of him wearing a Make America Great Again hat.

I just love Trump, West said. Thats my boy. Like so many rappersyoull look at a video of Snoop Dogg loving Trump but then he get in the office and now they dont want to love him.

Trump is one of raps favorite people, he concluded."

2018-03-06,New York Post,Red Bulls get benefit of inside information in CONCACAF,"Forward Armando Moreno hasnt appeared for the Red Bulls yet, but hes doing his part away from the field.

Moreno provided the Red Bulls with a mini scouting report for Club Tijuana, where he spent the past three seasons, ahead of the clubs CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinals first leg Tuesday (10 p.m.; Univision) at Estadio Caliente in Tijuana, Mexico.

They have a new coach and some new players so its a little bit different than when he was there, but we used him to talk about everything from what the turf in the stadium is like to what their players are like and how they play, Red Bulls coach Jesse Marsch said. He was very helpful. We hope that gives us a little bit of an advantage.

The Red Bulls earned a berth in the quarterfinals after pushing past Honduran side Olimpia 3-1, on aggregate. It was the first time in club history the Red Bulls secured a knockout-round victory.

Although the Red Bulls seemed easily in control against Olimpia, Club Tijuana will prove a different test. Marsch predicts Club Tijuana will try to spread the field, something Olimpia did a few times in the Red Bulls 2-0 victory Thursday.

Marsch said Moreno, who rejoined the Red Bulls in the offseason, made the team look more carefully at Club Tijuanas players and even offered his teammates some advice.

Club Tijuana knocked out Honduran club Motagua 2-1, on aggregate. They currently sit sixth in the Liga MX standings, just four points behind first-place Santos Laguna.

Marsch also warned about Club Tijuanas ability to capitalize on the counterattack while being clinical around goal. Club Tijuana is coming off a 3-1 league win against Lobos BUAP on Friday.

We know they have four attackers who are really crafty and have created a lot of their goals going forward this season, midfielder Tyler Adams said. When we have the ball transitionally, they like to get numbers behind the ball. That sets up well for us in the sense that our pressing and going forward has to happen quickly."

2018-08-14,New York Post,Sterling K Brown undecided on Oscars popular film category,"At an FYC event for This Is Us at Paramount Studios, Brown, who played NJobu in the Marvel blockbuster, told Variety his stance on the category  particularly as it relates to Black Panther, which is eligible for 2018 nominations  goes back and forth.

When I first heard of the category, the first question I had was, What is the criterion for being nominated in this category?  Brown said. If its something that can give it some sort of merit and legitimacy, then I think its cool. But I think Black Panther stands on its own merits regardless of its popularity as being a wonderful piece of art.

Ryan Coogler is an artist, Brown continued. The man is three for three in his films thus far, and I dont see him striking out anytime soon. So whether its in one category, the other, or both, the movie is worthy of recognition.

His sentiments echo those of many whove weighed in on the new category, saying it may give the Academy an excuse to leave commercially successful films  which have historically not made serious headway with the Academy despite their potential artistic merits  out of the best picture category in favor of more typical Oscars fare  and that, practically, the addition doesnt make sense. Varietys awards editor Kristopher Tapley termed the move desperate.

Of Black Panther particularly, Tapley wrote: Disney has taken the task of bringing Ryan Cooglers critically acclaimed Marvel film into the Oscar fold quite seriously this year. A consultancy team was assembled early and that group has been laying the track ever since. Now here comes the Academy, establishing a corner to which voters can banish this and other films like it with a pat on the head and a thanks for playing.'"

Its crucial for me to be a positive role model for the kids who came to training camp to watch us. My behavior here and during the season is bigger than proving some sort of point during practices.

During the joint practice Tuesday, Pryor was on the receiving end of extensive jawing from the Washington secondary after a one-on-one drill against cornerback Montae Nicholson ended with the football on the ground.

When Pryor, who spent last season with the Redskins, went to end the trash talk coming from the Skins secondary and safety D.J. Swearinger, in particular, Swearinger wound up for an instant, and Pryor reacted in the worst way possible. He flinched.

That was all the Redskins needed to see, and they will be sure to let him know it Thursday."
2018-09-23,New York Post,Fed-up Steelers put LeVeon Bell on trade block,"In Khalil Mack, one of the best defensive players in the NFL was traded on the eve of the NFL season.

In the seasons early stages, one of the best offensive players in the league might meet the same fate.

LeVeon Bell, in Week 3 of his regular-season holdout after missing all of the Steelers offseason, is on the trade block, ESPN reported Sunday.

Pittsburgh is listening to offers for the 26-year-old superstar running back, a Pro Bowler in each of the past two seasons whos put up 35 rushing touchdowns in his five professional seasons.

Bell, who could be a free agent after the season, was supposed to make $14 million this season under the franchise tag. He has not been collecting that money, hoping to force Pittsburgh (off to an 0-1-1 start) to give him the mega-deal he covets.

Its been a weird start to the season for Pittsburgh. Last week, the Steelers heard what they wanted to hear from star wideout Antonio Brown, who had speculated vaguely about the team trading him: He wants to be a Steeler and is pissed off about the start of the season.

With one potential headache over, the Steelers may be trying to end their current one."
2018-05-25,New York Post,Donald Trump Jr is sniffing around for a book deal,"As this years best-seller list continues to be crammed with books on the Trump administration, Page Six has learned that Donald Trump Jr. wants to add his name to the list.

Publishing insiders tell Page Six that Trump Jr. is shopping a tome, and is being repped by top agent David Viglianos literary firm AGI Vigliano.

The agencys been behind recent books by Rose McGowan, Mike Tyson, Joy Behar, Newt Gingrich and Lil Wayne, as well as Chip and Joanna Gaines, Janet Jackson and Luann de Lesseps.

Its unclear what the book would cover. But Trump Jr. has certainly been in the headlines, for everything from his meeting with a Russian agent offering dirt on Hillary Clinton in 2016 to his dramatic split from Vanessa Trump in April, which was revealed by Page Six.

A stream of this years top best sellers have been about the Trump administration  Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff, Michael Isikoff and David Corns Russian Roulette, and former FBI head James Comeys recent A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership  though none of those have been supportive.

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper this week published Facts and Fears: Hard Truths From a Life in Intelligence.

Short-lived White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci inked a book deal in March, and his immediate replacement, Hope Hicks, has reportedly been swamped with requests for her to pen a book, with one offering a $10 million advance. Trump Jr.s mom, Ivana, published the memoir Raising Trump last year.

But one publishing source quipped of a potential Trump Jr. tome, Do his fathers lawyers know about the book? Just asking!

Signaling a further move into media, Page Six reported this month, Trump Jr. has moved on from estranged wife Vanessa to Fox News beauty Kimberly Guilfoyle.

Reps for Trump Jr. and AGI Vigliano did not respond to multiple requests for comment."
2018-05-26,New York Post,How I learned to love my online trolls,"I dont want to brag, but I have an especially strong following of Internet trolls. And this isnt just anecdotal: Someone at Twitter actually told me that I have some of the worst trolls on the platform. It could be that I was early to join the site, or that I joined during my time as an openly gay left-wing commentator on Fox News. That probably was a factor.

Now, not a day goes by when I dont get a barrage of nasty responses to even the most innocuous posts. Sure, if I post something about politics, the trolling is predictable: tweets like @sallykohn stupid u should have been aborted u fing commie!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and Next to the radical Islamic extremist who murdered 49 human lives on Saturday, you are truly one of the most hate-filled individuals I know of in this country.

But even when I post apolitical things, I get trolled.

During the 2016 elections, I posted a picture of my dog in the park, and pro-Trump trolls filled my Instagram feed with #MAGA (as in Make America Great Again). Trolling my dog? To be fair, one person did post, #MAGA but your dog is cute. Which she is. But thats not my point. Who trolls a picture of a dog in a park?

While researching my book The Opposite of Hate: A Field Guide to Repairing Our Humanity, I decided to find out. I reached out to some of my most vicious trolls and talked with them on the phone. I asked about the messages they sent me, but I also asked about their lives and their hobbies and their viewpoints and why they were on social media in the first place. I wanted to understand why they did what they did online but also who they were offline, in real life  and the relationship between the two. I learned three things that surprised me:

First, I learned that people feel less inhibited online  what scholar John Suler calls the online disinhibition effect. The people on the other end of technology are real, but practically speaking the exchanges on social media seem to only happen in our imaginations. We feel like were just talking to ourselves, like venting in a journal.

Studies show that if people can see a screen showing the eyes of the person theyre corresponding with online, they behave more respectfully and kindly. If I dont know you, Im not going to spout off at you in person. Thats just not me, one of my trolls, @LindaLikesBacon, says to me over the phone. But Twitter, she explains, is a different story. Its kind of like hiding behind an anonymous wall.

Do you think youre nicer in real life or on Twitter? I ask another of my trolls who calls himself @bmenyhert.

Even though the Internet in theory connects us more than ever before, we still experience it alone  and the experience of being online can be very lonely. This leads to my second realization: In addition to or even compounded by that sense of isolation online, my trolls felt invisible in the world at large. They didnt think their tweets mattered because they didnt think their voices mattered  or that they mattered, really. For instance, none of my trolls thinks anyone reads the nasty messages they post online. Certainly, they dont think Im reading them.

After I reached out to my troll @bmenyhert, he messaged me: My apologies to you/whoever handles your Twitter maam since I have tweeted some dk things in your direction.

Do you think about the impact of your tweets? I asked @ArlingtonSteve, another of my top trolls.

Well, honestly, I kind of figured no one reads or cares, he answered. There was a defeatism in that answer. My trolls felt invisible and voiceless.

Which relates to the third thing I learned, which is that were all suffering. I already knew this, of course. And I also know theres much greater suffering in the universe than being a TV pundit visible enough to get hate mail. Still, its one thing to know that at a theoretical level and something else to experience it directly. Here I was calling my trolls to confront them about the minor irritations theyd caused me and they were barely scraping by on Social Security or in jobs they felt were pointless.

@LindaLikesBacon told me about her 24-year-old son who, at the time we spoke, was in rehab for a meth addiction. I just went to see him, she told me. He seems to be doing really good. Hes only got a couple months in, but hes determined to finish, so hopefully this will do the trick.

Facing up to the online hate can be frightening, but it also can bring real change. Megan Phelps-Roper, the granddaughter of Westboro Baptist Church founder Fred Phelps, was once a professional troll, tasked with spreading the organizations message of hate. She targeted several prominent Jewish activists and leaders with smears and threats, but one of them, a blogger named David Abitbol, responded back not with hate but humor and, eventually, even kindness. And over time, because of the friendly and compassionate relationship they built online, Phelps-Roper left Westboro and renounced her life of explicit hate.

We all suffer and we all dream, were all vulnerable and were all afraid, we all just want to be seen and heard. Understanding that changed me. And changed my trolls, too, I think. After we spoke, @LindaLikesBacon wrote to me, Enjoyed talking with you today, and since our conversation, shes stopped trolling me. Meanwhile, months after we spoke, another of my trolls sent me a note wishing me a happy new year. And they all kept asking when my book was coming out.

We need to think twice before labeling our social-media neighbors as trolls. Trolls are creatures who live under bridges and throw rocks, not actual people with fears and pain. For me, this realization only came after I came out from behind my screen and connected in real time. Its harder to hate when we actually know each other.

2018-03-05,New York Post,Chris Berman left racially disparaging voicemail to Jemele Hill suit,"Within the bombshell, wide-reaching lawsuit that former anchor Adrienne Lawrence filed Sunday against ESPN is an allegation of misconduct against Worldwide Leader icon Chris Berman.

In early 2016, the longtime face of the network left a threatening and racially disparaging voicemail on Jemele Hills ESPN work phone, the suit alleged, while Hill was working on His & Hers.

Lawrence, whos suing ESPN for discrimination and fostering an atmosphere of sexual harassment, alleges that Hill informed the shows executive Marcia Keegan and forwarded the senior HR director the voicemail, and nothing was done.

Despite his continued and repeated misconduct toward women, Berman remains a celebrated and welcome ESPN employee, the suit states.

It is unclear how Lawrence was made aware of the alleged voicemail or what it specifically contained.

Berman has taken a backseat at ESPN since early 2017 and now appears on the network sporadically. ESPN reportedly settled a sexual harassment suit against Berman in 2015, when a former makeup artist received allegedly inappropriate messages from the voice of NFL Primetime.

Neither Berman, Hill nor ESPN has commented about the allegations.

Lawrence, a former anchor and legal analyst for ESPN, is accusing the network of turning a blind eye to widespread harassment."

2018-11-10,New York Post,Ex-Manhattan great wont let cancer tragedy keep him from game,"Three years had passed since Emmy Andujar was the leading-scorer on an NCAA Tournament team, since the Bronx native helped Manhattan cut down a net for a second straight season.

The years took him from the Edenwald housing projects to a professional career in Spain, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic; from Rice High School to a starring role in the championship series of Mexicos top basketball league.

This April, another title was in sight. Then, Andujar felt an unusually sharp pain in his lower abdomen.

I went to the hospital and I got blood tests done, and they saw things were a little bit off, Andujar said. Then they told me I had cancer.

It was Stage 2. Surgery was scheduled almost immediately.

I wasnt thinking, Andujar said. I just wanted to get right to it and get it done.

Andujar didnt tell his mother, Migdalia, hoping to keep her from concern. He left his former college coach no choice.

On a Wednesday night in New York, Steve Masiello received a stunning call from his first recruit. Surgery was that Saturday in Mexico.

Its one of those situations where youre like, Is this real? It was just a punch to the face, hearing this from a kid you love so much, Masiello recalled. I said, Calm down, let me get on the phone with some people, let me talk to the doctors, lets get a second opinion, just trying to talk him through it. ... We decided he should come back to the States as soon as possible.

Andujar returned to New York and underwent a pair of surgeries, spending much of his summer undergoing chemotherapy in Westchester County.

You look in the mirror and you dont see yourself, Andujar said. You lose your hair. Your face is getting fat, or real skinny. It was physically draining and mentally draining, just trying to be positive.

As time went on, I thought, Am I gonna die at a young age, or what things is my family gonna go through if things escalated? At the age of 26, I just couldnt see myself leaving this world.

Six years earlier, Andujar was in his apartment building, looking at the body of his older brother, Jose, who had been killed by a bullet to the back of his head.

For my mom, it was very scary because she lost a son already, but as long as she saw me being positive, that kept her positive, said Andujar, who testified for the prosecution in the murder trial. No matter how my body was changing, or how weak I would look, I always kept a smile. If she saw me smiling, she would smile.

Sometimes, he couldnt force a smile. Sometimes, he didnt feel well enough to leave the apartment.

When Andujar could make it to Draddy Gymnasium, there was joy. When he was back on the court, there was purpose.

Im in the gym one day in the summer and I hear a ball bouncing, and I look downstairs and I see Emmy in the gym shooting by himself, Masiello said. He just had chemo. It was like his third week. Im like, What are you doing? You cant be here. He said, This is all I know. I dont know what to do.

He was up here a lot, and I said, If youre gonna be around, lets get you a coaching job. Id love to have you. He didnt hesitate. He said hed love that.

While Andujar underwent treatment, he began working with the newest batch of young Jaspers. Now, he is a special assistant on the coaching staff  and he is cancer-free.

When I first heard about cancer, most people think of death, but for me it was like, I cant play basketball anymore, Andujar said. I just wanted to be around basketball. If I cant play, why not be around it in other ways? Its a great opportunity. This is always my home.

The position is temporary. Andujar is intent on resuming his professional career early next year.

For now, he awaits medical clearance to begin regular workouts. Doctor visits remain a part of his routine. The recovery cannot be rushed.

On a Wednesday night in New York, Masiello is on the phone. Andujar is watching film for Manhattans next game.

He should be playing until he cant play anymore, but a big part of coaching is leading, and hes always been a leader, Masiello said. Everything hes saying is from a players perspective, and its really good for me, because hes a phenomenal buffer because he understands both sides of it, and really understands what theyre thinking.

You can see how the guys gravitate to him. You see how the guys listen to his words, and his words are very powerful. What a role model for them to have. If there was a book for young people in how to handle adversity, Emmy would be the author.

2018-06-12,New York Post,NBC mulls moving Megyn Kelly Today to a new time slot,"NBC is starting to think about reshuffling its morning lineup to limit the damage done by struggling Megyn Kelly Today.

Sources tell Page Six that network execs are considering moving Megyn Kellys show  which has been having a hard time attracting viewers since it debuted in September  an hour later, and bringing Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotbs popular hour of the Today show forward by an hour to replace it.

As Page Six reported in October 2017, Gifford and Kotbs ratings took a huge hit after Kelly replaced Tamron Hall and Al Rokers Todays Take at 9 a.m.

At the time, Kelly was down 32 percent compared to the time slots viewership in the previous year. This dropped Gifford and Kotb by 26 percent, because the viewers who turned off Kellys show never returned for Gifford and Kotbs 10 a.m. hour.

Its the smart move, said an insider of moving Kelly. At the very least that limits the damage already done to Hoda and Kathie Lee  maybe with a strong lead-in from Today at 9 a.m., theyll even pick up some of the viewers they lost since Megyn went on the air.

The 7 to 9 a.m. slot  anchored by Kotb and Savannah Guthrie  has been doing brisk business since Kotb took over for Matt Lauer after he was fired in November because of allegations of sexual misconduct.

Were told that the time switch would be a bonus for Kotb, because she could do all her on-air work in one block  between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m.  rather than having the one-hour gap between her slot with Guthrie and her slot with Gifford.

Kelly signed with NBC in January 2017 for a reported $20 million per year.

Meanwhile, a network source pointed out that Kellys numbers are heading upward, and another quipped, Just another timeless rumor about Megyn Kelly."
2018-05-28,New York Post,On this Memorial Day consider what we owe Americas veterans,"The numbers are sobering: More than 1 million men and women have given their lives serving in our military during wartime, with thousands more dying in other conflicts.

Many died long ago in some of our nations  and worlds  most-well-known conflicts. Some died during operations few will ever hear about in history class. And, unfortunately and inevitably, more will die serving our country honorably battling terrorism, tyranny and threats to the American way of life.

None will be forgotten.

Officially recognized as first having been celebrated upstate in Waterloo in 1866, Memorial Day  then known as Decoration Day  was a community remembrance.

When the first official Decoration Day ceremonies were held at Arlington National Cemetery in 1868, James A. Garfield, a future president and a Civil War combat veteran, told the thousands gathered, For love of country they accepted death, and thus resolved all doubts, and made immortal their patriotism and their virtue.

Today, we still remember their patriotism and virtue, and that of the scores who have selflessly sacrificed since to make this the greatest country in the world.

 It is a blessing to count myself among those who served our nation and came home to enjoy all that America has to offer. While many have been so lucky to return, there are countless others who have struggled with the lasting effects of conflict, both physical and emotional.

In the same way we must not forget the sacrifice of those who have given their lives to protect our freedoms, we proud Americans and New Yorkers must not turn our backs on our veterans and military members in need.

We owe it to our veterans grappling with post-traumatic stress to continue researching new treatment options. According to the US Department of Veterans Affairs, between 11 and 20 percent of our Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom veterans deal with PTS. It is estimated that about 30 percent of our Vietnam veterans have had PTS at some point, according to the VA.

We owe it to our veterans who have fallen into homelessness or are on the verge of homelessness to ensure that they do not continue to slip through the cracks. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated in 2017 that more than 40,000 veterans were homeless on any given night, with more than 1,200 veterans experiencing homelessness in New York.

As a state and a nation, we must get our arms around this crisis and implement the proper policies to make sure vets have what they need long before they reach the point of homelessness or penury. We cant wait until people are in crisis before we help them.

We owe it to all veterans and their families to ensure they receive the benefits theyre entitled to. No veteran should have to worry that red tape will keep them from accessing health care, education, insurance and the many other benefits we offer those who served.

Just as I am a proud New Yorker, American and veteran, I am a proud member of the American Legion, an organization that for nearly 100 years has advocated for veterans and active-duty military members to ensure that all sacrifices are remembered. As we near our centennial celebration in 2019, I encourage all New Yorkers  not just those who are eligible to join us  to learn more about our advocacy, programs and benefits-assistance efforts.

And I encourage our current and former service members to reach out to our state headquarters or their local posts to learn more about how we can serve them.

 The American Legion Department of New York is proud to honor all who have served  regardless of branch, age, gender and background  and extend a hand to those who need it the most. We urge all New Yorkers to proudly do the same.

US Navy veteran Rena Nessler is the commander of the American Legion Department of New York."
2018-02-13,New York Post,Japanese Olympic speed skater suspended for doping,"Japanese short-track speed-skater Kei Saito was suspended from the Olympics Tuesday for using a banned substance.

The 21-year-old reserve skater on the mens 5,000-meter relay team tested positive for acetazolamide, a diuretic that can mask the presence of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs.

He agreed to voluntarily bow out of the games, but denied taking acetazolamide or any other drugs to gain a competitive edge.

I have never considered doping. I have never used anabolic steroids so I have never needed to try to hide it, Saito said in the statement. I do not want to be a disturbance to my teammates competing at the Olympic Games ... and will leave the team and the athletes village voluntarily.

He has also agreed to leave the Olympic Village as part of his provisional suspension, which is being reviewed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

He was expected to compete in the relays second heat Wednesday, but the International Olympic Committee, which tests athletes, found the drugs before he participated in any events.

Saito will also be barred from any international Skating Union competitions pending further investigation.

Acetazolamide  also called water pills  increases the volume of urine, effectively diluting it and making other banned substances tougher to detect, according to the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Russia was barred from this years games after the IOC uncovered a systematic, state-sanctioned doping scheme where agents swapped out about 100 steroid-using athletes urine samples for clean ones in the dead of night during the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

The scheme was uncovered in 2016, and Olympics officials stripped from Russia 11 of 33 medals the nation won at Sochi. Several athletes were also disqualified or banned, though 28 were eventually reinstated.

The IOC is allowing 169 Russian athletes to compete, but only as Olympic Athletes from Russia. They may not display the Russian flag, and the nations anthem will not be played during medal ceremonies."
2018-02-08,New York Post,Advertising staffers latest to bail on Newsweek,"It is now stampede for the exit time at Newsweek as staff defections from its journalism ranks are spreading to the advertising side.

Ed Hannigan, chief sales officer of Newsweek Media Group, is among the highest-ranking resignations from the business side in the wake of the turmoil that has rocked the company since a raid on its office last month.

I can confirm I resigned on Feb. 6, he said via e-mail.

Buzzfeed, citing a report from the Russia-based ad-fraud consultancy Social Puncher, said that NMG had been engaged in widespread ad fraud to boost its digital traffic numbers by using non-human bot sites to mimic real traffic and by buying traffic from pirate sites in non-English-speaking countries.

The company denied it was engaged in ad fraud but conceded it did buy a small amount of its traffic from third-party sites.

The journalism side has been in turmoil since Monday, when editor-in-chief Bob Roe, Executive Editor Kenneth Li and investigative reporter Celeste Katz were all fired.

They had been covering the Manhattan district attorneys investigation into Newsweek, and the coverage on Newsweeks own site apparently angered the ownership, who felt they had been treated unfairly.

Matt Cooper, one of the big-name journalists on staff, resigned on Monday following their ouster and sent a blistering resignation letter to CEO Dev Pragad.

Cooper was followed by Deputy Breaking News Editor Jason Silverstein on Wednesday. I have decided to leave Newsweek this week for reasons that should be obvious to anyone following the news about it, he wrote on Twitter.

On Thursday, two staffers who reported to Silverstein  breaking news reporters Sam Schwarz and Leah Thomas  resigned. So did another young reporter, Linley Sanders.

Opinion Editor Rachel Brody and reporter David Sirota also resigned on Wednesday.

Sources said that the DAs office is probing links between Newsweek Media Group  formerly known at IBT Media  and Olivet University, a fundamentalist Christian college based in San Francisco founded by followers of controversial Korean-American pastor Rev. David Jang.

Olivet has denied that there are financial links between the college and NMG. Last week, chairman Etienne Uzac  a co-founder of the company  resigned along with his wife, Marion Kim, the NMG director of finance.

On top of that, Chief Content Officer Dayan Candappa was suspended after allegations first divulged by Buzzfeed that he had been fired from his previous job at Reuters for allegedly stalking and harassing a female staffer who reported to him.

NMG said it has hired a law firm to investigate.

Meanwhile, Johnathan Davis, another company co-founder and the former chief content officer, returned on a temporary basis as the interim CCO.

Uzac and Davis had federal tax liens totaling $2 million, according to reports in Newsweek.

In a meeting with staffers on Wednesday, Davis urged staffers to figuratively join hands and cross the finish line together."
2018-10-10,New York Post,Theres a clear security winner between Apple and Android,"Are you an Apple person or an Android person? The question can determine who you date, how much you make in the markets  and how secure your data is.

Google released its Pixel 3 this week, a new smartphone running on Android that is known for its high-quality camera. But security on Android devices is a different issue entirely, security experts say. The Pixel is said to be the most secure device from Google yet, featuring a security chip that encrypts data on the device.

As the debate between Apple and Android rages on, here are some security differences to take into account between the two operating systems when youre considering a new phone:

There is a difference between privacy and security, said Jessica Ortega, a website security analyst at Scottsdale, Ariz.-based cloud-based security firm SiteLock. Privacy is how data is handled and stored, and in that realm, Apple is superior, she said.

When it comes to privacy, Android is still the second choice, she said. Androids requirement that data on mobile devices be transmitted to Google servers and used for targeted advertising and building a user profile, makes Android the more customizable, but less private mobile operating system.

Alternatively, Apple has been vocal about its commitment to data privacy, storing more data locally on the device and sending less to its server for ad targeting.

The narrative that some companies will try to get you to believe is Ive got to take all of your data to make my service better. Well, dont believe that. Whoevers telling you that  its a bunch of bunk, Apple CEO Tim Cook told Vice News Tonight.

Android collects and sells more data to advertisers, but which devices are less vulnerable to hacking? Apple once again, said Ortega. That is because Apples iOS has higher levels of scrutiny for what apps are allowed to be sold in the App Store.

Because Android prides itself on being open-source to a degree, their Play store is much easier to get apps added to and this has resulted in malicious apps slipping past security screenings, Ortega said. Contrary to Androids Play store, the app store for iPhones is much more restrictive, requiring in-depth security scanning of all applications before distribution.

In August, Google removed 145 Android applications from its Play app store after security firm Palo Alto Networks informed Google they were infected with malware and stealing data from users.

Googles Android platform is considered to be open-source with a much more accessible development platform and Play store. This means web developers can more easily create content and apps for Android phones, and that users can customize their devices more easily. Apple is much more restrictive, meaning fewer malicious apps, but also less customization for the end user.

Another downside to Android? Its infrequent software updates. In July 2015, a security researcher found a bug in the code of Android devices that left more than 950 million devices vulnerable to hackers. Bugs like these are exacerbated by the companys failure to push updates to users.

Google still has very little control over software updates, and Android users are basically at the mercy of their carriers and phone manufacturers when it comes to getting updates or new operating system versions, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a security reporter at VICEs Motherboard, wrote in his article Goodbye, Android, explaining why he switched to an iPhone.

In 2013, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to investigate wireless carriers including AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T Mobile for failing to inform customers that Googles Android system could be running without critical security updates.

Android smartphones that do not receive regular, prompt security updates are defective and unreasonably dangerous, the ACLU wrote.

Although by many of these measures, Apple is more secure, users have a responsibility to do more than just choose the smarter smartphone, said David Ginsburg, vice president of marketing at Cavirin, a Santa Clara, California, based cybersecurity company.

Securing your phone is just one aspect of ensuring your personal cyber posture, he said. On the privacy front, it is what applications you install and use, and having a good understand of their privacy policies.

Buying a more secure phone could protect you from malware and nefarious apps, but it wont protect you from data scandals like Facebooks recent breach with Cambridge Analytica, which affected 87 million users or phishing attacks, emails posing as legitimate sources to gain password information. To prevent ongoing security concerns like these, users should use basic digital hygiene like password managers and two-step verification.

The verdict? Apple is your best bet for built-in privacy, but you should take your own measures to prevent hacking of your devices even if you have faith in your phone system"

2018-04-24,New York Post,Allison Mack to be released on 5M bond in sex cult case,"Accused Nxivm sex-cult lieutenant Allison Mack is expected to be released on $5 million bond  and then be held under house arrest in California  while she awaits trial in Brooklyn Federal court on sex-trafficking and forced labor conspiracy charges for purported her role in the bizarre cult, a judge ruled at her bail hearing Tuesday.

Mack was also ordered not to have contact with any other members of the group, which reportedly includes Seagrams liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, Battlestar Galactica actress Nicki Clyne and India Oxenberg, the daughter of Dynasty star Catherine Oxenberg.

Basically, avoid contact with anyone you know associated in any way with Nxivm. Do you understand? Judge Viktor Pohorelsky told Mack.

Yes, your Honor, Mack responded, appearing nervous with her hands behind her back wearing khaki jail jumper and blue sneakers.

Her mom Melinda secured the bond using Macks house in upstate Clifton Park, her parents Los Alamitos, Calif., home and a retirement account. Mack was ordered to wear an ankle monitor. Officials are coordinating her release with agencies in California, where she will be staying, presumably with her parents.

Mack and Nxivm leader Keith Raniere allegedly kept women as slaves and branded them with Ranieres initials, prosecutors say.

Raniere was arrested in March, and Mack was arrested last week. Both have pleaded not guilty.

It is possible Mack has cut a deal with prosecutors to inform on Raniere. Her lawyers filed an affidavit Friday temporarily waving her right to a speedy trial as they are engaged in plea negotiations, which they believe are likely to result in a disposition of this case without trial.

Nxivm spokesman-turned-critic Frank Parlato said the apparent cooperation could be a ruse, but speculation by those around [Mack] is that she will wake up.

Her next court date is May 3."
2018-06-13,New York Post,Cuomo keeps dominant lead over Nixon poll,"Two-term incumbent Andrew Cuomo continues to hold a giant lead over rival Cynthia Nixon as the Democratic primary for governor heads into the summer months, according to a poll released Wednesday.

Cuomo is demolishing the Sex and the City actress 61 to 26 percent in the Sept. 13 race, the Siena College survey found.

The figures show Nixon  who launched her campaign in March  hasnt gained any ground in the last two months.

In April, the same poll put Cuomos lead at 58 to 27 percent.

The general election is shaping up to be more competitive, according to the pollsters.

Cuomo was still comfortably ahead of GOP rival Marc Molinaro, but by 19 points  56 to 37 percent.

Among Democrats, Cuomo led in every category and by a wider margin among women than men.

Women supported the governor 63 to 27 percent, while the split among men was 58 to 27 percent.

Cuomo led 63 to 23 percent in New York City and was whipping Nixon in the suburbs, 76 to 13 percent. She fared best upstate, where she trailed the incumbent 39 to 47 percent.

Nixon has a lot of catching up to do to make this race competitive. Cuomo is well known and well liked by New York Democrats, said pollster Steven Greenberg.

Things could get tighter in November.

Cuomo defeated Republican Rob Astorino 54 to 40 percent in 2014, a 14-point spread. A Siena poll in June of that year had Cuomo up by 26 points.

Siena surveyed 745 likely voters from June 4-7. The poll has a 3.6 percentage point margin of error."

2018-11-22,New York Post,New York State Senator Jose Peralta dead at age 47,"New York State Senator Jose Peralta died of an apparent heart attack late Wednesday night, friends and fellow lawmakers said. He was 47.

Peralta, a Democrat, represented a Queens district that included diverse neighborhoods such as Corona, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Woodside.

Tragic news about @SenatorPeralta, State Senator Mike Gianaris wrote on Twitter. My heart goes out to his family. Rest In Peace, Michael Blake, a current candidate for New York City Public Advocate said he was, Truly at a loss for words.

Peralta was the first Dominican-American elected to the State Senate in March 2010.

This fall, Peralta was defeated in a Democratic primary by Jessica Ramos. She then cruised to victory in the general election for Peraltas seat."
2018-11-10,New York Post,Rangers feel-good win streak ends in brutal fashion,"DETROIT  The answer is no, the Rangers did not have enough good feeling leftover to easily absorb this one.

That was exemplified when Henrik Lundqvist shattered his stick over the crossbar after his Rangers blew a two-goal lead in the third period and Dylan Larkin scored the game-winner with 5.1 seconds remaining in the 3-on-3 overtime to give the Red Wings a 3-2 victory on Friday night at Little Caesars Arena.

The loss snapped the Rangers four-game winning streak and left Lundqvist pretty darn upset in this season of rebuilding, which has not even reached Thanksgiving.

We played really well for a big part of this game, Lundqvist said. But this one hurts. ... Yeah.

Of course it hurts, because the Rangers (7-7-2) had convinced themselves that they knew how to close out games. Despite being a club that is focused more on the future than the present, they still believe they are good and can continue to win games. And they were doing that, opening their streak with two shootout wins in California followed by two more victories at the Garden earlier this week.

But all that good work can disappear quickly when a team plays a third period like th Rangers did, treating a 2-0 lead as if it didnt exist  and the mistakes were appalling and aplenty.

Just how we wilted, is what head coach David Quinn said was most disappointing. You think we learned lessons so far, and we just cheated the game. When you cheat the game with a 2-0 lead, you get that result. We got to learn lessons. Weve got to learn lessons. You cant cheat the game.

After the Red Wings (6-8-2) won for the fifth time in their past six games, Quinn further explained exactly what he meant by cheating the game.

When theres a 50-50 puck, were thinking offense. Making hope plays when we dont need to. Forcing plays. Didnt spend enough time in the offensive zone because when we got in the offensive zone, we tried to score a goal immediately instead of possessing it and understanding the situation, Quinn said. You dont want to play safe, but you want to play smart. We didnt do that.

The game changed dramatically early in the third period, when Brendan Smith made a ghastly turnover at the side of his net, allowing Justin Abdelkader to score and cut the Rangers lead to 2-1 at 1:36.

Their first goal changes everything, Quinn said. Just changes everything.

The Rangers kept giving the Wings opportunities, and they eventually cashed in on one when Andreas Athanasiou burned everyone up the left wing and beat Lundqvist with a tidy backhand with just 2:02 remaining in regulation.

Afterward, when someone started to ask Quinn if it was similar to something, he cut the questioner off.

L.A.? Its exactly what happened against L.A., he said, referring to the tying goal against the Kings on Oct. 28 in the game that immediately preceded the winning streak. We come on the ice and we stand in the neutral zone and they walk up the ice.

The game had started with the Rangers all over Detroit, forcing the Red Wings to turn the puck over like crazy. But Jimmy Howard did his regular Jimmy Howard Against the Rangers routine, eventually stopping 28-of-30 shots. The only two that beat him were screened shots on a four-minute power play late in the second period, when both Kevin Shattenkirk and Neal Pionk got long shots to go in during a span of 40 seconds. It was the third game in a row in which the Rangers scored twice in less than a minute, but it hardly carried over into the third.

Its hockey. If you expect the game to look the same way for 60 minutes, I dont think youve watched a hockey game before, Lundqvist said. Its going to happen. Its just frustrating the way it happened.

When Larkin then scored by finishing a nice crossing feed from Athanasiou just before the overtime horn sounded, the frustration boiled over for these still-learning Blueshirts, who have to put it behind them before Saturday nights game in Columbus, Ohio.

We cheated, Quinn said. Our mindset cheats and we got what we deserved."
2018-05-24,New York Post,Driver calls student fking Arab in racist road-rage rant,"A driver in Texas was caught on camera berating a college student about his ethnicity  telling him, This aint Pakistan, bitch and learn how to drive  during a dispute over tailgating.

This is America, dumbass ... We have rules in this fking country, shouted the unidentified Texan.

This is not Pakistan or Afghanistan or Kuwait, motherfker.

Sporting a cowboy hat and boots, the man went off on a three-minute tirade about the Texas A&M students driving and where he is from  even going so far as to call him a fking Arab.

You better learn how to drive in America, the man said.

Speaking to the Huffington Post, 24-year-old Ali Alghamdi described what was going through his head that day.

Honestly, I was scared, Alghamdi said of the May 4 incident.

I didnt know what this guy is capable of, he explained. But just because I look different, just because I sound different, doesnt mean you can attack me.

Alghamdi told HuffPost that the road rage dispute stemmed from a confrontation the pair had while driving in Kingsville, Tx. He claims that the other man ran a stop sign and then kept pumping his brakes  causing him to do the same.

He asked me couple of times to get out of my car, Alghamdi wrote on YouTube, where the footage was first posted.

Kingsville police are aware of the video and are reportedly pursuing disorderly conduct charges against the man. The driver was initially the one who called 911, but authorities quickly realized he was in the wrong after watching the footage.

Thats when the whole process changed 180 degrees, Alghamdi said.

The engineering student firmly believes that the only reason the driver called him out was because of his ethnicity."
2018-08-23,New York Post,Staten Island kids down but not out at Little League World Series,"SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.  Theyre down, but not out.

Staten Islands Mid-Island baseball team suffered a heart-wrenching loss Tuesday night against Hawaii  and now must win Thursday night against Georgia in the consolation bracket in order to stay alive in the Little League World Series.

Sometimes you need a game like this to kick you in the butt, said Christine Mendez, mother of Derek Mendez, who stroked the only hit of the game for Mid-Island, which lost 10-0.

One game doesnt define who they are, Christine said.

Mid-Island Manager Joe Calabrese was disappointed with the boys performance in Williamsport, but remained hopeful.

We played nowhere near our best today, he said. Everything kind of snowballed on us. [But] we start a new sheet tomorrow.

Calabrese told reporters that he felt his team got rattled by Hawaiis power hitters, who put up seven runs in the first two innings thanks in part to Sean Yamaguchis grand-slam home run.

By the end of the third, Mid-Island was already down 9-0.

Calabrese noted how his team was tense before the game.

They are 13 years old and I think they were intimidated for some reason, he said.

If Mid-Island can win Thursday evening, the team will play Hawaii again in the US-bracket Championship game Saturday. But pitching ace Gregory Bruno, who threw 85 pitches in Sundays game, cant pitch for four full days due to Little League rules and wont be on the mound Thursday against Georgia.

Goal is to get to the last game with our guy on the mound, Calabrese said of Bruno, who would be eligible to pitch Sunday against the winner of the International Championship game.

Well come back and beat them in a championship game, Calabrese said. Were gonna have to play a perfect game to beat them."
2018-11-16,New York Post,PSAL wont let Success Academys track squad compete,"Success Academys running battle with the Department of Education has spilled over into athletics.

The charter operators high-school track squad cant compete in public-school meets this year after they were denied recognition by the Public Schools Athletic League, officials said.

Despite fielding several standouts  including one of the states top sprinters in junior Ronne Bailey  the team is losing visibility and scholarship opportunities, Success officials said.

We just want these kids to be able to compete with their peers, said coach and Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn native Ozzie Henderson, 28, who ran collegiate track at La Salle University in Philadelphia.

The Success Academy HS of the Liberal Arts is co-located with three traditional public high schools at the Norman Thomas campus in Midtown.

The four schools applied to create a PSAL-eligible track team but were rejected, Henderson said. Per PSAL rules, schools that share a building must compete as one entity.

Unable to compete in regular city meets, the schools track athletes have been forced to operate on a far more limited  and less prestigious  club-team basis.

Bailey, whose best 200-meter time ranked second in the state among all sophomores last year, according to Henderson, said her team deserved inclusion. We work really hard, she said. We want the chance to be out there.

Henderson said the junior will likely qualify for an athletic scholarship to a Division I college  but that her lack of exposure is hampering the process.

Ronne will be OK, he said. But there are other people on the team who are going to miss out on opportunities to smaller programs because they arent being seen.

The PSAL told the network that the campus already had several sports teams that included Success Academy students  and that they had to prioritize needier schools.

They also cited financial concerns  and that they were focusing on schools with high female enrollment.

Given limited resources, not all PSAL team applications can realistically be approved, the DOE said.

Success officials countered that the Norman Thomas campus has six teams  still a pittance compared to more prominent schools like Brooklyn Tech that field teams ranging from bowling to badminton.

The PSAL has come under fire in recent months over limited athletic offerings at city schools.

DOE spokeswoman Miranda Barbot said all applications are fairly reviewed and that they are assessing a new outdoor track team at the Norman Thomas campus for the spring."
2018-08-15,New York Post,Man admits to killing pregnant girlfriend before driving into river cops,"Arkansas cops on Tuesday released a chilling 911 call made after a man killed his pregnant girlfriend  and just before he committed suicide by driving into the Mississippi River on Sunday.

The Phillips County Sheriffs Office told FOX13 that Cornell Henry, 38, called 911 after killing his girlfriend, 20-year-old Cherrkisha Jones.

In the phone call obtained by FOX13, Henry can be heard telling a dispatcher he killed Jones. Authorities said he then drove into the Mississippi River in Helena-West Helena, Ark., located about 70 miles southwest of Memphis.

This is Cornell Henry, and I just killed somebody  and I am about to kill myself, he can be heard saying in the phone call.

He also warned dispatchers that any attempt to stop him was too late, and that he killed his girlfriend because she had been playing games.

By the time they get out here it will be too late anyway. Only thing they can do is drag her body out of the river because she is already dead, he told dispatchers.

Phillips County Sheriff Neal Byrd told FOX13 there was an argument before the murder-suicide, which may have centered around Jones possibly dating someone else.

Authorities said there was a history of domestic violence between the pair, and that a bullet fragment was retrieved from the car after it was dragged out of the river.

This is something that has really traumatized this community, Byrd told WMC-TV. Never would we have expected for anything like this to happen."
2018-04-19,New York Post,3 cops suspended after sleazy romps with civilian employee,"Three cops in Montana have been suspended without pay for having sex with a former civilian police department employee, including some on-duty romps in the basement of City Hall, authorities said.

Billings Police Chief Rich St. John on Wednesday declined to name the three veteran male officers, but identified the woman they had sex with as Rawlyn Strizich, who was fired in February after admitting she stole prescription painkillers from the departments evidence room, Last Best News reports.

Were talking really good officers who made a bad decision  a really, really bad decision, St. John told the online news site.

Two of the officers were docked two weeks pay for having sex with Strizich in the departments record storage room in the basement of City Hall. The third cop was suspended without pay for one week after having sex while off duty with Strizich inside a city-owned police patrol car  or close to it, St. John said.

The officers have admitted to the encounters, which occurred from mid-2016 through early 2017, the Billings Gazette reports. St. John downplayed the trysts during an interview with the newspaper, saying they had nothing to do with the earlier theft at the evidence facility.

Were basically talking about no criminal offenses, St. John told the newspaper. Were talking about policy violations that fall into moral turpitude. What I disciplined them for is basically rules of conduct, that officers and the general public would not think that this behavior and location specifically would be appropriate.

St. John said he had to schedule the suspensions due to staff shortages and noted the potential loss of investment in the officers had they been fired. All of the officers are remorseful for their conduct, he said.

I look at their work that they have done, whether theyre salvageable, the time thats elapsed with this thing, St. John told the Billings Gazette. We have a lot of money invested in these people, and if theyre salvageable, we want to do that. I also want them to learn that this isnt acceptable behavior and send a message to the rest of the department that this is unacceptable."
2018-07-19,New York Post,Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio turned down Brokeback Mountain,"Dont Worry, He Wont Get Far on Foot director Gus Van Sant revealed in an interview with IndieWire that both Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio passed on Brokeback Mountain, the gay love story that snagged eight Academy Award nominations in 2006  the most of any film that year.

Van Sant, who was approached to direct the film that was ultimately helmed by Ang Lee, recalled the lack of interest from actors in portraying the roles that earned Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger widespread acclaim and accolades.

Nobody wanted to do it, Van Sant said. I was working on it, and I felt like we needed a really strong cast, like a famous cast. That wasnt working out. I asked the usual suspects: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Ryan Phillippe. They all said no.

Diana Ossana, who produced the film with James Schamus for Focus Features, confirmed Van Sants casting revelations in an email sent to IndieWire.

Yes, all those young gentlemen (at the time) turned down the project, for various reasons, she wrote. Ossana also adapted the script with Larry McMurtry from a short story by Annie Proulx.

Of the two leading men, Ledgers role was the more difficult to fill, according to Ossana. Casting Ennis in particular was the ultimate hurdle, she said.

Looking back on the lack of enthusiasm surrounding the films casting process at the time, Van Sant said, What I could have done, and what I probably should have done, was cast more unknowns, not worried about who were the lead actors.

He continued, I was not ready. Im not sure why. There was just sort of a hiccup on my part. There was something off with myself, I guess, whatever was going on.

The My Own Private Idaho director also shared that one of his producer friends offered him Call Me By Your Name, which later went to Luca Guadagnino. I think in that case in particular ... I dont think it would have panned out the way it did if I had directed it. I think it was great, he said. I like the film. I think the sentimentality and the ending of the film was something that probably wasnt in the book in the same way. It maybe was in the book, but I think that he got something really great that I think is very ... Im not sure I would have ended up in the same place, so it probably wouldnt have done as well.

2018-07-11,New York Post,Dunkin Brands names David Hoffmann new CEO,"Dunkin Brands Group on Wednesday said David Hoffmann would succeed Nigel Travis as chief executive officer effectively immediately.

Travis, who held the post for nearly a decade, will become executive chairman of the board and remain actively involved with the company, which includes the Dunkin Donuts coffee chain and Baskin-Robbins ice cream chain.

The company also said Hoffmann will keep his present role as president of Dunkin Donuts US.

Hoffmanns appointment comes at a time when competition between restaurant chains has intensified, especially in the breakfast meal category, with McDonalds and Burger King offering dollar menus and other low-price deals.

When we recruited Dave to Dunkin Brands 18 months ago with the intent that he would succeed me as CEO, we knew that we were getting a world-class leader with extensive restaurant industry expertise, and he has exceeded all of our expectations, Travis said.

Under Travis, Dunkin has expanded its overseas presence by entering 25 new markets and adding 6,000 restaurants.

Travis also oversaw a successful Nasdaq listing in 2011 and grew the companys revenue by 60 percent since he took up the role in 2009.

The companys stock is up nearly three-fold since it debuted at an IPO price of $19."
2018-08-01,New York Post,Coachs ex-wifes abuse texts put Urban Meyer in crosshairs,"Urban Meyer has some explaining to do.

The Ohio State football coach said last week he had no knowledge about a pair of alleged domestic violence incidents involving his former assistant coach Zach Smith  who was fired last week after the cases became public  but text messages surfaced Wednesday indicating both Meyer and his wife, Shelley, were aware dating back to 2015.

Courtney Smith, the ex-wife of the former Buckeyes wide receivers coach, shared text messages with college football reporter Brett McMurphy that go against what Meyer claimed he knew.

All the [coaches] wives knew, Courtney told McMurphy. They all did. Every single one.

Meyer was asked about the allegations last week at Big Ten Media Day, but said if he had known, he would have fired Smith back in 2015.

I was never told about anything, Meyer told reporters. Never anything came to light, never had a conversation about it. So I know nothing about it. I asked people back at the office to call and see what happened, and they came back and said they know nothing.

I dont know who creates a story like that, Meyer added about the 2015 allegations.

The text messages provided by Courtney show that Shelley Meyer  a registered nurse and instructor of Clinical Practice at Ohio States college of nursing  and other wives of Ohio State coaches knew about the domestic violence incidents for years. Courtney also said she shared with them pictures of bruises on her neck and arms from past beatings.

Shelley said she was going to have to tell Urban, Courtney said. I said: Thats fine, you should tell Urban. I know Shelley did everything she could.

While the abuse allegedly dates back to 2009, texts show that Courtney began discussing the issues with wives of coaches in 2015. She called the police after an incident that October, when Smith allegedly shoved her against the wall with his hands around her neck, something he did very often, Courtney said.

I am with you! Shelley Meyer allegedly wrote to Courtney in a 2015 text. A lot of women stay hoping it will get better. I dont blame you! But just want u to be safe. Do you have a restraining order? He scares me

Further texts between Courtney and Lindsey Voltolini  the wife of Brian Voltolini, Ohio States director of football operations and a longtime member of Meyers staff  show Meyer spoke to Smith about the 2015 incident.

He [Urban] just said he [Zach] denied everything, Lindsey allegedly wrote to Courtney.

Smith is the grandson of former Ohio State coach Earle Bruce, who was a mentor to Meyer. Smith has never been convicted of domestic violence, though he was arrested in 2009 for aggravated battery on a pregnant victim following a fight with Courtney. The incident happened the night of a party that Meyer threw for his coaches, including Smith, while they were at Florida.

According to Courtney, two of Meyers closest friends asked her to drop the charges from that event, which she ultimately agreed to.

In November 2015, with the alleged abuse still going on, Courtney filed for divorce. Smiths attorney allegedly had the divorce documents sealed without Courtneys consent, but they were unsealed and released Wednesday morning.

Zach once told me, Courtney said, if he ever got fired and this all comes out: Ill take everyone at Ohio State down with me."

2018-10-27,New York Post,Cadets in elite Junior ROTC unit branded high schooler on the butt,"An elite unit of the Junior ROTC at Francis Lewis HS in Queens has been disbanded after cadets allegedly branded a fellow member on the butt, The Post has learned.

The shocking incident involved the Raiders, a military-style athletic squad. It is one team among several in the schools Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps, one of the biggest programs in the nation.

The alleged skin-scorching occurred during an overnight stay in April at the Hilton Garden Inn in Westampton Township, NJ, near the Fort Dix military base, city Department of Education and police officials said.

It did not come to light until the summer  after the teen victims parents learned about it, according to school insiders.

The Westampton Police Department and the Burlington County Prosecutors Office are investigating the alleged hazing.

Ent said the students behind was burned with some kind of hot iron.

The students outraged parents are considering bringing charges, according to three people with ties to the Fresh Meadows school.

At least two boys on the team have received a superintendents suspension, one said. The ouster, up to a year, is the highest level of student discipline in the city DOE.

In an Oct. 11 e-mail to staff, Francis Lewis principal David Marmor gave few details: An allegation was made that during an overnight trip, last school year with the JROTC Raiders, there was inappropriate behavior by some of our students. The matter is currently under investigation by the NJ Police Department and by the NYC DOE.

He added, Pending the outcome of the investigations, all Raider activities have been suspended. We will not be planning, organizing or practicing for any upcoming Raider competitions.

However the probe will not affect other JROTC activities such as drill, leadership and academic teams, Marmor said.

DOE rep Miranda Barbot called the allegations deeply troubling, and said the school took disciplinary action once the allegations were reported.

The Raiders team takes part in physical-fitness competitions against JROTC programs at other schools. Cadets wear Army fatigues and race through rope courses, climb walls, and carry canoes or other objects through woods and creeks.

Members of the close-knit group were tight-lipped.

Im not going to tell you anything, said a student who was reportedly suspended. If you want something from me, go talk to my parents. Dont talk to me. The students parents could not be reached.

Col. Albert Lahood, a DOE teacher and the programs senior military instructor in the US Army-sponsored program, did not return messages.

Sgt. Lawrence Badia, who was supervising rifle drills on Friday, only told The Post: Its a serious allegation. Im concerned.

PTA mom Lisa Lovett said the principal told her he expects criminal charges.

Some of the kids, I believe the victims, are bringing charges, she said.

Teachers at the 4,500-student campus said the JROTCs popularity has boosted Francis Lewis success and prestige.

This is a great program that has been very good for our school, a teacher, Arthur Goldstein, said. The program does a lot of good for a lot of kids, and doesnt push them to join the military. Kids take so much pride in this program. ROTC teens, in general, are the best-behaved kids.

Teachers who serve as JROTC instructors are dedicated and hard-working, Goldstein said, and they would be horrified by anything so barbaric.

I am absolutely sure none of them would tolerate anything like that."
2018-04-22,New York Post,Several killed after gunman opens fire at Waffle House cops,"Four people were killed and four others injured when a semi-naked gunman burst into a Waffle House in the Nashville area and opened fire early Sunday, according to reports.

The gunfire erupted about 3:30 a.m. at the Waffle House at 3571 Murfreesboro Pike, where a customer managed to wrestle away the gunmans rifle before he fled on foot, Metro Nashville police said on Twitter.

Police said they were looking for 29-year-old Travis Reinking of Morton, Illinois, as a person of interest in the shooting. They identified him based on the vehicle he drove to the eatery.

Police described the weapon used as an AR-15 assault rifle, WSMV reported.

Four people were injured in the shooting in Antioch, Tenn., a suburban neighborhood about 12 miles from downtown Nashville.

Three victims were transported to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where one person died, the Tennessean reported.

One person remains in critical condition and another is in critical but stable condition, according to hospital spokeswoman Jennifer Wetzel.

The suspect, who is white, was wearing only a green jacket at the time of the shooting, but was otherwise naked.

He removed the jacket after the shooting, police said, later adding that he was last seen walking on Mountain Springs Drive near the Waffle House.

The man was seen wearing black pants and no shirt, police tweeted in an update.

Keep your doors locked, keep your eyes open. If you see this individual  if you see a nude guy walking around this morning  call the police department immediately, police spokesman Don Aaron said, according to CNN.

The man who wrestled the gun away is a hero, he added.

Mayor David Briley called it a tragic day for our city anytime people lose their lives at the hands of a gunman.

My heart goes out to the families and friends of every person who was killed or wounded in this mornings shooting, Briley said in a statement. I know all of their lives will be forever changed by this devastating crime.

Theres clearly more to be said about these circumstances, but for now I ask Nashville to pray for and rally around these victims and join me in thanking the Metro Nashville Police Department as it works to find and apprehend the shooter.

The shooting took place less than two miles from the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ, where a woman was killed and several others wounded when a gunman opened fire on Sept. 24.

Emanuel Kidega Samson, 26, has been charged in the mass shooting."
2018-10-02,New York Post,Video of airport baggage handlers flinging luggage sparks outrage,"A video of Cathay Pacific Airways luggage handlers flinging checked bags at an airport in Hong Kong has gone viral on social media and sparked outrage among travelers everywhere.

In the 37-second clip, two luggage handlers at Hong Kong International Airport are seen throwing checked items from a conveyer belt into a cart. The men throw suitcases, cardboard boxes and what appear to be fragile items that are being unloaded from the plane that just landed in Hong Kong Thursday morning.

Marcela Fernanda Solis Walker recorded the video after she had deplaned from her flight from Xiamen to Hong Kong and uploaded it to Facebook, where it went viral with over 5 million views.

This [is] the way that our beloved luggage is treated!! she wrote.

Since going viral, the woman told South China Morning Post that she doesnt have any intention to make any trouble to the workers.

I only wanted other people to be aware of the situation, she said.

However, those on social media have responded angrily at the video, calling it disgusting and saying the men were lazy.

They should get terminated in that company for they cant work properly for that position.. one person wrote on Facebook.

I seriously hope this video has been shared to and seen by their employer, another commented.

The staff in the video were identified by the Post as part of Hong Kong Airport Services, owned by Cathay Pacific Airways. The airport services team has been awarded the passenger handling permit since 2008, the Post reports.

A spokesperson for the service provider told the Post that the company was aware of the viral video and had taken the matter up with the supplier involved.

We sincerely apologize to the passengers of our customer airlines in this particular incident, the spokesman said, the Post reports."
2018-05-01,New York Post,Kochs university donations bought influence in hiring firing faculty,"FAIRFAX, Va.  Virginias largest public university granted the conservative Charles Koch Foundation a say in the hiring and firing of professors in exchange for millions of dollars in donations, according to newly released documents.

The release of donor agreements between George Mason University and the foundation follows years of denials by university administrators that Koch foundation donations inhibit academic freedom.

University President Angel Cabrera wrote a note to faculty Friday night saying the agreements fall short of the standards of academic independence I expect any gift to meet. The admission came three days after a judge scrutinized the universitys earlier refusal to release any documents.

The newly released agreements spell out million-dollar deals in which the Koch Foundation endows a fund to pay the salary of one or more professors at the universitys Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank. The agreements require creation of five-member selection committees to choose the professors and grant the donors the right to name two of the committee members.

The Koch Foundation enjoyed similar appointment rights to advisory boards that had the right under the agreements to recommend firing a professor who failed to live up to standards.

Cabrera emphasized in his note to faculty that the agreements did not give donors control over academic decisions  an apparent reference to the fact that the Koch Foundation did not control a majority of seats on the selection committees.

A university spokesman said Cabrera was unavailable for an interview. On Monday night, Cabrera issued a statement saying he is ordering a review of all the universitys donor agreements that support faculty positions to ensure that they do not grant donors undue influence in academic matters.

Cabreras admission that the agreements fall short of standards for academic independence is a stark departure from his earlier statements on the issue. In a 2014 blog post on the issue, he wrote that donors dont get to decide who is hired and that these rules are an essential part of our academic integrity. If these rules are not acceptable, we simply dont accept the gift. Academic freedom is never for sale. Period.

In 2016, in an interview with The Associated Press, he denied that the Koch donations restricted academic independence and said Kochs status as a lightning rod for his support of Republican candidates is the only reason people question the donations.

The documents were released to a former student, Samantha Parsons, under a Freedom of Information Act request she filed earlier this year after years of having similar requests rejected.

Parsons, who now works for the activist group UnKoch My Campus, said the documents are strikingly similar to agreements the Koch Foundation made with Florida State University that caused a similar uproar.

She said provisions giving the foundation a say in which professors are chosen are especially alarming.

The faculty is supposed to have the independence to choose the best-qualified candidate, she said.

The Koch Foundation issued a statement saying the agreements with Mason are old and inactive and that newer agreements contain no such provisions.

We took criticism of our agreements seriously when similar concerns were raised about the Florida State deal in 2008, the foundations director of university relations, John Hardin, said in the statement.

Mason, which has developed a reputation over the years as a conservative powerhouse in law and economics, has received increased scrutiny about its connections to the Koch Foundation since 2016, when Mason renamed its law school for conservative jurist Antonin Scalia. A 2016 analysis by the AP found that Mason received more money from the foundation than any school in the country.

UnKoch My Campus released documents on Monday that spell out some of the details of the donation leading to renaming of the law school for Scalia, which occurred in conjunction with a $10 million donation from the Koch Foundation and $20 million from an anonymous donor.

The newly released emails are heavily redacted and do not expose the donor, but they do show that Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society, is described as a representative of the donor.

Emails between Leo and the Mason law schools dean, Henry Butler, show Leo inquiring on behalf of law school applicants and expressing approval of faculty hires.

In one email, Butler informs Leo of a unanimous faculty vote in favor of hiring a new member of the law school faculty, to which Leo replies Great! The faculty member later went on leave to join the Trump administration.

In a 2015 email, Leo informs Butler about a student prospect who has been working at RAGA, the Republican Attorney General Association, and who is looking to apply to Masons law school. Leo asks if Butler will meet the prospect and Butler replies, Absolutley! (sic) I will work with the admissions office to make sure we get together.

Bethany Letiecq, president of the American Association of University Professors at GMU, said in a statement that the Scalia school documents confirm what many faculty have suspected for years.

Private donors have been provided influence over faculty affairs at our public university, she said. This is a violation of the public trust.

Del. Marcus Simon, a Fairfax County Democrat who helped lead a petition effort in 2016 to block the name change, said he is not surprised to see the level of influence granted to the donors in these agreements.

The idea that the Kochs are giving money without anything expected in return always seemed a little absurd, he said.

He said the university should release all of its agreements with the Koch Foundation, including its most recent ones."
2018-09-28,New York Post,How Jennifer Beals helped launch Crazy Legs Colon to break-dancing stardom,"Its pretty hard to recognize Bronx-born break-dancing god Richard Crazy Legs Colon  president of the legendary Rock Steady Crew  during one of the biggest moments of his career.

Thats because hes disguised as a back-spinning body double for star Jennifer Beals in the climactic audition scene of the 1983 hit Flashdance. After Beals female dance doubles couldnt master the move that he attempted to teach them, then-16-year-old Crazy Legs stepped up. Which meant me dressing in leotards, tights, Capezios, wearing a wig, he tells The Post.

The most devastating thing was they wanted me to shave my peach fuzz that was first growing in, and Im like, Yo, youre asking me to shave these hairs I was waiting for!

But you wont have any trouble making out Crazy Legs, now 52, when the Hispanic Heritage Awards ceremony airs on PBS on Friday. The Puerto Rican B-boy was honored at the event, held Sept. 12 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, with a Heritage Award for Culture for his trailblazing moves.

Its been 41 years since Crazy Legs discovered what was known simply as breaking in the nascent years of hip-hop, when he saw his oldest brother, Robert Colon, doing it. I didnt understand why my brother was throwing himself on the floor and embarrassing my family in front of our home, says Crazy Legs, who was living with his mother and four other siblings in The Bronx.

But a year later, he was changing his tune. My cousin Lenny Len brought me to a jam on 180th Street and Crotona Avenue, and it was the first time I had witnessed what eventually became known as hip-hop. I was blown away. I felt like I came to life on that day.

Crazy Legs began practicing  and perfecting  breaking moves such as the back spin, the swipe and the W, pushing them to new levels of difficulty. He joined the then-2-year-old Rock Steady Crew in 1979, when he was only 12. The retirement age for a B-boy  which, he explains, originally stood for Bronx boy  was 16 to 17 years old back then. This was a kids thing.

After moving to Inwood with his family, Crazy Legs earned his name while attending JHS 52. There was this girl who was captain of the cheerleaders, he says. After school, shes looking at me practice doing my thing, and she goes, Ooh, he got some crazy legs! And the cheerleaders started calling me Crazy Legs.

Meanwhile, his reputation on the streets was growing. It got to a point where people would hear about me, or I would hear about them, and I would find them to battle, he says. And Id smoke them.

The Rock Steady Crew  which Crazy Legs has been president of since 1981  also gained more notoriety, performing in New York hot spots such as Negril, Danceteria and the Roxy. Then came appearances in movies including Flashdance, Wild Style, also from 1983, and 1984s Beat Street.

They even went on to bust their moves for the Queen of England. We were like these little rock stars, Crazy Legs says.

But later in the 80s, he says, things started tapering off. Now certain people are considering the dancing stuff passe. One moment youre being [let] through those velvet ropes and the next thing you know youre being told to hit the back of the line at a club that you helped to make famous.

But after struggling for a few years, Crazy Legs decided to start using his talent to help kids, through dance and hip-hop, at the Point Community Development Corporation in The Bronx. More recently, hes used his platform to benefit Puerto Rico  where he has a home  helping with the relief effort after Hurricane Maria.

While he retired from competition two years ago, Crazy Legs  who now lives in Hudson County, NJ, with his girlfriend of 16 years and has a 21-year-old son who is a senior at Cornell University  continues to teach break dancing around the world. Im still involved with the art, man, he says.

But as far as those legendary moves go, he says, I gotta keep it cute where I [wont] get hurt."
2018-10-24,New York Post,Suspiria is the freaky ballet horror reboot we all deserve,"Director Luca Guadagnino pirouettes far from the easy-living, Italian-countryside romance of last years masterpiece Call Me By Your Name for an arthouse-meets-Grand Guignol reboot of one of the freakiest horror movies to come out of the 1970s.

And he pulls it off in delicious, gut-punching style. Here, he expands the story around a Midwestern ingenue (Dakota Johnson) who enrolls at a renowned ballet school in Berlin only to find whats going on behind the scenes is more than your typical theatrical magic.

Tilda Swinton pulls impressive triple duty, playing head teacher Madame Blanc, elderly therapist Dr. Josef Klemperer (billed in the credits as Lutz Ebersdorf) and Helena Markos, whom fans of the original will know as the leader of the schools coven of witches.

Johnson holds her own as newcomer Susie Bannion, the mysteriously fast-rising star, while Chloe Grace Moretz appears as a tormented former student. The finale should have you clutching your face Home Alone style as Guadagnino goes totally for broke. Call it the spooky-season version of A Star Is Born (and one with a lot more kick, if you ask me)."
2018-04-22,New York Post,Facebook is actually stalking everyone,"Facebook is stalking you, even if youre not signed up  and it really, really doesnt want to stop.

The latest proof, notes Bloomberg Views Leonid Bershidsky, came just days after CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress how hard the company struggles to stay transparent, and after Facebook announced its intent to give all users the protections ordered in Europe by the EUs new General Data Protection Directive.

That proof is Facebooks quiet word that it will shift its terms of service to move all non-European users into the jurisdiction of its US headquarters, rather than its international HQ in Dublin.

The change means the EU rules, which kick in May 25, wont protect users on five continents as they otherwise wouldve.

Lawyers may have demanded the move, since violations of the GDPD could cost Facebook more than $1 billion in fines. But Zuck admitted to Congress that hes already letting lawyers make too many calls: Long privacy policies are confusing, which is one of the things weve struggled with over time  without ending the confusion.

But thats not the only way Facebook falls down: Its nearly impossible to figure out how to turn off any of its data-collection features  and actually impossible to turn off some.

Even if you tell it to stop using your data to select which ads you see, Facebook still stalks you on the Web to build its profile of your preferences  keeping track in case you change your mind?

Then again, Zuckerberg admitted that his company tracks countless non-members across the Net, though he denied knowing the term shadow profile  the common tech-world phrase for info gathered on folks you havent signed up.

For that matter, Facebook also uses facial-recognition data without your explicit opt-in consent  one of countless exploits that the EU rules will forbid.

And its all about driving up the companys advertising revenues  its true Holy Grail, for all Zucks talk of building a global community that works for everyone.

That drive is also surely behind a complaint weve been hearing from more and more writers: Though you can have thousands of followers  people whove actively told Facebook they want to see your posts linking to your writings  those posts still dont pop up in many feeds.

It seems the companys algorithms discriminate against anything that might move you to spend much online time away from Facebook (unless youre sent there by a paid ad).

At some point, this hunger for advertising cash is going to produce a global community that works for . . . no one."
2018-07-04,New York Post,School counselor to plead guilty to sexually assaulting girl during therapy session,"A former high school guidance counselor in New Hampshire accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl will likely take a plea deal to lesser charges next week, according to a report.

Kristie Torbick, 39, is expected to plead guilty on Monday to four counts of felonious sexual assault in connection to incidents involving a female student at Exeter High School between December 2016 and January 2017, the Union Leader reported.

Torbick, of Lee, surrendered to police in Exeter a short time after the alleged trysts when investigators were alerted to reports of sexual misconduct at the school. Torbick, a first-year employee at the school, spent five years previously as a counselor in Bedford, where a school superintendent said she had a great record, according to the newspaper.

Torbick was indicted last year on a total of nine counts, including four counts of felonious sexual assault and three counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, the Bangor Daily News reports. She allegedly engaged in sexual penetration with the 14-year-old student on Dec. 30, 2016, as well as other sexual acts that took place in Exeter and Epping.

Torbick also engaged in similar sex acts with the teen a week later while in Lee, where she provided therapy [to the victim], according to court documents that also allege Torbick had the girl perform a sex act on her.

Prosecutors will ask a judge for a five- to 10-year prison sentence for Torbick. Assistant County Attorney Melissa Foles said the remaining charges will be dismissed in exchange for her guilty plea to four counts of felonious sexual assault.

An attorney for Torbick, who is no longer employed by New Hampshire School Administrative Unit 16, indicated to a judge in a notice of intent to plead guilty last month that he will seek to have her prison sentence suspended for 10 years.

Torbick will also be required to register as a sex offender and have no communication with the alleged victim or unsupervised contact with children under the age of 18 except her own children, the Union Leader reports."

The study, by language-learning app Babbel and hostel chain Generator Hostels, quizzed 500 workers at hostels across Europe about which US twangs get their motors running  and found a whopping 57 percent of French workers and 19 percent of Italians are aroused when someone purrs, Hey, Im walkin here! in their ear.

Swedes, however, said Fuhgeddaboudit! to anyone who actually says Fuhgeddaboudit!  they voted the Big Apple enunciation as the least attractive.

Across the board, Southern accents were the most popular  especially with the Irish  with New York in a respectable second place, while the fewest number of Europeans overall said You betcha! to Minnesotan.

The majority of British respondents close their eyes and think of England when they hear Southern Californians.

And Germans and Spaniards were mysteriously most aroused by Bostons distinctive timbre, according to the report."

2018-08-14,New York Post,Plenty of creative ways to cash in on Yankees still remain,"LAS VEGAS  Though the Red Sox have virtually clinched the American League East division already, betting markets still have the second-place Yankees high on the list of potential pennant and world championship contenders.

That may surprise skeptics. The Yankees have been badly outplayed by Boston in recent weeks. That includes a four-game series sweep at Fenway. Worse, as a wild card, the Yankees probably would have to beat the Athletics or Mariners in a one-game showdown just to earn a spot in a best-of-five series against ... the Red Sox! Boston is the clear front-runner for the No. 1 seed ahead of Houston, and is currently positioned to draw the wild-card survivor.

Quite a gauntlet for the Bronx Bombers. Lets see if current market prices properly reflect the magnitude of that challenge:

Remember that sports books create a universe larger than 100 percent to represent a house edge. Most respected analytics projections have the Red Sox in the range of 90-95 percent to win the AL East given developments of the past month or so. William Hill is in line with that at -1700 (you have to risk $1,700 to win $100 if you bet on Boston to win the division).

Despite whats shaping up as a brutal pathway to the pennant that starts with a wild-card game, the Yankees are still perceived by William Hill odds as having a one-in-four chance to reach the World Series:

Much bigger house edge here, as those six obvious contenders add up to 134 percent. That by itself suggests theres not much value betting any of the options. If youd like to bet the Yankees to win the AL, you can wait until the regular season ends to make sure everyones healthy ... bet the Yankees on the money line in the wild-card game ... roll that over into a series bet on the Yankees over the Red Sox ... and roll that over into a series bet on the Yankees over the winner of the West versus Central battle. Your yield will likely be much better than 3/1 with that strategy.

Mathematically, that general strategy would work better with any of those teams. Pencil in the Athletics as a wild card. Think of the parlay profit that would come from underdog returns in an upset at Yankee Stadium, a series upset of Boston, and a smaller series upset in the ALCS. Thats going to return a lot better than 5/1, and you get to wait and make sure the As avoid injuries and reach the postseason.

Because the NL playoff picture is so crowded, the Yankees are still one of the top choices to win it all:

The top dozen teams add up to 122 percent already. A few longer shots like the Nationals, Cardinals and Rockies have chances above 1 percent as well.

Interestingly, while the Red Sox hold a 94-10 percent edge over the Yankees to capture the division, their market advantages are only 37-25 percent to win the American League, and 22-14 percent to win the world championship.

Hope is not lost for Yankees fans. Its just going to sit on the back burner for several weeks. Time for the franchise to develop a gauntlet strategy while hoping the Red Sox peaked several weeks too early. And, time for handicappers to determine whether or not the Yankees truly deserve so much market respect in a loaded bracket."

2018-02-13,New York Post,Rose McGowan skipping out on media conference,"Rose McGowan will not be taking the stage down in Huntington Beach on Tuesday as previously planned. The Brave author has canceled her scheduled appearance at the Code Conference, Deadline has confirmed.

It follows an announcement by the Citizen Rose star on February 2 that she was walking away from more scheduled media appearances after a highly charged incident with an abrasive audience member at a New York City Barnes & Noble on January 31.

It also follows the sudden death of McGowans former manager Jill Messick last week after the disgraced Harvey Weinstein made public in late January emails from Messick and Ben Affleck to refute McGowans allegations of a 1997 sexual assault. Messicks family called Weinsteins actions a desperate attempt to vindicate himself and said the ploy devastated Messick. On February 10, McGowan expressed to the family her wishes of solace during this pain for them.

McGowans role in the media-heavy Code Media conference being held this week at the Pasea Hotel & Spa was first announced January 30. That was the same day her E! docuseries Citizen Rose debuted and her now-bestselling book hit the shelves.

2018-05-18,New York Post,Michael B Jordan grappled with racial tension for Fahrenheit 451,"Michael B. Jordan is only 31, but he may not have another year as monumental as this one. His role as the vicious Erik Killmonger in the Ryan Coogler blockbuster Black Panther, which has grossed a reported $1.34 billion to date, has brought the Newark, NJ-raised actor to a level of fame he never realized from his other films, Creed and Fruitvale Station among them.

These days, Jordan tells The Post, he cant walk down the street without attracting attention.

People used to stop me and just say, Whats up? he says. Now its grown  its crazy. Thats the big impact [Black Panther] has had on my life.

Now theres another role that may make passers-by look twice at Jordan: that of firefighter Guy Montag in the latest adaptation of Fahrenheit 451, premiering Saturday night on HBO.

Based on Ray Bradburys science-fiction classic, the movie presents a not-so-distant future in which mind control is enforced by a fire department that routinely destroys any cultural information it calls graffiti. In Bradburys 1953 novel, that meant books, but in this remake, the forbidden material includes films, paintings, sheet music and recordings.

Now theres another role that may make passers-by look twice at Jordan: that of firefighter Guy Montag in the latest adaptation of Fahrenheit 451, premiering Saturday night on HBO.

At HBOs New York headquarters, Jordan  the B, by the way, stands for Bakari  is dressed casually in gray trousers and a navy, short-sleeve polo shirt that gives his well-defined biceps plenty of breathing room. He says he was initially reluctant to play Montag, who experiences a crisis of conscience when he witnesses the self-immolation of a book lover whos strapped novels onto her body like a suicide bomber. Before leaving the scene of the conflagration, Montag swipes a copy of Dostoyevskys Notes From the Underground, and his own revolution is set in motion.

Montag being a fireman, burning books, art, information, passing judgment on people  I couldnt help but, as I was reading [the script], see brown and black faces, Jordan says. I didnt want to be an oppressor with what was going on in my community. The police brutality, the shootings and all that stuff. I didnt want to be seen as that.

Jordan says director Ramin Bahrani helped him see the story from another vantage point: as a portrayal of a world in which people have inadvertently given up their identities to tech companies and big business.

I wanted to be part of the narrative that helps change the habit of thought, Jordan says. Thats what I think true story-telling is about . . . I wanted to go against the grain.

It may seem that Jordan was an overnight success, thanks to Fruitvale Station. When that film came out in 2013, his performance as Oscar Grant, a police-shooting victim at an Oakland, Calif., BART station, drew raves.

But Jordan had been working up to that moment of recognition for years. Modeling as a child for Modells Sporting Goods and ToysRUs ads led to brief appearances on the first season of The Sopranos and on The Cosby Show. A stint on the ABC soap All My Children paved the way for a pivotal role as a young drug dealer on the first season of the HBO drama The Wire and, eventually, a regular role in the last two seasons of Friday Night Lights. His first feature film was 2001s Hardball with Keanu Reeves.

What Fruitvale made clear was that the camera loved him: Critics saw in Jordan the same movie-star charisma exuded by Denzel Washington. People always want to compare something to something, Jordan says modestly.

Recently, Jordan had the chance to sit down with Washington himself.

To talk to him and have the conversation we had was pretty awesome, he says of the actor, whos currently starring in The Iceman Cometh on Broadway. I just want to be the best version of myself. I just want to continue to grow and be the best actor I can be and evolve as I get older. I want to stand the test of time. Thats something hes done. If I can stick around half the time he did and continue to elevate my game, Ill be pleased.

For now, though, Broadway  Jordans dream  will have to wait.

I cant do it now, he says. Theres too much stuff going on. Jordan is already committed to filming Wrong Answer with his frequent collaborator Ryan Coogler, about a real-life Atlanta teacher who altered his students test scores to get more funding. And, lately, hes been in Philadelphia filming a sequel to the boxing drama Creed.

The actor, who lives in Sherman Oaks, Calif., with his parents, Michael A. and Donna, is happy to be back with Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson, his co-stars from the first Creed.

This is a little bigger than the first one, Jordan says of the sequel. That one didnt have a clear antagonist. We have an antagonist in this one. Like whom?

I think youll be pleasantly surprised, he says, and flashes a broad smile."
2018-04-12,New York Post,Toys R Us is having trouble selling its store locations,"Hundreds of Toys R Us stores will likely remain dark for a long time after they close for good on June 30.

As the massive liquidation of the storied retailer hits full swing, its becoming clear that real estate shoppers view its unattractive, boxy stores the same way toy customers did in recent years.

Thats hardly good news for the landlords of its 700-plus remaining locations in the US.

Of 140 stores that hit the auction block last week, just 50 received winning bids, and 30 of them were from the landlords themselves, some of whom scooped up their own properties for $5,000 to $10,000.

A Toys R Us landlord in West Hartford, Conn., got its store back for as little as $4,978, according to court papers.

In total, Toys R Us pulled in just over $37 million in the auction, comprised mostly of its least profitable stores.

The retailer has not set a schedule for when the rest of its stores will hit the block and some landlords are becoming impatient.

We have been gearing up for the past several weeks, said bankruptcy attorney David Pollack of Ballard Spahr, who represents 15 Toys R Us landlords.

Real estate experts say the low number of bids wasnt a total surprise given the glut of retail corpses.

There is a lot of inventory out there now, and in todays world and marketplace 50 bids on a 140 stores is a pretty good result, even if there was no interest in more than 100 stores, Pollack told The Post.

Among the successful bidders were a handful of retailers including Big Lots, Raymour & Flanigan, PGA Tour Superstore, Burlington Coat Factory and Farmers Fresh Market Place. The rest were real estate developers.

Raymour & Flanigan snatched the Babies R Us store in Union Square in Manhattan for a mere $250,000, as well as three other New York metro stores including the Paramus, NJ, Toys R Us store for $1.3 million, while Big Lots picked up two stores for $303,000.

The Union Square store had less than 10 years left on the lease, according to a source familiar with the property.

The biggest bid  $15.6 million for a San Francisco-area store that Toys R Us owned  was won by a New Jersey real estate developer, Benderson, while the second largest bid for another property Toys R Us owned in Chicago went for $7.5 million from shopping center developer Festival Development Corp.

The question is whether well see any sexy names like TJX, Best Buy, Whole Foods or Amazon bid on the rest of the stores, said one real estate expert who did not want to be identified.

Target and the German grocer Aldi were among the qualified bidders for last weeks auction, but neither pulled the trigger.

Separately, Toy R Us has had better luck trying to sell its operations abroad.

On Wednesday, it received multiple bids of more than $1 billion for an 85 percent stake in its Asian business, its lawyer Joshua Sussberg said, adding that the liquidation and real estate auctions were going better than expected, according to Reuters."
2018-10-08,New York Post,NYPD cop sues for 5M says she was shamed for pumping breast milk on the job,"An NYPD officer is suing Mayor de Blasio and the city for treating cop-mothers seeking time to pump breast milk as if they were slackers taking too many breaks.

In a legal notice filed with the city comptroller, Simone Teagle says her bosses at the 113th Precinct in Queens gave her so many problems about her requests to pump at work that she developed mastitis, a painful condition that arises when nursing mothers fail to express milk regularly.

Teagle, 37, says the city failed to provide her and other breast-feeding moms with a private and clean space to pump on the job, in violation of the law.

She says she was harassed for asserting her legal right to pump and transferred in retaliation.

Teagle seeks $5 million in a lawsuit to be filed in Brooklyn federal court, said her lawyer Eric Sanders.

The legislators decided its good public policy to protect the legal rights of nursing mothers in the workplace and we intend to hold the parties responsible for completely disregarding them, Sanders said.

In an interview with The Post, Teagle said the problems started shortly after she returned from maternity leave in January.

They would look at me and roll their eyes. Or cut their eyes at me like, Oh boy, here we go again. Sometimes they wouldnt even acknowledge me, she said.

The backlash was so bad she didnt even dare to complain about the dumpy conditions she was forced to pump in  including the womens bathroom, in her parked car and in a messy, moldy locker room, she said.

There was trash on the floor, mold on the walls, old newspapers, she told The Post.

It was just a deplorable situation to pump milk in. Just horrible.

She said her medical problems started in August, when a supervisor demanded she start logging her pump breaks where everyone could see them.

After a while I stopped asking for a break, she said. Only when I felt the need and my breasts were filling up. I didnt want to deal the faces and the nastiness.

I know there are other women who have dealt with the breast pump issue, she said about the NYPD. Most of them just totally stopped breastfeeding. They just stopped breastfeeding because they didnt want to deal with it."
2018-03-03,New York Post,Elton John tells overeager fan to fk off before leaving stage,"Elton John stormed off stage during his Thursday night show in Las Vegas.

In a video obtained by TMZ, the singer was performing Saturday Nights Alright for Fighting when a few of his fans who he had invited onstage became unruly.

In the video, John walks offstage mid-song when a fan kept trying to high-five him.

I saw him say f off to somebody, an audience member told the gossip site.

He eventually returned to the stage and declared, No more coming on stage on Saturday Night. You fed it up.

Just last month, fans threw Mardi Gras beads at John while he was singing the same song and a few of the beads whacked him in the face.

Shocked and clearly appalled, John was aided by security as he checked his teeth to make sure that there wasnt too much damage.

According to TMZ, the singer had invited the first row of audience members onto the stage for the song, and one of them was reportedly the bead-thrower.

But after only a few seconds, John composed himself and the show continued on.

John recently made headlines after announcing that he would officially retire from touring."
2018-07-05,New York Post,Lions fatally maul poachers who broke into reserve to hunt rhinos,"At least three poachers who broke into a rhinoceros reserve met a gruesome fate when they were mauled to death by a pride of lions, according to a report.

The hunters were torn to shreds by the big cats at the Sibuya Game Reserve in Kenton-on-Sea, South Africa, where staffers discovered bloodied body parts, including a head and limbs Tuesday, the Daily Express reported.

The lions are our watchers and guardians and they picked the wrong pride and became a meal, said Nick Fox, 60, who owns the reserve. Whilst we are saddened at any loss of life, the poachers came here to kill our animals and this sends out a very clear message to any other poachers that you will not always be the winner.

A helicopter was called in to search for more poachers but none were found.

We found enough body parts and three pairs of empty shoes which suggest to us that the lions ate at least three of them but it is thick bush and there could be more, Fox said.

Also recovered were hunting rifles and axes  proof that they were after the threatened species.

They were armed with high-powered rifles with silencers and an axe for the horns and wire cutters and side arms and they had enough food with them to last for many days, noted Fox. They were clearly intent on killing rhinos and cutting off their horns.

Police were working on determining exactly how many were killed and whether theyve struck before.

We do not know identities but firearms have been taken by the police and will be sent to the ballistics laboratory to see if they have been used in poaching before, said police spokeswoman Capt. Mali Govender.

Poachers have broken into the popular 30-square-mile reserve in the Eastern Cape before.

In 2016, three rhinos were killed when poachers sneaked into the park, shooting them and cutting off their horns.

Nine rhinos have been killed with high-caliber hunting rifles at Eastern Cape reserves so far this year."

2018-08-15,New York Post,Dan Marinos son arrested for DUI had slurred speech cops,"The son of Hall of Fame NFL quarterback Dan Marino was arrested for DUI last week in Florida with a blood alcohol content nearly three times the legal limit, police said.

Michael Marino, 30, was pulled over by police less than half a mile from his home in Fort Lauderdale at about 1:30 a.m. Friday after running a stop sign in his 2016 Ford SUV and causing two cars traveling west on Broward Boulevard to brake suddenly and hard to avoid a traffic crash, according to an arrest report obtained by the Miami Herald.

An officer immediately noticed Marino had bloodshot, glassy eyes and an odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his person and the interior of his SUV, according to the arrest report. Marinos speech was also slurred, and he was slow to react or respond to the responding officers commands.

Marino  who works as a professional DJ as DJ One Trey, a reference to his fathers uniform number for the Miami Dolphins and the University of Pittsburgh  then failed a field DUI test and refused to partake in additional screenings. He also initially refused a breath test that later measured his blood alcohol content at .209 and .210, or nearly three times the legal limit of .08, according to the arrest report.

Marino, who was diagnosed with autism in 1991, posted $1,500 bond on Friday and entered a not guilty plea Tuesday to driving under the influence and driving under the influence with a blood alcohol level higher than .15, the Miami Herald reports.

Marino is a member of the board of directors for the Dan Marino Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people with autism and other developmental disabilities. Marinos father, the former Dolphins star and Hall of Fame quarterback, launched the charitable group in 1992 with his wife, Claire, after their sons diagnosis, according to its website."

2018-07-07,New York Post,Kirsten Gillibrand had a better chance of being president 10 years ago,"The Democrats have an all-but-unbeatable potential presidential candidate lined up for 2020. Shes a woman who enjoys an A rating from the National Rifle Association and brags about going out to shoot the family turkey for Thanksgiving. She has spoken out in favor of federal fines for sanctuary cities, supported making English the national language, called for more border enforcement and opposed drivers licenses for illegal immigrants. She is a fiscal moderate and a proud face of rural America. Ohio? Pennsylvania? Wisconsin? Shed romp in all of them.

Unfortunately for her party, this woman no longer exists. She is Kirsten Gillibrand circa 2008, the days when she was a congresswoman representing New Yorks largely rural 20th district. The 2018 Gillibrand has renounced all of these stances, moving left and left and left again. She supports the New New Deal that is todays progressive economics (Medicare for all, a federal jobs guarantee, a $15 minimum wage) and says she couldnt have been more wrong about her previous support for gun rights. By 2010, her first full year in the Senate, the NRA had altered its rating of her record  to an F. A decade ago Gillibrand was a strong supporter of Israel; these days she is writing hymns of praise in Time magazine for the far-left anti-Semitic activist Linda Sarsour. She was the only senator to vote against confirming James Mattis as secretary of defense.

All of this now appears to be mere prelude to Gillibrands latest gambit: calling for extinguishing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That puts her in a 31 percent minority among registered voters, according to a poll that followed a surge in not-so-great publicity for ICE. If 31 percent is all the support you can muster for abolishing ICE at a moment when the public image of same is the child-caging agency, youd be better off arguing that the IRS should be put in charge of health care.

Abolishing ICE is an extreme position. Its shocking. Shocking and extreme positions stick to the political consciousness. When you begin a sentence with We should get rid of [ICE], no one is going to hear any words that follow, even if your proposed fix sounds a lot like ICE under another name. Moreover, Abolish ICE is becoming a rallying cry on the left, with one nutjob even shutting down the Statue of Liberty with the words on her lips. Once youre associated with Abolish ICE, its not going to be easy to slip away from it.

Gillibrand is branding herself the ICEbreaker because of the pre-primary scrambling to position herself as the most notable scourge of Trump among potential presidential candidates and hoping to generate media attention in proportion. By proudly becoming the first senator to support abolishing ICE  beating even Elizabeth Warren, who quickly agreed  she created consternation for other Democrats. Were they altogether on-board with the idea of destroying the agency tasked with dealing with illegal aliens?

The left is hoping the midterms will be a referendum on Trumps behavior. The self-promoting tendencies of Gillibrand and other Democrats venturing to extremes could make it a referendum on ICE instead.

Like Barack Obama before her, and like Warren and Bernie Sanders and their Senate colleague and potential rival presidential candidate Cory Booker, Gillibrand has blinders on. All she can see is the White House. She fails to notice how risky ICEbreaking is for the Democratic brand in other areas, such as the Senate races. Consider the plight of all those red- and purple-state Democratic senators coming up for re-election who now find themselves members of the ICE-eliminationist party. Heck, from his position sandwiched between Gillibrands and Warrens states, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut felt the need to reel in his colleagues and change the subject back to Donald J. Trump: Abolishing ICE will accomplish nothing unless we change the Trump policies, Blumenthal declared.

Thats nonsense: Trump policies dont mean a lot if they dont have anybody out there with guns and badges to enforce them. But Blumenthal was getting back to the message, which is Vote Democratic, not Open the Floodgates. Blumenthal, unlike Gillibrand, seems aware of such developments as a) the upward drift of Trump support (an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll released July 3 had him at 48 percent) and b) the hints that a desire for immigration enforcement could motivate GOP voters to get to the polls. Imagine being Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp this fall and facing voters who are being given excellent reason to think the Democrats want to replace the Border Patrol with a Welcome yall sign.

The left is hoping the midterms will be a referendum on Trumps behavior. The self-promoting tendencies of Gillibrand and other Democrats venturing to extremes could make it a referendum on ICE instead. The harder they push on issues to galvanize the base and presidential-primary voters, the more difficult they are making it for any one of them actually to get elected president or to win the House and Senate seats a Democratic president would need to advance any legislation. The race to be most radical is a self-defeating strategy."

2018-09-02,New York Post,Gloria Govan arrested for alleged child endangerment,"Basketball Wives star Gloria Govan has been arrested and charged with felony child endangerment, according to reports.

Govan reportedly became involved in an altercation Friday with her ex-husband, retired NBA player Matt Barnes.

According to TMZ, Barnes was scheduled to pick up the couples 9-year-old twin boys from school on Friday afternoon, per the couples child-custody agreement, but Govan showed up at the school early and picked up the children instead.

TMZ said sources told the outlet that when Barnes arrived, he instructed the kids to get out of Govans vehicle and into his. The children then complied, reportedly sending Govan into a fit of rage.

According to TMZ, Govan drove after Barnes car and at one point was able to block it  prompting someone to call 911.

When police arrived, they arrested Govan and allowed Barnes to take the children when he produced paperwork related to the custody agreement.

Govan was released Saturday on $100,000 bail, the report said.

Later, Govan posted a message on Instagram, saying in part:

Let me tell yall something... there isnt a person on this earth that isnt struggling with something! I dont care how much money, success, or followers anyone has. We all have problems. Youre not alone. Trust me.

Barnes, 38, played college basketball at UCLA then went on to a pro career with multiple NBA teams from 2004 to 2017.

Since divorcing Barnes, Govan, 33, has reportedly entered a relationship with former NBA player and coach Derek Fisher.

2018-07-14,New York Post,FDA approves first drug to treat smallpox in case of terror attack,"US regulators Friday approved the first treatment for smallpox  a deadly disease that was wiped out four decades ago  in case the virus is used in a terror attack.

Smallpox, which is highly contagious, was eradicated worldwide by 1980 after a huge vaccination campaign.

But people born since then havent been vaccinated, and small samples of the smallpox virus were saved for research purposes, leaving the possibility it could be used as a biological weapon.

Maker SIGA Technologies of New York has already delivered 2 million treatments that will be stockpiled by the government, which partially paid for the development of the drug, called TPOXX.

To test the drugs effectiveness, monkeys and rabbits were infected with a similar virus and then given the drug. More than 90 percent survived, the company said. Its safety was tested in several hundred healthy volunteers, who were not infected with smallpox.

Smallpox killed about 300 million people worldwide in the 20th century before its eradication. Symptoms include fever, fatigue and pus-filled sores. Until now, doctors could only provide supportive care such as IV fluids and fever remedies and isolate the patients. Vaccination can be used to prevent infection but it must be done within five days of exposure to the virus, well before symptoms appear.

This new treatment affords us an additional option should smallpox ever be used as a bioweapon, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, head of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement.

The drug is a capsule, taken twice daily for 14 days.

SIGA develops vaccines and medicines for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear attacks. Chief Executive Phil Gomez said the company is developing an IV version and is exploring selling the drug to other countries and developing it to treat other infectious diseases, including monkeypox, which African monkeys can transmit to humans. Monkeypox can then spread among people, and has a mortality rate of about 15 percent."
2018-02-28,New York Post,The saline used in IV bags could be killing you,"New research calls into question whats in those IV bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets. Using a different intravenous fluid instead of the usual saline greatly reduced the risk of death or kidney damage, two large studies found.

The difference could mean 50,000 to 70,000 fewer deaths and 100,000 fewer cases of kidney failure each year in the U.S., researchers estimate. Some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch.

Weve been sounding the alarm for 20 years about possible harms from saline, said Dr. John Kellum, a critical care specialist at the University of Pittsburgh. Its purely inertia that prevents a change, he said.

Kellum had no role in the studies, which were discussed Tuesday at a critical care conference in San Antonio and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Federal grants helped pay for the work.

IVs are one of the most common things in health care. They are used to prevent dehydration, maintain blood pressure or give patients medicines or nutrients if they cant eat.

Saline  salt dissolved in water  has been the most widely used fluid in the U.S. for more than a century even as evidence has emerged that it can harm kidneys, especially when used a lot.

Other IV solutions called balanced fluids include saline but also contain potassium and other things that make them more like plasma, the clear part of blood. Theyre widely used in Europe and Australia.

The studies involved 28,000 patients at Vanderbilt University who were given IVs of saline or a balanced fluid. For every 100 people on balanced fluids, there was one fewer death or severe kidney problem.

Since there are about 30 million people hospitalized in the U.S. alone each year, there are tens or hundreds of thousands of patients who would be spared death or severe kidney problems by using balanced fluids instead of saline, said one study leader, Vanderbilts Dr. Matthew Semler.

After seeing the results two months ago, Vanderbilt hospital officials decided to primarily use balanced fluids. The University of Pittsburgh also has largely switched to them, Kellum said.

The fluids cost about the same  a dollar or two per IV  and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.

IV fluids have been in the news since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last fall, shutting down electricity to three plants owned by Baxter International, one of the biggest makers of these fluids. The shortage has eased, but some supply issues remain."
2018-03-28,New York Post,Fifth-grade teacher charged in gang killings of two kids,"A fifth-grade teacher in Georgia is accused of killing teen siblings in a gang-related home invasion.

Michael DeSean White, 26, was taken away in handcuffs from DeKalbs Toney Elementary School Friday in connection with the 2016 killing, Clayton County Sheriffs Office spokeswoman Sgt. Ashanti Marbury said.

Police said Tatiyana Coates, 11, and her brother Daveon Coates, 15, were asleep in their home on Oct. 22, 2016 when they were shot to death by gang members looking for a different teen, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.

Another 15-year-old had been staying in the home briefly after the Coates took his family in  but wasnt home when the gang broke in. He was taken into protective custody in Tennessee immediately after the home invasion.

Four younger children  ages 6 to 13  were also in the home during the attack and were not hurt.

Cops charged the teacher with four counts of murder and said he was possibly one of many perps. Investigators didnt confirm whether White was actually the triggerman or whether he was part of the gang.

A sketch of a man seen at the murder scene by a witness helped police identify White.

It kicks you in the gut that someone whos responsible for our children on a daily basis could possibly be involved in a heinous crime like this, Maj. Tina Daniel told WSB-TV.

White wont be back in the classroom until the investigation is complete, district officials told the outlet. He began working as a teachers assistant in March 2017 and became a fifth-grade teacher in August.

He remains in custody at the Clayton County Jail without bail.

The Coates siblings are among the victims of a deadly string of gun violence against kids in the county. From Oct. to Dec. 2016, seven people between the ages of 11 and 18 were killed and their alleged killers were also young people."
2018-05-07,New York Post,Nestle pays 72 billion for rights to sell Starbucks coffee,"Swiss-based food giant Nestle will pay Starbucks $7.15 billion in cash for the rights to sell the US coffee chains products around the world, tying a premium brand to Nestles global distribution muscle.

The deal on Monday for a business with $2 billion in sales reinforces Nestles position as the worlds biggest coffee company tries to fortify its place atop a fast-changing market.

It is a bold stroke by new Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who has made coffee a strategic priority as he tries to convince uneasy shareholders, including activist Third Point, that he can boost the sprawling groups performance.

Nestle shares rose 1.4 percent by mid-session, having fallen by more than 8 percent so far this year. Starbucks stock was indicated 2.8 percent higher.

Seattle-based Starbucks, the worlds biggest coffee chain, said it will use proceeds to speed share buybacks and the deal would add to earnings per share by 2021 at the latest.

Nestle said it expects the deal to sell Starbucks bagged coffee and drinks adding to earnings by 2019. It will not involve any of Starbucks cafes or ready-to-drink products.

But it does let Nestle sell Starbucks coffee in individual pods  as it does now with Nespresso and Nescafe  and expand sales of Starbucks soluble coffee, a key market in Asia. Starbucks now sells single-serve coffee in Kuerig K-cup pods.

The Nestle name will not appear on Starbucks products. We do not want the consumer to perceive that Starbucks is now part of a bigger family, a Nestle source said.

Starbucks, strong mostly in the United States, will have the final say on expanding its product range.

Nestle and Starbucks are joining forces in a highly fragmented consumer drinks category that has seen a string of deals lately.

JAB Holdings, the private investment firm of Europes billionaire Reimann family, has fueled the consolidation wave with a series of deals including Douwe Egberts, Peets Coffee & Tea and Keurig Green Mountain, narrowing the gap with Nestle.

Coffee is popular with younger customers who have grown up with Starbucks. A willingness to pay up for exotic beans and specialty drinks means companies can brew up richer profit margins than in mainstream packaged food.

In the US, Nescafe is seen as a downscale brand for older people, and the Nespresso system as a niche product. Starbucks is the quality, mass-market leader, said Erik Gordon at the Univesity of Michigans Ross School of Business.

Starbucks, which in April reported a global drop in quarterly traffic to its established cafes, has been revamping its business amid competition in its key home market. It sold its Tazo tea brand to Unilever for $384 million and closed underperforming Teavana retail stores.

Starbucks is rapidly expanding in China, which it expects to one day be its largest market. It also plans to open 1,000 upscale Starbucks Reserve stores and a handful of Roastery coffee emporiums to take on high-end coffee rivals such as Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea and Blue Bottle.

Starbucks has long farmed out the retail distribution of its packaged products to a company more specialized in that process, but the partnerships have not always been smooth.

Nestle, the worlds largest packaged food company, is also not shy when it comes to partnering with rivals through licensing deals or joint ventures, having reached arrangements with General Mills and Hershey, among others."

2018-07-31,New York Post,Raging California wildfires threaten nearly 10K more homes,"LAKEPORT, Calif.  Twin wildfires tearing through vineyards and brushy hills threatened some 10,000 homes in Northern California Tuesday  yet another front in the seemingly endless summer of wildfires that have ravaged some of the most scenic areas of the state.

The two fires straddling Mendocino and Lake counties had burned seven homes by Monday night along with some 107 square miles of rural land.

About 100 miles north, the so-called Carr Fire that has burned more than 800 homes and killed six people has become the ninth most destructive wildfire in California history, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

In Lake County, evacuation orders were in effect for the 4,700-resident town of Lakeport along with some smaller communities and a section of Mendocino National Forest. In all, some 10,000 people have been warned to flee, fire officials said.

Lakeport, north of San Francisco, is the county seat and a popular destination for bass anglers and boaters on the shores of Clear Lake. But by Monday night it was a ghost town, the main streets deserted.

A few miles away embers, ash and smoke swirled through vineyards where at least one home had gone up in flames. Firefighters set blazes at the bottom of hills in order to burn up the tinder-dry brush before flames cresting the ridge tops could feed on it and surge downhill. A fleet of aircraft made continuous water and fire retardant drops on the blaze, filling the air with the roar of their engines.

But not everyone heeded orders issued Sunday and Monday to evacuate.

Derick Hughes II remained behind at his property in Nice, California, where he ran sprinklers on his roof and removed yard plants that could catch fire.

The 32-year-old Marine Corps veteran sent his wife and two daughters to safety along with three carloads of belongings. But he said he had too much at stake to leave himself. He bought his three-bedroom house last year using a loan from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

This is everything I bled for, and Ive worked really hard to get to where I am, and Im just not willing to give it up so easily, he said over the phone. Some people may think thats selfish of me, and I have insurance. But the way things go, Id rather not start over.

Farther north, police said five people were arrested on suspicion of entering areas evacuated due to the explosive wildfire around Redding.

The blaze, which killed two firefighters and four civilians including two children, has now destroyed 818 homes and 311 outbuildings and damaged 165 homes, McLean said.

More than 27,000 people remained evacuated from their homes although another 10,000 were allowed to return Monday as fire crews reinforced lines on the western end of Carr Fire.

Some 12,000 firefighters were battling the blaze. Fire officials were hopeful that they could make progress containing the blaze, which was 23 percent contained.

The fires northwestern corner continued to be active.

Its still putting up a fight, McLean said.

Those fires were among 17 burning across the state, where fire crews were stretched to the limit.

In Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, an arson fire that destroyed seven homes last week was 82 percent contained Monday.

Fire crews also have battled numerous small brushfires this summer, most charring only a few acres but still threatening homes in built-up areas along parched foothills. A 10-acre fire damaged 13 homes and apartments Monday in Santa Clarita, northwest of Los Angeles, county fire officials said.

McLean, the state fire spokesman, said there was no guarantee of safety in a state that has been ravaged by years of drought that has turned trees and brush to tinder.

Anything could happen anywhere. Thats the nature of the beast for all of these fires, he said. The vegetation is so dry all it takes is a spark to get it going."
2018-11-25,New York Post,What you can do when a company wont honor a warranty,"Dear John: We bought an Electrolux washer and dryer.

The Electrolux warranty service guy, on his second visit, basically said, Thats the way its designed ... uh ... sorry. He also told us there was nothing he could do, no fix

Dear A.J. It seems to me there is only one solution. Get rid of your wife; keep the machines.

Oh, no! That would be wrong and would probably cost you more in the long run.

Let me try again.

I contacted Electrolux, and the company said your machines have been tested twice and the appliance is operating as designed and intended. If a consumer believes that their product is not working as expected, we urge them to contact our consumer services group to discuss whether service is necessary.

In other words, dont call the media, its really annoying to a consumer products firm.

You told me, summarizing Electroluxs attitude: Bottom line, Electrolux has more favorable than unfavorable surveys, and the machine is doing what it is designed to do.

As far as the company is concerned, I should just ignore how it works (or not), ignore the knocking ... and oh yeah! Go seek relief from the retailer!

I guess that I have too small a profile on social media. Small Claims Court? Thanks for your time.

Heres the thing. The only way Ill know if the machine is working is if you do my laundry. But that seems a bit excessive.

So I have to take your word that you got a lemon. And all the people reading this will wonder if they buy from Electrolux theyll end up getting lemoned too.

You ask about Small Claims Court. My only experience with that is in New York City, and it was great.

What you need to know is this little secret: A company must hire lawyers for Small Claims Court, and you dont. So I wonder how long it will be before Electrolux spends more for a lawyer than to fix your machine and end your gripe.

And if you do go to court over this, remember to ask for a lot of continuances. That lawyer is counting on you to make him rich.

Dear John: Your column about federal spending was right on.

I have been following federal spending, deficits and debt for many decades. Where you and I part is that I believe all this excessive federal spending, deficits and debt is the result of the Federal Reserve.

Central banks finance all this and make big government possible. They finance with their printing press.

Governments love central banks, thats why they exist. Its not only our kids and grandkids that will pay. Interest payments fall partly to future generations, but the initial cost is paid by those in the present. H.B.

And certainly during the Great Recession it was the Fed that pumped money like crazy to get the economy going and to appease Wall Street.

That extra money  in the form of the Feds Quantitative Easing policies  was only expected to influence interest rates and not leach into the real economy.

But, of course, it did. And with rates very low, Washington could borrow more and more. And it did, which of course led to the current state of our deficit.

Now rates are going up and the government has to refinance at higher rates and without the help of the Fed. So the deficit and debt will rise again."

2018-07-19,New York Post,Shawn Mendes congratulated Hailey Baldwin on engagement via text,"Shawn Mendes sent well wishes to rumored ex Hailey Baldwin via text following her engagement to Justin Bieber.

I texted Hailey the day of, and I said congrats the pop star said recently on Australias The Project. Thats what it is. I think everybody wants there to be more, theres not.

Baldwin, 21, and Mendes, 19, were first linked last fall before attending the annual Met Gala together this spring. The Nothing Holding Me Back crooner later denied the two were an item.

Obviously Hailey and I are friends, and it was just really cool for me to be able to walk with her because shes a vet and it was my first year, so it kind of took the pressure off a little bit, Mendes told People in May.

The model later reconnected with former flame Bieber, 24, in June. The Friends singer proposed to Baldwin earlier this month while vacationing at a luxury resort in the Bahamas. Bieber confirmed the news on Instagram, gushing over fiancee.

2018-07-12,New York Post,Icelandic hunters accused of slaughtering endangered whale,"Icelandic hunters have been accused of harpooning an endangered blue whale in the first such killing in 50 years.

Harrowing photos showed fisherman from the Hvalur firm dragging the gigantic mammal into a dock on Saturday.

Hvalur has a license to catch fin whales, which are more common and claimed the captured beast is a hybrid of the two species.

Marine conservation group Hard To Port said they had been tracking the whale until it was killed on the night of July 7.

It claimed the animal showed all the features of a blue whale, including a darker belly and bluish color.

If these fears are confirmed, it would be the first official blue whale to be harpooned in half a century.

Blue whales have been a protected species since 1966 and less than 25,000 are left in the worlds oceans.

Dr. Phillip Clapham of the Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle studied images of the whale caught by Hvalur. He told the Sydney Morning Herald the whale did not have any characteristics to suggest it was a hybrid.

Clapham added: It has all the characteristics of a blue whale, notably the coloration pattern. There is almost no possibility that an experienced observer would have misidentified it as anything else at sea.

The blue whale, weighing more than 150 tons and measuring as much as 100-feet long, have become very rare.

There were once more than 250,000 in existence but their size and blubber made them a popular target for whalers.

They used their body parts to make lucrative products including perfume, cooking oil, soap, candles and even umbrellas.

With the creating of new and deadly fishing technology, the whaling industry exploded in the 1700s, according to Whale Facts.

In 1986, several countries signed up to an agreement drawn up by the International Whaling Commission to stop all whaling activities.

Kristjan Loftsson, the managing director of Hvalur, said he was certain it was not a blue whale.

He also said it would be impossible for his crews to tell the difference between fin whales and hybrids in the water.

Nicole Beynon of Humane Society International Australia said: Killing a blue whale is unforgivable.

This should be a final wake-up call to Iceland that commercial whaling does not belong in the 21st century."
2018-10-24,New York Post,Sea lion rounded up in San Diego after blocking traffic,"Police found the mammal getting in the way of traffic when they responded in Point Loma on Monday afternoon, according to multiple reports.

The creatures big day out didnt last forever: the animal was rounded up on Garrison Street by SeaWorld San Diego workers, according to David Koontz, the communications director for SeaWorld San Diego.

She didnt resist [during the rescue], Koontz told Fox News. They were able to get the rescue nets on her pretty quickly.

Shes resting right now in our animal rescue center, Koontz said of the 175-pound creature, which he described as being in good-bodied condition.

Koontz said the sea lion is alert and active and chowed down on some live fish in her pool  which, he said, were good signs.

We want to monitor her for several days, he said. If we determine we need to do an additional examination, the park will go from there.

If she does well, the park will release her into the ocean, according to Koontz.

San Diego police did not immediately respond to Fox News request for comment."

Martin, 41, performed his hit Clocks in Spanish to a salsa beat, as well as a few covers. While his 50 Shades beauty Dakota, 28, was not in the crowd, her dad was bopping along before being called onstage, as Jamie Foxx called him the most handsome man in the world.

Martins been dating Dakota since 2017. Last month, they were seen cuddling in Boston on a double date with Aaron Paul and his wife. In January, Don said: Hes a lovely guy. Ive met him, and you want your kids happy ... Hes a very talented and gifted musician.

A source said, Chris is friends with Pharrell, the events creative director, and [the surprise] is something they worked up.

Chaka Khan brought down the house with a string of hits for guests, including Robert Downey Jr., Jimmy Fallon, Zach Braff, Jimmy Buffett and Molly Sims. Sting, who flew in from Italy and then straight back, performed as well as Shaggy, Jon Bon Jovi, and the Roots.

Former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and husband Mark Kelly were also at the bash, held at the home of billionaire Ron Perelman in East Hampton. Perelman missed the event due to a bacterial infection and was taken to Weill Cornell Hospital. He went home Sunday.

2018-08-11,New York Post,RHOBH stars Dorit Kemsley and PK sued over swimwear line,"Dorit Kemsleys new swimwear line may not be so beachy after all.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star and her husband Paul PK Kemsley are being sued for over $200,000 by their business partner Ryan Horne, per Los Angeles Court documents obtained by Page Six.

Horne claimed in his filing that the trio orally agreed to work together in August 2017, with his company paying for advances on the line and the Kemsleys reimbursing him. He also alleged that they agreed to share the profits, and they established Beverly Beach in May 2018.

Horne claimed that he sent the couple goods worth $129,052.51 and advanced costs worth $75,000  but he never received a dime back.

He also claimed that the company is now worth $300,000, and the Kemsleys kept the money for themselves. Horne wants his money back and the revenue he says hes owed.

A source close to the couple told us that Horne is a manufacturer who let everyone down with false promises and did not have the capacity to do what he said he would do. He has sort to extort the Kemsleys with the threat of publicity and a fabricated lawsuit which now sits in the realms of fantasy. He did not advance any money nor did he invest in the business. His behavior towards Dorit and her team was unacceptable and his actions have caused the business a lot of damage. Any lawsuit will be vigorously defended and countered."

2018-06-11,New York Post,Joe Bidens niece nearly in the clear over credit card scam,"Former vice president Joe Bidens niece  who used a stolen credit card to rack up over $100,000 in goods at a Greenwich Village pharmacy  is nearly in the clear.

Caroline Biden, 31, had her felony conviction tossed Monday and was allowed to re-plead to the lesser charge of petit larceny as part of a sweetheart deal she took in 2017. 

But the privileged Georgetown grad, who lives in California, will have to return to New York July 26 to wrap up her case. Justice Curtis Farber couldnt hand down the promised sentence of two years probation due to a paperwork snafu.

She already completed 10 days of court-ordered community service and paid full restitution of $110,810.04 for the charges she made at Bigelow Pharmacy, where a hairbrush and skin creams can run hundreds of dollars.

Biden, wearing a black skirt suit, looked disappointed as she strutted out of Manhattan Supreme Court with a pal.

In 2017, Biden was arrested for using the unidentified victims Chase card for a year-long shopping spree at the posh pharmacy. The victim had given her permission to make a single purchase totaling $672 in 2015, according to prosecutors.

The pampered wild child made her debut in Manhattan Criminal Court in 2014 after a dustup with her Tribeca roommate over unpaid rent.

She was accused of trying to slug a responding female cop and got booked on charges of resisting arrest and obstruction.

That case also got a wrist slap with the charges getting dismissed and sealed after six months.

Biden  whose financier dad, James Biden Sr., is the brother of the former vice president  has struggled with alcohol and drug addiction, according to published reports."
2018-06-13,New York Post,Why you should exercise when youre sick,"When it comes to exercise and immunity, we know that regular exercise at a moderate pace can boost immunity and keep the winter bugs at bay. Now, new research questions the wide spread belief that strenuous exercise (think marathons) can actually increase susceptibility to infections due to immune system depression.

A recent review published in the Journal Frontiers in Immunology looked to clarify common misconceptions regarding the relationship between exercise and the immune system that have formed over the years.

In their study, the authors explain that for many years weve understood immune cells change in two ways following exercise. First, the number of natural killer immune cells (which deal with infection) increase immediately. The new research has proved this to be the case.

What the research has now disproved though is the belief these natural killer cells decline dramatically in the hours and days post-exercise.

Until now, this open window theory gave us the understanding that our immune system would be compromised as our body recovers post workout  and we could be more susceptible to infection during this time.

But the new research has blown away this theory.

In fact, evidence now suggests that your immune system remains boosted after exercise  for example we know that exercise can improve your immune response to a flu jab, says study co-author, Dr James Turner.

The researchers believe that the cells are not destroyed (as previously thought), instead the cells migrate to other parts of the body, looking for other infections, such as the lower respiratory tract (chest or lungs), representing an immune boost, making it less likely for infections to flourish.

Given the important role exercise has for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes, the findings from our analysis emphasize that people should not be put off exercise for fear that it will dampen their immune system.

However, that doesnt mean youll never catch a cold again if youre an avid gym goer. The studys authors cautioned that a poor diet, getting cold and wet and psychological stress were linked to an increased risk of developing infections.

They also added that visiting public places with large gatherings of people, public transport, particularly airline travel over long distances, where sleep is compromised, might also increase infection risk.

Its also important to note that while a brisk walk or strenuous workout is not going to dampen your immunity, excessive exercise might. Too much exercise can make you overtired and not as resilient. Problem is, if you dont take time for proper R&R  a problem likely to be exacerbated if you dont get enough sleep every night  can run you down.

Youve got a few sniffles

 If youre sneezing a bit but otherwise feeling well, you dont need to starve a cold of exercise. Keep up your workout but maybe reduce the intensity a bit. Instead of your usual run, take a walk, do a little stretching, but dont use it as an excuse to throw in the fitness towel.

Youve got a fever

 Now is the time to listen to your body and rest. The function of a fever is to kill off most bacteria and viruses and throwing exercise into the mix can further elevate your internal temperature, making you even sicker. Intervals to the kitchens for cups of tea and Netflix marathons are highly recommended at this point.

Influenza or stomach flu

 Its important to avoid the virus spreading, so when you have widespread fatigue, muscles and joint aches or gastroenteritis, stay inside. As youre recovering, its fine to start exercising again  but ease back into it gradually. Avoid pushing yourself too hard too soon to make up for lost time.

Of course, the best case scenario would be  avoid getting sick in the first place. It helps to:"

2018-03-01,New York Post,Americans are ditching plastic surgery but are still super vain,"People are choosing the needle instead of going under the knife.

Since 2000, the number of cosmetic plastic surgery procedures has dropped 6 percent. But its not that weve become less concerned with our looks: In fact, people are simply opting for non-surgical alternatives like injectable fillers and Botox to reduce forehead lines, crows feet and wrinkles, according to data released Thursday by The American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

The number of people choosing minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures has increased a whopping 200 percent since 2000. Since then, the number of facelifts has gone down by 6 percent; nose jobs are down 44 percent; cheek implants are down 37 percent and forehead lifts decreased by 67 percent.

There seems to be a small decline in the surgical procedures and an uptick in the minimally invasive because were in a day in age where everyone is interested in what they can do with minimal downtime and good results, Dr. Jeffrey Janis, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, tells Moneyish.

Botox is the No. 1 minimally-invasive procedure with 7.2 million people getting the wrinkle reducing injections. Thats up 2 percent since last year, and 819 percent since 2000. At No. 2 on the list is soft tissue fillers for areas such as cheeks and lips, followed by chemical peels, laser hair removal, and microdermabrasion for smoother skin.

On its face, thats decent news for our pocketbooks: While the average cost of a facelift is $7,048, according to 2016 statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, fillers cost between $500 to $1,000 depending on how much work youd like to be done. However, you typically have to do fillers much more frequently.

Whats more, people are choosing to shape different parts of their bodies with non-surgical treatments, rather than liposuction. Non-surgical cellulite treatments that tighten skin  using ultrasound, radio frequency, infrared light, vacuum massage and injectable medication to reduce fat cells  are up nearly 20 percent since last year. And non-invasive fat-reduction procedures that use special technology to freeze away fat without surgery increased 7 percent, while skin tightening procedures that target fat and tighten sagging areas increased 9 percent. The cost of liposuction ranges from $2,000 to $3,500 per treatment region, not including the cost of anesthesia and other fees, while fat freezing costs typically start at around $750. Fat freezing alternatives and lipo can last a number of years, but without diet and exercise, results of both wear off eventually.

Unwanted fat is something that affects so many Americans, said Janis. Plastic surgeons are able to give patients more options than ever before for fat elimination or redistribution. Patients appreciate having options, especially if they can act as maintenance steps while they decide if getting something more extensive down the line will be right for them.

Of the surgical procedures, breast augmentations were most popular, followed by liposuction, nose jobs, eyelid surgery and tummy tucks. And one surgical procedure that is falling flat, according to Janis, is buttock implants, with a decline of 56 percent since last year."

When it opens this summer, the store will have three levels with 1,870 square feet on the ground, 1,134 square feet on the mezzanine and another 374 square feet on a lower level.

Matthew Seigel and Payal Doshi of Thor Retail Advisors represented the tenant in the 10-year lease.

We were thrilled to select 555 Fifth Avenue as the home for LOccitanes next New York concept store, Seigel said. The global community is of the utmost importance to LOccitane, and we felt that there was no better place than Fifth Avenue to continue to express that.

With respect to the site selection, we felt that 555 Fifth Avenue was unique in offering prominent visibility and frontage but also an appropriate store size to preserve their boutique brand DNA, Seigel added.

Andrew Mandell, Richard Skulnik and Lindsay Zegans of Ripco Real Estate represented building owner Atco Properties, which had an asking rent of $1,100 per square foot.

Taking to Instagram, the Dancing with the Stars pro revealed she recently met her long-lost sister, months after her fathers passing.

With my fathers passing came a lot of darkness but there was a lot of light  I found my sister who I had never known, she wrote Monday. We recently met for the first time and it was such a surreal experience to walk into a room to meet and walk out feeling like we had known each other forever.

2018-06-12,New York Post,Man miraculously survives brutal toll booth car crash,"A sleepy driver slammed into a toll plaza in central Florida earlier this month, sending a passenger flying into the air in a moment captured on surveillance video.

The Florida Highway Patrol on Monday released video of the fiery Osceola County crash, which took place around 7:15 a.m. June 3 near St. Cloud, south of Orlando.

The speeding car is seen in video striking a barrier in front of a toll lane, sending a man flying out of the vehicle.

The man lands in another toll lane near where a driver in another car was paying a toll.

State troopers told FOX13 they believe the driver, Steven Dos Santos, 23, was asleep or fatigued at the time of the crash. There were five people in the car at the time of the crash, according to police.

Getting behind the wheel while fatigued can have dangerous, and sometimes deadly, consequences, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles said on Twitter. If youre having difficulty focusing, frequent blinking or heavy eyelids, pull over in a safe place to rest before continuing to drive.

The passenger who was ejected from the vehicle miraculously survived the crash, and one of the other passengers was transported to the hospital with injuries. Amazingly, police said everyone survived the fiery wreck."
2018-10-10,New York Post,YouTuber ripped for trying to talk to the spirit of Mac Miller,"This YouTubers take on ghost hunting could haunt him.

YouTuber ImJayStation, whose real name is Jason Ethier, has caught flak for trying to communicate with the spirit of Mac Miller days after the 26-year-old rappers suicide.

The video begins with Ethier asking viewers to give the clip a thumbs up as a prayer for Mac Miller. He then pulls out an EVP  or electronic voice phenomenon  device which he claims scans the AM, FM radio waves at a really high pace to allow the alleged spirit of Miller to talk with him.

Ethier starts his EVP device and begins to caption supposed muffled dialogue he hears from a speaker. He attempts to question the radio static, at one point asking, Were you sad about Ariana Grande?

Ethier continues to question the noise coming from the speaker asking about the reasons behind Millers suicide. Later in the video, he claims a faint voice belonging to Miller allegedly told him that he made a mistake and not to worry because he was OK. Ethiers purported connection with the spirit realm comes to a close when a Grande video comes on a nearby TV and the EVP device turns off.

The 14-minute video has been widely criticized because Ethier enabled ads on the video to make money off the late rappers suicide. Viewers flooded the comments section of the video with negative remarks.

You are so sick, why would you even do that, another replied. You should be ashamed.

Ethier dismissed the criticism in an interview with the Daily Dot.

Everyone gains attention from [celebrity] death, by talking about it, he said.

No I wont do another celebrity who dies, even though if I did an EVP or ouija board video on Michael Jackson, Elvis, the Beatles, etc., people wouldnt care if I did that, Ethier told the Daily Dot."
2018-11-21,New York Post,How bettors can use NIT Tip Off to assess Big Dance potential,"Wednesday nights NIT Tip Off semifinal showdowns at Barclays Center are a reminder of the great college basketball connectivity handicappers can use to their advantage.

Those matchups (ESPN2, 5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.) are No. 5 Tennessee of the SEC versus Louisville of the ACC, and No. 2 Kansas of the Big 12 versus Marquette of the Big East.

All four combatants are very likely to matter in their conferences and the postseason. Current computer ratings suggest Kansas is Final Four material in the NCAA Tournament, Tennessee is Sweet 16 or Elite Eight quality (slightly less optimistic than the current AP poll), Marquette has Round of 32 potential, and Louisville will at least be in the discussion for a bid even if the program has been trending in the wrong direction.

Neutral-court showcases are ideal for evaluating tournament potential. This holiday week features several TV tourneys designed to promote power schools and power leagues. Youve probably been watching Duke in the Maui Invitational on TV since Monday. Maybe you went out to watch the Legends Classic in person at Barclays on Monday and Tuesday (St. Johns, California, Temple, and VCU).

As we noted this past weekend, college football doesnt have much in-season connectivity involving top contenders. So theres still some uncertainty even now in the final stages of the season how various powers might match up. Would one-loss Georgia or Oklahoma be favored over undefeated Notre Dame? Is Alabama a field goal better than Clemson, or a touchdown?

Sharp bettors can take advantage of what college basketball is offering, even when they dont bet. Here are some questions to ponder as you scout Wednesdays twinbill, and then Fridays final round (also on ESPN2) where Wednesdays winners and losers pair off:

Enjoy the Tip Off tourney. As you watch, think about how the market is currently perceiving these teams based on game-day point spreads ... and how you would rate these teams on the eye test.

2018-10-11,New York Post,The hottest real estate trends in NYC right now,"New Yorkers on the prowl for a new home this fall have plenty of options to consider, thanks to a number of rental and condo developments that have recently launched (or soon will).

But pounding the pavement can be time-consuming, not to mention exhausting. So, The Post gathered five prominent trends that define this latest wave of home-building.

Whether youre looking for a place with prime river views or a pad designed by famous local architects  heck, if you even want to know what borough has all the new-construction action  read on for our findings.

A handful of new buildings marks NYC debuts for the firms involved in their development and design. The Amberly at 120 Nassau St. in Downtown Brooklyn, where leasing recently launched (studios from $2,100), is the first North American tower from Australia-founded architecture firm Woods Bagot.

The development includes 1.5 acres of public waterfront space, as well as a bar with a terrace (contact: Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, 718-395-4782).

New York is a concrete jungle, so its residents need breaks from the hectic crush. Now, a number of new projects feature standout green spaces where residents can take in a bit of nature before heading back into reality. One of them, Tishman Speyers September-launched condo 11 Hoyt in Downtown Brooklyn, boasts a nearly 27,000-square-foot private park perched above street level (studios from the $600,000s).

Dunkin said Wednesday that the polystyrene foam cups will be completely phased out from its stores globally by 2020.

Because foam packaging decomposes slowly, ends up in oceans and can harm marine life and other animals that ingest it, there has been a push to ban its use.

2018-07-22,New York Post,Man called in bomb threat so he wouldnt miss flight,"An Ohio man who called in a bomb threat to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport so he would avoid missing his flight was sentenced Thursday to four months in prison and ordered to pay a fine.

Dana Carter of Dayton made a series of calls to the airport claiming there was a bomb on a Dallas, Texas-bound United Airlines flight in October.

The 40-year-old allegedly made the false reports because he was worried he was going to miss his flight.

The original flight ended up being canceled because of the threat and Carter was placed on another flight for Dallas less than two hours later, the Dayton Daily News reported.

Carters attorney admitted the false threat was a foolish act, the Daily News reported.

In addition to jail-time, Carter has been ordered to pay $7,700 in restitution to United Airlines for the canceled flight.

After his release, Carter will be on federal probation for three years."

The victims mom, Ashley Lyons, said the horrifying attack Aug. 6 at their apartment complex in Independence has made her young son, Julien, unrecognizable, news station WDAF reported.

Lyons said she received a call that her fun-loving son was being rushed to the hospital after an 8-year-old neighbor allegedly set him on fire.

The burns were so bad that they had to go in immediately and do surgery that they had to scrape his face and all of his skin, Lyons told the news station.

Doctors told the family that his internal organs, including his lungs, may have been impacted as well.

We really dont know because he inhaled the flames [and] the smoke deteriorated inside his nostrils, Lyons said.

A GoFundMe page was created to help raise money for his medical bills and move the family into safer housing, according to WDAF.

The hospital is trying to release him soon, and were coming up with a home plan but theres no home plan. This is not safe, the mom told the news station.

2018-10-20,New York Post,Warriors saved by Jazz castoffs tip-in before the buzzer,"SALT LAKE CITY  Jonas Jerebko returned to Utah and got what he was looking for.

Jerebko crashed the basket and tipped in a shot against his former team with 0.3 seconds remaining to lift the Golden State Warriors to a 124-123 victory over the Jazz on Friday night.

My teammates knew this was a big game for me coming back here. I wanted to win and told them I really wanted this one, said Jerebko, who couldnt stop smiling after the victory.

Kevin Durant, who scored 38 points, missed a running jumper. But Jerebko, who was let go by Utah as a free agent after last season and who was just subbed in to spread the floor with his long-range shooting ability, charged in from the right side and delivered the game-winning put-back.

I took the ball out, so I knew I was going to give it to K.D. and I knew he was going to shoot it, so I just tried to get to the rim, Jerebko said.

Jerebko, who finished with 10 points, punched the air in celebration and then was mobbed by his new teammates in a scene that looked more like a playoff game than the second game of the season.

To win that game in that way, that was really special, Jerebko said.

Durant thought his last shot was going down, but he couldnt have been happier for Jerebko.

Jonas was there in the right place at the right time. It was very fitting that he comes back here and gets the game-winning tip. We were very excited for him afterwards, Durant said.

The Jazz had taken their last lead when Jae Crowder scored off his own miss with 51.4 seconds left in the game.

Stephen Curry scored 31 points and Draymond Green had 14 points, nine rebounds, six assists and a fistful of attitude.

Joe Ingles paced the Jazz with 27 points, including seven 3-pointers, and Donovan Mitchell added 19 points, but missed all six of his fourth-quarter attempts.

Its more physical, Mitchell said. Theyre taking away my easy looks. I just got to be able to hit the tougher shots. Thats all it is.

Crowder had 17 points and Rudy Gobert had 16 points and 11 rebounds.

Dante Exum gave the Jazz a 111-101 advantage with 8:53 left in the game. The Warriors responded with their most inspired defense of the night and went on a 13-0 run  Draymond Greens layup made it 114-111  to set up the game-ending fireworks.

High scores have been common in the first week of the NBA season, but the Jazz and Warriors took it to a new level, especially in the first half, which ended with Utah leading 81-69.

In a role reversal, the Jazz were the ones letting shots fly from behind the arc with 46 3-point attempts. The Jazz made 19, while the Warriors made 10 of 19 from long range.

After the Warriors whittled their 16-point deficit down to 3, Ingles beat the third-quarter buzzer with a running, double-pump 3-pointer from 37 feet."
2018-03-06,New York Post,Texans not interested in signing players who kneel agents,"The Texans are becoming the face of the anti-kneeling portion of the NFL.

The Houston Chronicle spoke to two agents who said the team would not consider signing players who were seen kneeling during the national anthem. The report states that its not a directive from within the organization, but there is an understanding of which players Houston should pursue in free agency.

Its not Texans owner Bob McNairs first foray into this controversy. McNair, according to ESPN, said in a league meeting last season that the league was letting inmates running the prison. Texans star receiver DeAndre Hopkins skipped a practice after the reports became public in late October and many other players considered walking out.

McNair apologized to the team, arguing the inmates comment was not referencing players, though the Chronicle reports few on the team believed him. Texans players knelt and/or linked arms before their next game.

Yet, the Texans owner has been racially tone deaf often enough that many believe race is a significant factor in how the team runs its business. There are many who believe if McNair could field a team with all-white, all-conforming all-pro talent, he would.

Colin Kaepernick currently has a collusion grievance against the NFL and McNair is one of the many NFL bigwigs who were deposed by the free agent quarterbacks lawyers. Kaepernick started the kneeling movement during the 2016 preseason to protest the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement.

That movement grew when President Trump called in September for any player who kneeled to be released by his team.

Get that son of a bitch off the field, Trump said at a rally.

After that, many other players kneeled or protested in other ways."

listing his penthouse at 230 Central Park South for $17.95 million.

The 4,500-square-foot duplex has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and two half
baths  as well as 50 square feet of outdoor space, all along nearly 100 feet
of Central Park frontage. If the 16th-floor condop looks familiar, its
because it gets a lot of screen time.

Its been filmed for Showtimes Billions; ABCs Madoff, starring Richard

Reisner has long been linked to 230 Central Park South; he owns several of its
45 units. In 2016, according to reports, he sold a unit spanning the
buildings entire 12th floor for $12.6 million. A year later, he allegedly
flipped a triplex there, netting $10.8 million.

This penthouse unit, which hasnt been on the market before, is a combination
of several units. He really had a lot of vision to combine and buy the
units, says Compass Vickey Barron, one of the units brokers.

The building may also sound familiar because, in 2014, gossips said that
socialite and songwriter Denise Rich had purchased a nearly $12 million
penthouse there, though she [actively denied the
purchase](https://pagesix.com/2014/10/23/denise-rich-denies-buying-nyc-

Criminal Deputy Greg Phares said late Friday that Payne escaped the prison in Clinton in 2003 while serving time for burglary. He says the now-44-year-old was arrested in Mexico and is now jailed in Conroe, Texas, awaiting a return to the Louisiana prison  possibly by Monday.

The Advocate reports Payne was serving 12 years for a burglary in Jefferson Parish when he escaped after trimming grass between two security fences. Authorities said at the time that Payne apparently went through a gate he had left unlocked, climbed an 8-foot outer fence and fled.

Its unclear how investigators tracked him down."
2018-07-04,New York Post,Lili Reinhart opens up about her body dysmorphia on social media,"Riverdale star Lili Reinhart is speaking out after social media critics say shes too thin to have body issues.

Feeling really disheartened by the fact that so many people are saying youre skinny so shut up about embrscing [sic] your body,' she tweeted on Wednesday morning. As if my body dysmorphia is irrelevant because of how I look to some people. Im either not curvy enough or not skinny enough to feel insecure.

Reinhart, whos spoken out about her battle with depression and anxiety, added, Mental illness gets worse when people say that you dont have a right to feel the way you do. Thats where we are dailing [sic]. Do not encourage this behavior. It is destructive. More destructive than youll ever realize. You may not understand someones insecurity- but respect it.

The comments stemmed from a recent article in Harpers Bazaar in which the 21-year-old actress said she was inspired by Marilyn Monroes curvy figure because it made her feel like her body would be accepted.

After a Twitter user criticized her, she snapped back, Telling someone they dont deserve to feel insecure because their body is fine or just like whomever.. is wrong. Thats part of the problem. Thats part of body shaming.

I will never understand how someone can be so cowardly as to hide behind their phone and tell a stranger that their feelings are irrelevant and considered whining, just because they think you represent some ideal figure or shape, she added in another tweet."

2018-09-27,New York Post,Busy Philipps husband couldnt understand how to be a dad,"Busy Philipps said her husband let her down after the birth of their first child.

The actress, who has two children with Marc Silverstein, told Parents magazine (via People) the producer didnt try to be a father after their daughter, 10-year-old Birdie Leigh, was born. And things didnt get any better when she raised the idea of having a second child.

He was not understanding how to be a dad and, in fact, didnt try. I was parenting by myself, she told the magazine. When I told him I wanted to have a second child, he said, Fine, but its all on you. That was so heartbreaking.

Although the couple eventually had a second child, 5-year-old Cricket Pearl, Silversteins disinterest in parenting got to be so much she basically gave him an ultimatum.

Marriage is always hard, but especially when you have kids ... Youre going to go through periods when youre not into it, but there always has to be one person willing to fight, she said. I went to Marc several times and said, I cannot do this anymore. Something has to change, and its you.

But the actress made clear that while he wasnt up to the job earlier in their marriage, he has come around, even if there is still progress to be made.

Weve had a lot of serious discussions and counseling, and hes incredibly participatory now in a way I dont think he couldve imagined before, she said. Were a work in progress but trying our best, and thats the most you can do."
2018-11-04,New York Post,Dolphins star safety bizarrely appears to quit on team,"The defense was not the Dolphins problem in Sundays 13-6 win over the Jets. And yet, there was a problem on their defense.

Reshad Jones, a fixture in Miamis defensive backfield since 2010 and a two-time Pro Bowler, pulled himself out of the game, according to head coach Adam Gase. Jones started the game, but by the second quarter the safety was on the sideline. He did not play the entire second half.

Gase said he was not sure if it was injury related. The Miami Herald reported Jones absence from the field was not because of an injury. The Dolphins did not give any injury announcement on Jones, who was not in the locker room when it was opened up to media.

Ill probably learn a little bit more tonight and try to figure out whats going on, Gase said.

Fellow Dolphins players reportedly asked media to address questions about Jones to the coaches.

The mysterious movement, where anonymous diners leave impressively large tips across the country and post about it on social media, originally started in 2013 and lasted until 2015.

But in November 2017, Tips for Jesus resurfaced in New York when Caitlin Cahill, who works at Guyers bar in Manhattan, reportedly received a generous $5,000 gratuity, courtesy of the group.

Over the last two months, the Tips for Jesus Instagram account has posted on three different occasions, the most recent of which featured evidence of a $2,000 tip.

The lucky recipient, Jessica Samford, reportedly works at The Gotham Club in San Francisco, a bar inside AT&T Park, where the San Francisco Giants play. She received the large tip from an anonymous patron on a $490 tab during the Rugby World Cup on Saturday.

Wilson will be reporting to Yankees camp Monday after his rights were traded to New York by the Rangers earlier in the offseason. The Seahawks quarterback played minor league baseball when he was younger, and has attended Rangers camp before. Hell likely just go through drills with the Yankees and sit on the bench for a few games.

That doesnt mean hes not up for a challenge. Wilson took to Instagram on Thursday and said he wants to swing for the fences with Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton.

Hey New York City, Im here, Ive got the Yankees hat on and Im heading to spring training on Monday, Wilson said in a short video posted on social media. I cant wait to see you guys Feb 26 and have some fun that week. Hey Aaron Judge, I know you want to throw some long passes, so lets play some ball. Well have a little home run derby too.

Stanton, Im coming for you too. Lets have some fun. And hey, lets go win a World Series. Why not?

While Seahawks fans might get more excited about the possibility of Judge or Stanton catching passes from Wilson than Yankees fans would be about Wilson trying to make the majors, general manager Brian Cashman is a big fan and said there will be tangible benefits to having the quarterback around.

Weve admired Russells career from afar for quite some time, Cashman said. This is a unique opportunity for us to learn from an extraordinary athlete who has reached the pinnacle of his profession."
2018-07-17,New York Post,Mike Piazzas soccer team goes bust,"Reggiana, the third-division Italian soccer team Mike Piazza agreed to purchase in 2016, has been declared bankrupt, according to reports out of Italy.

The team announced on June 24 that it would not be registering in Serie C for the forthcoming season because of its financial issues.

Five days later, the team had begun negotiations with an ownership group led by businessman Pablo Victor Dana, but those negotiations reportedly have ended unsuccessfully, and Reggiana declined to appeal the June 13 ruling that booted them from Serie C. The club, which was founded in 1919, was relegated from Italys top flight in 1997 and forced to sell the naming rights of its stadium in subsequent years because of financial woes.

Reggiana would be forced to start in Serie D, Italys highest amateur league and a level below, if it bounces back.

Piazza has not responded to The Posts request for comment.

The former catcher, who starred for the Mets from 1998-2005, arrived last year, full of ambition and hope to turn the club around, and it seemed he was making progress initially.

The number of season-ticket holders more than doubled (to 5,243) after he arrived, and fans respected the the Hall of Famer. As of February 2017, Piazza had traveled to Italy seven times, determined to pull the club up the rungs of the Italian soccer pyramid.

Id rather be poor in Italy than based in St. Louis, Piazza, who had explored MLS expansion franchises, said to the New York Times last year. You cant get a good meal there!

Piazza had also expressed frustration with the way Reggiana was being treated by those in charge of Serie A club Sassuolo, whose stadium Reggiana has had to pay to use since its 1997 relegation.

Im tired and sick of Reggiana being pushed around, Piazza said during a press conference in March. I am frustrated, and Im frigging pissed off."

2018-08-08,New York Post,Trump-backed candidate claims victory in special election for Ohio congressional seat,"Republican Troy Balderson claimed victory over Democrat Danny OConnor in a
widely watched special congressional election Tuesday to represent Ohios 12th
District in the House of Representatives.

With all precincts reporting, Balderson, an Ohio state senator who closely
linked himself to President Trump  [appearing with him at a rally last
weekend](https://nypost.com/2018/08/04/trump-rallies-for-gop-house-candidate-
in-ohio/)  held a 0.9 percent lead over OConnor, a county recorder and
moderate Democrat.

Although the razor-thin race had not been called by any major news
organizations, and was automatically going to a recount, Balderson, 56,
delivered a victory speech and both the National Republican Congressional
Committee and Trump put out statements declaring victory for their preferred
candidate.

After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better,
[Trump said in a
tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1027026526871740417). Now
Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He
will win BIG in Nov.

Balderson gave a speech [thanking Trump for his help in
campaigning](https://nypost.com/2018/08/04/trump-rallies-for-gop-house-
candidate-in-ohio/), saying he himself had big shoes to fill in Congress and
that he would do everything I can to make America great again.

OConnor, 34, however, onstage at his campaign headquarters in the central
Ohio district, said the race was a tied ballgame, with a rematch due in
Novembers regular congressional election for the seat, which opened up when
GOP Rep. Pat Tiberi resigned in January.

Were not stopping now, OConnor said. Tomorrow we rest and we keep
fighting through to November.

It was a match-up many Democrats compared to the March special election in a
red district in western Pennsylvania, in which the 34-year-old Democratic
candidate, Conor Lamb, pulled off a victory.

OConnor seemed to have the momentum in the run-up to Tuesdays election.

He had pulled ahead in one poll, despite the district leaning heavily
Republican, with no Democrat having been elected to Congress from there in
more than 30 years.  
Trump won the district by 11 points in 2016.

Balderson had both Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a strong Trump critic, and the
president behind him.

OConnor needed Franklin County  which includes the state capital of Columbus
 to come out strongly for him in order to topple his Republican rival.

He also needed good numbers in neighboring Delaware County. But with 99
percent of precincts reporting, Delaware County had tilted in Baldersons
favor.

Meanwhile, in Michigan, Trump also had a good night. His pick for governor,
Bill Schuette, the states attorney general, easily won the GOP primary.

The presidents Senate pick, John James, whom Trump called a potential
Republican star, also won. James also had help in the state from musician Kid
Rock, who had once flirted with running against incumbent Democratic Michigan
Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Meanwhile [progressive duo Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez (D-Bronx/Queens)](https://nypost.com/2018/07/20/ocasio-cortez-teams-up-
with-sanders-to-campaign-in-kansas/) saw their chosen Michigan Democratic
gubernatorial-primary candidate, Abdul El-Sayed, lose.

El-Sayed, who in the general election could have been in line to become the

2018-09-21,New York Post,Mariska Hargitay reveals the inspiration behind Olivia Benson,"Mariska Hargitay, who has played Detective Olivia Benson on NBCs Law & Order: SVU for 20 years, has revealed the inspiration behind her iconic role.

I think its an amalgamation of my ... strong female friends, Hargitay, 54, said Thursday during a panel discussion celebrating the shows 20th anniversary at the Tribeca TV Festival.

The actress named her co-star Kelli Giddish as one of her muses.

Kelli is one of the strongest people, Id say, in a lot of ways, like, a lot cooler than I am ... so theres so many women that I admire and look up to and I try to grab pieces of those, she said.

Hargitay also looks inside herself while portraying TVs top female detective.

Also, you know, that part of me, that fierce, badass lioness, she said. We play these parts, we have our little selves, all our complex part of our selves, and we draw that self and yeah, shes awesome.

For Giddish, who revealed she is expecting her second child, the feeling is mutual.

Ive had so many great moments with Mariska this year, Giddish, 38, told Page Six. Its been really, really solid and with our relationship, [the writers] didnt just make us be best friends just like that in a kind of false way. Weve earned it, so like, all the behind-the-scenes moments with her, it really means a lot that we can kind of play up that friendship too.

She continued, Its just been a joy to really flush out the friendship between [our characters] and I think the audience is in for a real treat to see that further evolve this year.

Giddish also revealed to us that after two decades, she doesnt see the show slowing down anytime soon.

As long as people are down to write it and [Mariska] is down to be in it. Were having such fun still, you know? And the writing is still really strong, and this doesnt happen, you know? It doesnt happen. And the fans are so great for this show like, all around the whole world, she said."

2018-04-18,New York Post,Chaotic Stitches is in San Juan,"Missed this one last week. Retired linebacker and on-field/off-field menace Ray Obstruction Lewis said on FS1 that Odell Road to Destruction Beckham Jr. has removed God and allowed chaos into his life. Wait ... what? OBJ put on his halo, lifted his leg and shot back at Reverend Ray Ray. Went to Instagram, that haven for angelic postings, and stated his foundation has not been disturbed. Phew ... What a relief. ... Cant help but think this is akin to Mayor de Blasio telling Gov. Cuomo hes doing a terrible job. And vice versa.

Blue Jays played a doubleheader under a leaky roof Tuesday but apparently J.A. Happ wanted no part of it. His start was pushed back a day so our play was taken off the board.

2018-07-18,New York Post,Dr BumBum on the run after patient dies during botched butt enlargement,"A Brazilian celebrity plastic surgeon nicknamed Dr. BumBum is on the run after being accused of killing a patient during a botched procedure to enlarge her rear end.

Lilian Calixto became sick during the procedure at the Rio de Janeiro home of Dr. Denis Furtado on Saturday night.

He took her to the Hospital Barra DOr, but the 46-year-old married mom died early Sunday, police said, according to the BBC.

A judge issued a warrant for the arrest of the 45-year-old celebrity doc on homicide charges  but hed vanished. Cops arrested his girlfriend, Renata Fernandes Cirne, on suspicion of taking part in the procedure.

Furtado has appeared on Brazilian TV, had nearly 650,000 followers on his since-deleted Instagram account and an active Facebook page filled with before-and-after shots of butt enlargement procedures.

But Niveo Steffen, president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society, suggested Dr. BumBum wasnt completely legit, saying there was a growing invasion on non-specialists in the industry.

You cannot perform plastic surgery inside an apartment, he told AFP.

Many people are selling a dream, a fantasy to patients in an unethical way and people, weakened, are often attracted to low prices, without considering whether or not the conditions are adequate.

Friends of Calixto, a former HSBC bank manager, told local media she had always had a dissatisfaction with her butt and had undergone many other procedures to change her appearance.

She did not need it, shes always been beautiful since she was a teenager. I remember her at the age of 16. Everything about her was perfect. ... But a woman is never satisfied with her body, said her friend Lucy Macedo.

She leaves behind a young daughter named Ana Vitoria and a 21-year-old son named Vitor."
2018-10-12,New York Post,WeWork sued over sexual assaults frat-boy culture,"The frat-boy culture at the $20 billion shared-office-space company WeWork breeds drunken sexual misconduct, according to a former employee whos suing over multiple alleged attacks.

Ruby Anaya, 33, was director of culture for WeWork for the past four years until her ouster in August.

Anaya says she was sexually assaulted twice over the course of a few months at booze-fueled, mandatory-attendance company events.

Anaya reported both incidents to the companys human resources department, according to court papers. But nothing was done, the suit says.

She was then fired after complaining about the companys lack of response to the incidents, Anaya says in the Manhattan Supreme Court suit seeking unspecified damages.

A WeWork spokeswoman said, These claims against WeWork are meritless and we will fight this lawsuit. WeWork investigated this employees complaints, took appropriate action, and this employee was terminated solely because of her poor performance."
2018-05-07,New York Post,Trendy Korean restaurant comes to Noho,"It was only a matter of time before trendy Korean food would morph from K-Town to downtown.

The Bari, an authentic blend of Korean food with Japanese influence, launches Monday in Noho.

The restaurant, at 417 Lafayette St., hopes to do for Korean food what Indochine, a New York classic, did for French-Vietnamese food when it opened across the street at 430 Lafayette St. in 1984.

The Bari, which means bowl in Korean, is from restaurateur Danny Hahn of Maru Kitchen and Dong Chun Hong, and co-owner chef Mason Rhee, previously of Miss Korea, Haru Hana and Shanghai Mong.

Signature dishes include steamed bone marrow with kimchi and bread crumbs, and soju braised gochujang ribs topped with Korean miso. Theres also the bari (bowl) jewel with uni king crab, ebi, ikura and sashimi over rice; and uni bibimbap with minced and pickled root vegetables, quinoa puffs, tobiko and nori rice.

2018-05-21,New York Post,Didi Gregorius shows maturity with how he handled benching,"KANSAS CITY, Mo.  Given the choice, Didi Gregorius wouldnt have been tethered to the bench Sunday for the second straight game. However, the easy-going and slumping shortstop understood the situation.

I am not the one who makes the lineup, I cant be disappointed, Gregorius said when asked if he was disappointed about not being in the lineup for a second consecutive game in which the Royals started a left-hander. I do want to play, but there is not much we can do about it. We talked about it [Saturday].

If Gregorius did fill out the lineup card, he might have thought twice about writing his name in because of a 1-for-45 slump he believes is a product of hard-hit balls finding leather instead of holes.

If I am making good contact hard and making outs, there is nothing I can do about it, said Gregorius, who was the AL Player of the Month for April when he hit an MLB-leading 10 homers and drove in 30 runs.

A younger Gregorius wouldnt have taken a two-day benching as well as the 28-year-old model.

You learn from playing all those years. Back then, I know myself, I would have smashed and broke a lot of stuff. Now its part of the game and you mature, Gregorius said. After a good first month and nothing happening the second month, and you guys can look back at everything I said in the beginning, You have to enjoy it while it lasts because slumps are going to come.

Aaron Boone, who started Ronald Torreyes (3-for-9 in the last two games) at short on Saturday and Sunday, said Gregorius will return to the lineup Monday against the Rangers in Texas where the Yankees will face ancient right-hander Bartolo Colon. However, the manager didnt commit to reinserting the left-handed hitting Gregorius in the No. 3 spot between Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton.

I dont know, we will see where we are roster-wise and match-up wise. See how it plays out, Boone said of Gregorius hitting third, where he has batted 23 times this season.

On Saturday, Boone said it was a combo day off since Gregorius bat was dead and the Royals started lefty Danny Duffy.

I feel like its a good pause for him and kind of take a mental break, Boone said of sitting Gregorius for a second straight game when the Royals started lefty Eric Skoglund. Maybe a chance for him to recharge, mentally and physically, and hit the ground running when we get to Texas [Monday].

If Greg Bird doesnt suffer a setback, there is a chance the left-handed hitting first baseman will come off the disabled list before the weekend.

I think its reasonable sometime in the next week we will see him, Aaron Boone said of Bird returning from late March ankle surgery. Its a matter of bouncing back and getting into the rhythm of playing nine innings.

Bird, who recently joined Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre has split a rehab assignment between Double-A Trenton and SWB. He didnt play Sunday. He is 4-for-23 (.174) with a homer and three RBIs in eight games.

Miguel Andujar went 3-for-5 with a triple and homer. That extended his lead among AL rookies in multi-hit games with 14 and extra-base hits with 18. The homer was Andujars fourth of the season, his first since April 23 and stopped a homerless streak of 93 at-bats. ... The Yankees, 12-3 against lefty starters, will face Rangers lefty Cole Hamels on Tuesday."
2018-07-24,New York Post,Little girl reunited with toy lion lost on remote hike,"BEND, Ore.  A little girl who lost her beloved stuffed lion on a hike in the Oregon backcountry was reunited with her favorite toy over the weekend after a community effort to identify her.

Hiker Holly Spaman, who recently moved to Bend, Oregon, from Yakima, Washington, ran into Audrianna Flores and her family as they descended Broken Top Trail on July 16 on their way back from a hike to the remote No Name Lake.

The distraught 7-year-old told Spaman about her lost stuffed lion, Kitty, which had fallen out of her mothers backpack unnoticed during the trek, the mother, Erin Allen, told The Associated Press on Monday.

Spaman didnt think shed find the toy in such a vast wilderness, but she kept her eyes peeled and spotted Kitty a few miles later.

She didnt have the familys name or number. So she put Kitty on a rock and snapped a photo of the well-loved beige-and-yellow lion in front of jagged peaks of Broken Top Mountain  snow in the background  and posted it online when she got home.

Yesterday late afternoon I met a sweet child on Broken Top Trail to No Name Lake who asked me to keep an eye out for her stuffed animal, Spaman wrote. Guess what? I found it! If anyone knows this kiddo, please help us connect.

Spamans friends forwarded her note, which was then passed on to complete strangers as everyone tried to reconnect the girl with her lost lion.

The Bulletin, the local newspaper, joined the search and after almost a week of community effort, a very happy Audrianna was reunited with Kitty on Saturday.

On Monday, Allen told the AP that her daughter was sleeping  undoubtedly with Kitty  and wasnt available for an interview.

This has been truly amazing  all of the kind people out there in this world, Allen said."
2018-08-30,New York Post,Idris Elba defends casting controversies after James Bond rejection,"Idris Elba is defending Dwayne Johnsons Jungle Cruise movie after it cast straight actor Jack Whitehall to play Disneys first openly gay character.

Artistic license is artistic license. If an actor has the attributes to do something, they should be able to do it, Elba told TimeOut London, via Attitude magazine. Theyre acting.

He continued, You dont necessarily have to be gay to play a gay character. Though you do have to be black to play a black character.

Elbas comments come after he said he definitively would not be taking over Daniel Craigs role as James Bond. The author of the continuation Bond series, Anthony Horowitz, once said Elba was too street to play the suave agent.

Its like the debate about James Bond. Its nonsense. Its a fictional character. Ive got mad respect for how Ian Fleming described him, Elba explained. He said he was a white guy, looked like this ... Thats how it was written. But then theres interpretation.

If we were always bound by the confines that something has to be [one way], people would never have expanded on things and come up with some of the most genius ideas."
2018-09-11,New York Post,Putin Xi make pancakes together,"Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and Chinas Xi Jinping buttered each other up Tuesday  tossing pancakes on the sidelines of an economic forum.

Donning blue aprons, the two leaders were photographed pouring batter, flipping Russian pancakes  called blini  and consuming them with caviar and a shot of vodka in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok.

Placing their historic rivalry on the back burner, the historic rivals projected a united front amid pressure from Washington, which is fighting a trade war with China and leveling new sanctions on Russia.

Both countries are trying to signal: If the United States pushes too far, we are going to move closer to each other, Alexander Gabuev, chairman of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, told the Washington Post.

On Tuesday, Xi brought a delegation of almost 1,000 Chinese business people and officials to the Eastern Economic Forum, a Putin-led effort to lure foreign investors.

After hours of talks, Putin brought Xi down to the Sea of Japan waterfront, where the presidents cooked up the blini at the Far East Street exhibit of the regions cultural and economic achievements.

You and I work together most closely, Xi told Putin. Im prepared to further deepen our exchange of views and our tight coordination, both today and in the future.

This was not their first foray into flapjacks. During a visit to China in June, Putin made a Chinese pancake, which Xi tried."
2018-03-05,New York Post,Uber sued after data stolen by hackers covered up,"HARRISBURG, Pa.  The ride-hailing company Uber broke Pennsylvania law when it failed to notify potential victims, including thousands of drivers, for a year after it discovered hackers had stolen their personal information, said the state attorney general, who sued the company Monday.

The lawsuit, filed in Philadelphia, said hackers stole the names and drivers license numbers of at least 13,500 Pennsylvania Uber drivers. It accused Uber of violating a state law requiring it to notify victims of a data breach within a reasonable time frame.

Instead of notifying impacted consumers of the breach within a reasonable amount of time, Uber hid the incident for over a year  and actually paid the hackers to delete the data and stay quiet, state Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a statement. Thats just outrageous corporate misconduct, and Im suing to hold them accountable and recover for Pennsylvanians.

Shapiros office did not have details about riders who were affected, but asked Pennsylvanians who believes they may have been harmed by the Uber hack to file a complaint with the office.

Uber revealed in November that hackers in 2016 had stolen the names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers of 57 million riders around the world. The thieves also nabbed the drivers license numbers of 600,000 Uber drivers in the U.S. The breach did not include any credit card information or Social Security information, Uber said.

When it revealed the hack, Uber said there was no evidence the stolen data had been misused. It acknowledged paying the hackers $100,000 to destroy the stolen information.

Washington state and Chicago have sued Uber, and attorneys general in other states have said they were investigating Ubers data breach.

Uber said it is cooperating with Pennsylvania investigators.

Ive been up front about the fact that Uber expects to be held accountable; our only ask is that Uber be treated fairly and that any penalty reasonably fit the facts, Uber said in statement from its chief legal officer, Tony West.

The lawsuit seeks civil penalties into the millions of dollars, including $1,000 for each violation of consumer protection laws and $3,000 for each violation involving a victim who is 60 or older.

It is the first time Pennsylvania has sued under a 12-year-old state law that makes failing to notify potential victims of a breach of personal information punishable under consumer protection laws."

I was allowed to watch Sesame Street and The Cosby Show and Little House on the Prairie. 

She added, I snuck in a little CHiPs,  which was the first kind of Woah! What am I feeling? kind of moments.

Baldwin responded, Thats why I liked Gilligans Island. Ginger  those feelings.

2018-05-07,New York Post,Putin sworn in for another six years as president,"Vladimir Putin vowed to pursue economic changes to help boost living standards as he was sworn in to his fourth term as Russian president on Monday.

Now, we must use all existing possibilities, first of all for resolving internal urgent tasks of development, for economic and technological breakthroughs, for raising competitiveness in those spheres that determine the future, he told the crowd gathered at the Andreevsky Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace.

A new quality of life, well-being, security and peoples health  thats whats primary today, he added.

Putin, who won Marchs election with 77 percent of the vote and faced no serious challengers, said Russia will also retain a powerful international role.

Russia is a strong, active, influential participant in international life. The security and defense capability of the country is reliably ensured. We will give these matters the necessary constant attention,  he said.

Speaking of the challenges facing the country, Putin reminded the crowd of Russias resilience.

We all remember well that, for more than a thousand years of history, Russia has often faced epochs of turmoil and trials, and has always revived as a Phoenix, reached heights that others could not,  he said.

Putins Russia has been embroiled in controversy.

The country is facing sanctions for its meddling in the 2016 election and for orchestrating the nerve-gas poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in England in March.

The Putin regime is also propping up Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad."

2018-09-28,New York Post,Honda recalls more than 200000 cars over software problem,"TOKYO  Honda is recalling about 232,000 2018 Accord vehicles and 2019 Insight hybrid cars in the U.S. for malfunctioning software for the rear camera display.

There have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to the problem, Honda Motor Co. spokeswoman Tomoko Takemori said Friday.

The Tokyo-based automaker said that apart from the U.S. recall, Honda is recalling 14,000 vehicles in Canada, more than 6,000 vehicles in Germany and nearly 3,000 in South Korea for the same problem.

The software will be updated free of charge, the company said.

It said the rear camera display does not show the images properly when the driver shifts into rear in the affected vehicles, a problem that can be dangerous and does not comply with U.S. requirements."
2018-06-17,New York Post,Woman fatally stabbed by ex at Belmont Park race track cops,"A Belmont Park stablehand was fatally stabbed by her former boyfriend as she was walking a horse at the famed Nassau County racetrack early Sunday, authorities said.

The worker  identified by police sources as Maria Larin  was cooling down a horse following a workout around 6:30 a.m. when her assailant ran up to her in a barn and knifed her multiple times, cops said.

The spooked horse took off at a gallop, alerting Belmont security that something was wrong.

Security became alarmed because the horse became free at that point, said Det. Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick, head of the Nassau County Homicide Squad. So when they came responding to see what happened to the horse ... they discovered [Larin] with multiple stab wounds.

Track security gave the 51-year-old first aid and emergency responders rushed her to an area hospital, but she could not be saved.

The alleged killer  identified by cops as Larins one-time boyfriend  was nabbed outside the barn by a group of stablehands and a New York Racing Association guard, who held him until cops arrived, reported Daily Racing Form.

Weve come to determine that this is not a random act, Fitzpatrick said. This is a targeted incident.

Cops and Belmont security are working to determine how the suspect, whose identity wasnt immediately released, made it onto the premises.

Authorities said he formerly worked at the racetrack, which last Sunday played host to Justifys historic, Triple Crown-clinching run."

Bankruptcy Court Judge Christopher Sontchi said the $289 million deal can go forward  despite the objections of actors and directors who fear a change of ownership could jeopardize their profit-participation payments.

2018-04-12,New York Post,Tesla squabbles with federal regulators over autopilot crash,"Tesla is on a collision course with federal regulators  but its shifting into high gear anyway.

Billionaire Elon Musks electric-car maker blasted the National Transportation Safety Board on Thursday, accusing the agency of being more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety.

That was after the NTSB said it had removed Tesla as a party in its investigation of the fiery March 23 crash of a Model X outside San Francisco, in which driver Walter Huang died after hitting a concrete median while in Autopilot mode.

The NTSB said it clamped down because Tesla had violated an agreement not to disclose details of the crash while it was investigating. Tesla revealed March 30 that Huang had received several warnings from the Autopilot software to put his hands back on the steering wheel in the seconds leading up to the crash.

Tesla, however, claimed on Thursday it made the decision to leave the investigation to better fend off claims which made it seem as though Autopilot creates safety problems when the opposite is true.

Tesla said it sympathized with Huangs family, but nevertheless blamed Huang again on Wednesday, saying the driver was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect. Whats more, Tesla said Huang had previously complained that Autopilot appeared faulty on the stretch of highway in Mountain View, Calif., where he died.

That was after Huangs family said it had hired law firm Minami Tamaki LLP to explore legal options, adding the firm believed the Autopilot feature probably caused his death. The firm said its preliminary review of the crash suggested Autopilot was defective.

The NTSB complained that releasing incomplete information often leads to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash, which does a disservice to the investigative process and the traveling public.

Tesla countered that it chose to go public with the information because it couldnt wait on the NTSBs 12-24 month process while speculation about the crash intensified.

Tesla claimed that while there is one automotive death every 86 million miles in the US, while for Teslas equipped with Autopilot that number dips to one in every 320 million miles.

You are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident in a Tesla, the company insisted.

All this comes after NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said that he had a constructive conversation with Musk over the weekend.

It is unfortunate that Tesla, by its actions, did not abide by the party agreement, Sumwalt said in a statement on Thursday.

Tesla said that even though we wont be a formal party, we will continue to provide technical assistance to the NTSB."
2018-09-29,New York Post,These adults live like Disney characters every day,"If you can dream it, you can do it.

Just look at these Disney obsessives, who have taken their fandom from theme-park visits to a way of life  spending shocking amounts of time and money hand-sewing character costumes for themselves and decorating their homes like a Disney World resort.

Disney is notoriously stingy with data on guest habits from its venues, but in the third quarter of 2018, revenue from the parks and resorts increased 6 percent to $5.2 billion. And while most of those people dont make their Disney love an integral part of their identities, its worth noting that about 1,500 couples get married at the parks each year, and more than 25,000 compete in the annual princess-themed half-marathon.

Here are four locals for whom childs play is every day.

Each February, tens of thousands of runners  most of them women  take part in the Disney Princess Half-Marathon in Orlando, racing 13.1 miles through Epcot and the Magic Kingdom as the sun rises over Cinderellas castle.

In 2015, Lauren Passell won, and the 34-year-old East Village resident considers the victory a Disney miracle. In February of 2014, walking to work, I fell and my hips just shattered, Passell said. [Doctors] told me I probably wouldnt be able to run again.

But she came back  and, to celebrate, dressed as her favorite character, Tinker Bell, for the race. Shes not perfect. She has a personality. Shes kind of sassy, said the social-media strategist of Tink. I feel like wed be friends.

Though her family wasnt able to afford many visits to the theme park when she was growing up, Passell now tries to visit four times a year, often with her mom. Beyond a Disney cruise and trip to the Disney resort in Hawaii, her love of the characters extends to everyday touches, including workout wear and Ariel-themed sneakers. I have Disney underwear. Im going to sound like a crazy person, but it makes me so happy, Passell said.

As for overcoming her injury to win, Passel  who crossed the finish line with a wand in her hand  said: I do feel like there was some sort of magic . . . in me that day. Its [about] believing, and thats a huge tenet of Disney. You know, A dream is a wish your heart makes.

Some 1,500 couples get married at Disney parks every year. On July 13, 2015, Nicole and Rick Nunnari joined them, tying the knot at the Beach Club Resort in Orlando, Fla., two years after he popped the question at Disney World.

When Rick proposed, he asked me to be his Disney princess, Nicole, now 36, said. She had never actually been to the park before meeting Rick, 38, but the life-changing event made her fall in love with the place. The couple even commissioned a professional, $950 photo shoot at Epcot for their one-year anniversary: dressing in formal wear and posing at international pavilions including Italy (his background), France (her background) and Germany (Snow White is said to take place there, and that storys signature red apple was one of Nicoles props).

The couples new home in Annadale, Staten Island, is inspired by the place where they wed. Said Nicole, We are transforming the inside into a Marthas Vineyard beach cottage, which reflects the style of the Disney Beach Club Resort  right down to the scented room spray. I know its kind of psychotic.

Both Rick and Nicole are teachers, and she also sells custom illustrations (about $135 apiece) she creates of couples at Disney, typically for weddings.

I wear [Mickey Mouse] ears to work sometimes, said Nicole, who teaches first grade at the Hellenic Classical Charter School. My classroom is Disney [inspired], I play Disney music. I dont think I could ever live without it.

As a child, Sinead Atkinson was sure she was royalty.

I was very annoying, I suppose, since I insisted that my preschool teachers address me as Princess and I wouldnt answer them if they called me the character I was [the day before], said the Hauppauge, LI-based actress.

Now 26, Atkinson is regularly hired to dress up as various characters from the Disney canon  including Belle, Ariel, Snow White, Cinderella and Anna from Frozen  for kids parties. She also dons costumes, which can cost as much as $1,000, for ComicCon and cosplay conventions.

As an adult, Im still drawn to [the princesses] strength of heart and kindness  especially Snow White, said Atkinson. In spite of everything shes been through, she remains kind, optimistic, forgiving and friendly, even to those who have wronged her in the past.

Atkinson is also a Disneybounder  someone who works subtle, princess-inspired sartorial touches into her day-to-day-wardrobe. Brands like Hot Topic and Her Universe manufacture clothes specifically for this.

They sold a purple and pink ombre dress, she said. If you know Tangled, you know thats Rapunzel, but if you dont, then its just a cool dress.

I think women are more vocal about their love of Disney, admitted Kohl Lewis. But [the number of male fans] is probably equal.

In fact, hardly anyone can beat his devotion. The 25-year-old, who is a supervisor at Sugar Factory on the Upper West Side, spends up to 400 hours creating his hand-sewn getups for villainous characters such as Cruella de Vil from 101 Dalmatians and Maleficent, which he wears  complete with size 15, 5-inch-high heels  to ComicCon.

Hes lucky, however: Lewis late mom worked as an event coordinator for Parsons School of Design, leaving piles of fabric stacked in the basement of the Fort Greene brownstone he shares with his sisters. The money he saves on materials goes to buy collectibles, from old VHS tapes of movies to a replica of the sewing book that Cinderella consults when making her ball gown.

Lewis is also part of a local MeetUp group, Disney Fanatics, which has more than 350 members and hosts about four events a month, from trivia nights to movie outings.

He dresses up when the group goes to see The Little Mermen, an energetic Disney cover band.

One place he doesnt wear his elaborate outfits? To Disney World.

The parks, he explained, have a strict rule [against] people over 14 wearing costumes...because Disney doesnt want children to confuse another guest for an official park character."

2018-02-28,New York Post,Clinton blasts Trump for ignoring Russia meddling,"Hillary Clinton took to President Trumps favorite social media platform Wednesday to slam him for not doing enough to combat Russias continued meddling in US elections  including the 2018 midterms.

I say this as a former Secretary of State and as an American: the Russians are still coming. Our intelligence professionals are imploring Trump to act. Will he continue to ignore & surrender, or protect our country, the former first lady tweeted at 10:45 a.m.

Clinton added a link to a Washington Post report on Adm. Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, who told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Russian strongman Vladimir Putin will ramp up his efforts to meddle in the midterms and beyond.

Putin, he said, has clearly come to the conclusion that theres little price to pay here and therefore I can continue this activity.

If we dont change the dynamic here, this is going to continue, Rogers said. Were taking steps, but were probably not doing enough.

The NSA chief also told lawmakers that Trump had not authorized him to take any extra measures to stop Russian interference in US elections.

Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not reply directly when asked about Rogers comments.

Were focused on looking at a variety of different ways, she said Tuesday.

The president routinely attacks Clinton on Twitter, generally referring to her as Crooked Hillary.

Now that [Rep.] Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasnt I a great candidate? he wrote on Feb. 18 in a typical tweet.

But the ex-secretary of state only sporadically goes after him in her own tweets  although she does regularly retweet posts that are critical of Trump.

Her last direct attack came on Jan. 12, when she slammed him for reportedly referring to Haiti as a sthole country, tweeting: The anniversary of the devastating earthquake 8 years ago is a day to remember the tragedy, honor the resilient people of Haiti, & affirm Americas commitment to helping our neighbors. Instead, were subjected to Trumps ignorant, racist views of anyone who doesnt look like him."

2018-10-20,New York Post,Dodgers will punch World Series ticket,"Balls! Mega Millions jackpot crossed the billion-dollar mark for Friday nights drawing. Marilyn Manson surely purchased a ticket or two after having a tough time of it this past year  among other things, simulating a mass shooting the same day an actual one occurred.

 To his credit, Manson is taking stock of himself and will be selling a dildo with his face on it for just $125. Package includes a soft lifelike piece and a bag for easy and discreet storage.

Also, the paint on the faux Mansons face is environmentally safe [but] may fade with multiple uses. Sales said to be brisk for the entertainer who collapsed in August because of undisclosed health reasons. Giants coach Pat Shurmur believes Manson may have been dehydrated because he just doesnt like drinking water.

Brewers survive. They forced a Game 7 with a dominating 7-2 victory over Dodgers. Scored four runs in the first off Hyun-Jin Ryu and cruised. Jesus Aguilar went 3-for-4 with three RBIs. Win has us at -960 aqualungs. ...

We are switching dugouts Saturday. Believed all along the Dodgers are the better team, and well back them for 20 units in the do-or-die affair."
2018-05-23,New York Post,Federal prosecutors to investigate sex assault allegations against Weinstein,"Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the sexual assault allegations leveled against Harvey Weinstein.

The disgraced movie moguls lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Wednesday that hes met with federal prosecutors in Manhattan in an attempt to dissuade them from proceeding with the probe.

Mr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in nonconsensual acts, said Brafman.

The feds had already been investigating possible fraud in Weinstein-arranged financial transactions to an AIDS charity  but expanded the probe to include the sexual assault accusations, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Theyre trying to determine whether Weinstein forced women to travel across state lines to commit sex crimes, the Journal said.

The 66-year-old dad is already under investigation by local authorities in Los Angeles and Manhattan, where a grand jury is currently weighing criminal charges.

He stands accused of sexually assaulting and harassing more than 80 women  including Lucia Evans, who said once powerful film producer forced her to perform oral sex on him in his Tribeca office in 2004, and Boardwalk Empire actress Paz de la Heurta, who claimed he twice raped her in

 2010.

Two NYPD officials told the Journal that the NYPD is ready to arrest Weinstein  and is just waiting for the OK by the Manhattan DAs Office, which came under fire for previously declining to prosecute him for the alleged sexual assault of Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez."
2018-08-03,New York Post,Trumps voting commission did not find voter fraud ex-member,"The commission established by President Trump to investigate his allegations of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election found no evidence to substantiate the claims, a member of the now-disbanded group said in a letter released Friday.

I have reviewed the Commission documents made available to me and they do not contain evidence of widespread voter fraud, wrote Maines secretary of state Matthew Dunlap in a letter to commission chair Vice President Mike Pence and fellow member Kris Kobach, secretary of state from Kansas.

Trump established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May 2017 to look into his claims that millions of unregistered voters illegally cast ballots for his rival Hillary Clinton, leading to his losing the popular vote.

Dunlap, a Democrat, endured a rocky tenure on the Pence-helmed group, even filing a suit against the commission in November 2017 alleging that other members purposely withheld documents and information from him.

Dunlap wrote in the letter released Friday that the commission suffered from troubling bias in favor of the Trump administration, and that he felt, dissenting or even questioning voices were unwelcome.

He ultimately won his federal lawsuit, with a judge ordering the panel to provide him with all the documents he requested.

It was those documents that led Dunlap to his conclusion that there was no evidence to support the claims of mass voter fraud.

Trump, who once alleged without providing evidence that 3 to 5 million illegal votes were cast for Clinton, dissolved the commission in January."
2018-11-11,New York Post,White House names the latest Medal of Freedom recipients,"A king, a sultan, a senator, two judges, a major GOP donor and Captain America  these are the latest recipients of the nations highest civilian honor.

The White House on Saturday named seven people who will be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom this Friday.

The list includes posthumous awards for Elvis Presley, often called the King of Rock n Roll, Yankees great Babe Ruth, a.k.a. the Sultan of Swat, and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative stalwart.

Also receiving the award are Roger Staubach, a Vietnam War vet and legendary Dallas Cowboys quarterback known as Captain America during his 11 Hall-of-Fame seasons; and Alan Page, a retired Minnesota Supreme Court justice and former football star at Notre Dame. The White House praised Page, who was also a NFL Hall-of-Famer, for giving scholarship to nearly 7,000 students.

Retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican senator in U.S. history, is another winner.

The Utah pol, one of President Trumps strongest backers in Congress, is the 28th senator to receive the award.

Likely the most controversial recipient is Miriam Adelson, a doctor and philanthropist who with her husband, Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, has donated millions to Republican causes, including Trump.

Adelson is receiving the honor for her work as a committed doctor, philanthropist and humanitarian, according to the White House press release, which cited her efforts founding two research centers for fighting substance abuse and the Adelson Medical Research Foundation. Her work supporting Jewish schools, Holocaust memorial organizations and several Israeli causes was also praised.

But critics pounced on the fact that the couple gave over $100 million to Republican campaigns for the midterm elections. They also served as finance vice chairs of the presidents inaugural committee.

Some detractors also criticized Trump for giving awards to dead people, but posthumous awards are routine for presidents of both parties.

Former President John F. Kennedy created the Medal of Freedom in 1963 for especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, or world peace. or cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.

At least 70 people, including Kennedy himself, have received posthumous awards."
2018-05-02,New York Post,Hall of Famer takes another favorite into Kentucky Derby,"LOUISVILLE, Ky.  Bob Baffert had no chance to fret over the Kentucky Derby draw.

By the time the Hall of Fame trainer managed to get into Churchill Downs, the process was halfway done and Justify had landed in the No. 7 post on Tuesday.

We didnt want the 1-hole, thats for sure, the four-time Derby winner said. I was relieved when I saw him in seven.

Justify was made the early 3-1 favorite for the Derby, with Europe-based Mendelssohn the second choice in a full field of 20 horses.

Six horses have won from the No. 7 post, most recently Street Sense in 2007.

The only reason Im the favorite is because I beat Bolt dOro and he was the horse to beat, said Baffert, referring to Justifys three-length win over his rival in the Santa Anita Derby last month.

Justify is one of two horses in Saturdays 114-mile race who didnt race at age 2. The other is 6-1 third choice Magnum Moon. No horse since Apollo in 1882 has won the Derby after not racing as a 2-year-old.

I dont buy into the Apollo Curse or whatever at all, mainly because Bob Baffert and Todd Pletcher have got the horses, four-time Derby-winning trainer D. Wayne Lukas said. Todds going to have his [horse] ready, and Baffert is going to have his.

Justify is 3-0 in his brief career, winning by a combined 19 lengths. Magnum Moon is 4-0, winning the Arkansas Derby and Rebel Stakes in his last two starts.

Its one of the toughest Derbies Ive ever seen, Baffert said. All the important horses got good draws.

More history is working against Mendelssohn. A horse coming from Europe has never won Americas biggest race. Trained by Irishman Aidan OBrien, UAE Derby winner Mendelssohn is the 5-1 second choice. He drew the No. 14 post.

OBrien wasnt at the draw and Mendelssohn wont hit the Churchill Downs dirt strip until Wednesday after clearing quarantine. The colt arrived Monday from Ireland.

Pletcher has a leading four horses in the field: Magnum Moon, 8-1 Audible, 12-1 Vino Rosso and 30-1 Noble Indy. He surpassed Lukas, his mentor, this year as the trainer with the most starters in Derby history with 52.

Pletcher won last year with Always Dreaming.

The main starting gate holds 14 horses and a six-stall auxiliary gate is attached. Horses are loaded into the gate two at a time, beginning with posts one and 11, which spend the most time waiting for the start.

Having three of the four horses in the auxiliary gate wasnt what we were hoping for, Pletcher said. Sometimes you can work out good trips from out there. Weve got four terrific riders.

The co-fourth choices are 8-1: Audible and Bolt dOro.

Bolt dOro has won four of six career starts for trainer and owner Mick Ruis. The colt drew the No. 11 post, which means he will be waiting the longest for the gate to open. Firenze Fire drew the dreaded No. 1 post and also will be standing the longest.

Were good, Ruis said. Bolt is so well-minded that he doesnt work himself up.

Bafferts other entry, 30-1 shot Solomini, drew the No. 17 post, which has never produced a Derby winner.

Lukas, the 82-year-old Hall of Famer, has his 49th Derby starter in Bravazo. The colt is one of five 50-1 shots in the field. In that group is Lone Sailor, owned by Gayle Benson, the widow of the New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson.

Bravazo is owned by Calumet Farm, which has won a leading eight Derbies but none since 1968 when Calumets Forward Pass was declared the winner after Dancers Image was disqualified because of a positive drug test.

Seven horses were listed at 30-1 by Churchill Downs oddsmaker Mike Battaglia: Free Drop Billy, Promises Fulfilled, Flameaway, My Boy Jack, Enticed, Solomini and Noble Indy.

The Desormeaux brothers have teamed with My Boy Jack. Kent Desormeaux, a three-time Derby winner, will ride, while Keith Desormeaux does the training.

The field is limited to the top 20 horses based on points earned in designated prep races.

Twenty-one horses were entered. The 21st horse on the points list is Blended Citizen, who would need a defection by early Friday morning to get into the 144th edition of the race.

If all 20 horses start, the total purse would be $2,192,000. The winner earns $1,432,000. Post time is 6:46 p.m. EDT."
2018-10-16,New York Post,Know what to look for with Astros heading back home,"Is Minute Maid Park now neutral for hitters? That may strike many of you as an odd question, from different ends of the spectrum.

For years, announcers and fans have called Minute Maid a bandbox that was a dream park for hitters because of its short outfield dimensions. This was counter to overwhelming statistical evidence (and relative lack of high-scoring shootouts featuring home runs) suggesting that it was in fact, a great pitchers park (it ranked as the best stadium for hurlers in both 2016 and 2017 of all 30 major league parks).

Franchise management has been making changes to the hitting backdrop that may have evened things out. Prior to the 2017 season, a large batters eye made of Astro Turf was erected in dead center field. That by itself didnt have much of an effect. But in August of 2017, additional tweaks to eliminate distracting lighting from outfield restaurants and advertising material finally made hitters happy.

Though one season doesnt provide enough of a sample size to draw conclusions, the numbers speak for themselves:

Note that park factors compare home games to road games in each season. That chart isnt saying the Astros offensive firepower changed in 2018. What had been a huge scoring difference between the teams road games and home games disappeared this past season.

So, if you were thinking Minute Maid was a bandbox that increased scoring because home runs were so easy, bring those expectations down. If you were thinking this was a pitchers paradise because poor visibility impaired hitters, consider bringing those expectations up.

At least three more 2018 playoff showdowns will be contested at the site. Game 3 of the ALCS is late Tuesday afternoon (TBS, 5:10 p.m.). Games 4 and 5 will be Wednesday and Thursday nights. If Houston advances to the World Series, it would host games 1-2-6-7 versus the NL representative.

Through two meetings, both the Red Soxs and Astros offenses have shown timely efficiency:

Houston is still the series favorite after earning a road split. But, as we discussed Monday in the Brewers-Dodgers series, the laws of probability show its hard to sweep three straight home games versus a quality opponent even if youre favored in all of them."
2018-08-01,New York Post,People are spending more time than ever staring at screens,"Americans spend more time than ever watching videos, browsing social media and swiping their lives away on their tablets and smartphones. American adults spend more than 11 hours per day watching, reading, listening to or simply interacting with media, according to a new study by market-research group Nielsen. Thats up from nine hours, 32 minutes just four years ago.

In the first quarter of the year, US adults spent three hours and 48 minutes a day on computers, tablets and smartphones. This is a 13-minute increase from the previous quarter and 62 percent of that time is attributed to app/web browsing on smartphones. Television still accounts for most media usage, with four hours and 46 minutes spent watching TV every day in the first quarter of this year.

But the time spent on video game consoles and internet-connected devices such as Google Chromecast, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV rose to 40 minutes per day from 35 minutes per day from the previous quarter; 26 of those minutes are on internet-connected devices and the rest are on game consoles, Nielsen said.

Media use is reaching new levels of intensity. Parents with children aged eight to 18 years of age spend over nine hours with screen media each day, according to a 2016 survey of 1,700 such parents by Common Sense Media, a San Francisco-based organization that examines the impact of technology and media on families.

That compares to the more than 4.5 hours tweens spend on screen media on average every day and 6.5 hours spent by teenagers every day, according to a separate 2015 survey of more than 2,650 children by the same organization. Based on Nielsens latest report, however, the time people spend online has increased significantly, even over the last four years.

And that swiping is expensive: Apple stock cleared the $200 mark on Wednesday after the reporting better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results late Tuesday, making it increasingly likely that Apple will be the first US company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization. The companys profit was helped by app sales and increasingly expensive iPhones. The iPhone X costs $999."
2018-09-13,New York Post,City Council approves bill to add third gender on birth certificates,"The City Council on Wednesday approved legislation that will allow New Yorkers to select a third gender category on their birth certificates.

The change, which has the backing of Mayor de Blasio, ensures a new non-binary identity category known as X will be available on birth certificates for those who dont consider their gender to be male or female.

It was approved 41-6 in a Council vote.

Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who introduced the legislation, said it will make New York birth certificates more inclusive for all and will send a powerful signal to the world that New York City government works for everyone.

But Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens), who voted against the bill, told The Post afterwards that hes concerned it will open the door to abuse and other public safety issues.

Just having anyone  without going through a doctor  say theyre another gender or X; that could lead to abuse and all sorts of problems, he said. We need more oversight.

How does X describe a person? Dont we have to have some standards and order? he asked.

Under the bill, transgender New Yorkers will no longer need a letter from a physician or an affidavit by a licensed health care provider to change their gender on the government form. Instead, those born in the Big Apple will be able to submit their own affidavit requesting a gender-identity change."
2018-08-03,New York Post,Dish soap helps free girl stuck in rock formation,"SANDSTONE, Minn.  Rescuers used dish soap to help free a 13-year-old girl who became wedged in a rock formation at a quarry in Pine County.

St. Louis County Rescue Squad Capt. Rick Slatten says the girl was trapped in a crack in the rock for about 4 hours Wednesday while crews worked to get her out. Slatten says the crack, more than 30 feet off the ground, is familiar to those visiting the Robinson Quarry on the Kettle River in Sandstone, but that it would take someone with the right sized limbs to get stuck.

KBJR-TV reports five rescuers climbed down the face of the cliff and used an extraction tool to remove rock. They also applied dish soap to the girls leg to help free her.

The girl was treated at the hospital."
2018-08-28,New York Post,Kylie Jenner joins Kendall and Kanye as an Adidas ambassador,"The reality star, 21, shared via social media on Tuesday that shes the newest member of the Kardashian-Jenner family to sign a contract with Adidas.

Her older sister Kendall, 22, inked a deal with the brand in May 2017, while her brother-in-law Kanye West has worked with Adidas on his Yeezy line since 2015.

The younger Jenner sister had been under contract with Puma since February 2016, and likely jumped ship to join the rest of her family at Adidas.

The youngest self-made billionaire announced the news in the form of an Instagram Stories video, in which she can be seen wearing a pair of Adidas Falcon sneakers. So excited to announce that I am officially an #adidas Ambassador, she captioned the clip.

This explains why Jenner has been spotted wearing the brands sneakers almost exclusively as of late  as well as the personalized pairs that were sent to the stars friends and family in advance of her 21st birthday celebrations.

And with fashion week just around the corner, its pretty much guaranteed this new mom will be sporting three stripes."
2018-09-30,New York Post,Halsey celebrates best birthday ever with G-Eazy,"On Saturday, the Bad At Love crooner celebrated her special day in Italy with on-again beau G-Eazy, who shared a sincere message to the birthday girl on social media.

Happy birthday to this one. I love you so so so much and I always will, the 29-year-old rapper wrote. I myself, along with millions and millions of other people appreciate you more than youll ever know. Youre the brightest star in the sky. So grateful to get to travel thru life with you, so happy to call you my queen. Happy birthday baby.

Halsey later commented, best birthday ever, along with four heart emojis. The pop star also posted a shot of G-Eazy dining in a wine cellar at the Osteria Francescaana eatery in Moderna, Italy.

The singers birthday celebrations come two months after she and G-Eazy first called it quits. The pair sparked rumors of a reunion in late August, after packing on the PDA during the rappers concert in Holmdel, New Jersey.

On Sunday, Halsey thanked fans for their birthday wishes with a scenic snap.

Away message  thanks for all the birthday love  Ill start responding soon.....as soon as this view stops looking so good...., she wrote on Instagram."
2018-07-03,New York Post,Cardi B is too tired for pregnancy sex but not for twerking,"Cardi B has a lot to celebrate lately, but she wont be doing so in the bedroom.

The Bronx native became the first female rapper ever to have two No. 1 Hot 100 singles, courtesy of monster hits Bodak Yellow and I Like It, Billboard reported Monday.

Cardi, 25, marked the milestone with an Instagram video of herself twerking in her home and shouting, Im No. 1! Im No. 1 again! And Im about to give birth, birth, birth.

The Be Careful crooner has previously lamented her inability to get intimate with newly-announced husband Offset because of her late-stage pregnancy with their daughter.

I wanna have sex but I [lose] my breath soo fast, she tweeted with a series of yawning and sad emojis.

When a fan responded that pregnancy sex is the best sex, Cardi quipped, Not at this last stage ... baby too big.

One thing she isnt concerned with, however, is whether or not Offset, 26, is still attracted to her.

In a makeup-free video celebrating her groundbreaking chart status, she told fans, I know I look a little fked up and st ... but I aint go out nowhere. Its hot as fk, Im pregnant as fk ... Who am I getting cute for? My na gonna fk me regardless!"
